   gamma-gamma ' cobalt-based superalloys
SO OCHRONA PRZED KOROZJA
AB This paper presents the oxidation behavior of tungsten-free gamma-gamma' Co-10Al- 5Mo-2Nb and Co-20Ni-10Al-5Mo-2Nb cobalt-based superalloys. This type of alloys is an alternative materials for tungsten contains alloys of Co-Al-W type with gamma'-Co-3(Al.W) intermetallic phase adequate to gamma'-Ni3Al phase identified in Ni based superalloys. Applications of Mo and Nb as a replacement of W is related to tendency to lowering the density of alloys. The investigation included thermogravimetric studies up to 1200 degrees C. The oxidized layer was evaluated, therein microstructure, chemical and phase composition analyses were performed using various methods, inclusive of x-ray diffraction, SEM/EDS analysis and light microscopy.

TI A new tungsten-free gamma-gamma ' Co-Al-Mo-Nb-based superalloy
SO SCRIPTA MATERIALIA
AB We present the first report of a tungsten-free cobalt-based superalloy having a composition Co-10Al-5Mo-2Nb. The alloy is strengthened by cuboidal precipitates of metastable Co-3(Al,Mo,Nb) distributed throughout the microstructure. The precipitates are coherent with the face-centred cubic gamma-Co matrix and possess ordered Ll(2) structure. The microstructure is identical to the popular gamma-gamma' type nickel-based superalloys and that of recently reported Co-Al-W-based alloys. Being tungsten free, the reported alloy has higher specific proof stress compared to existing cobalt-based superalloys. (C) 2014 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Effect of cobalt on microstructural parameters and mechanical properties

SO JOURNAL OF THE JAPAN INSTITUTE OF METALS
AB The alloying effect of Cobalt (Co) to microstructural parameters and mechanical properties, such as partitioning ratios of alloying elements and creep strength, of Re-bearing Ni-base single crystal superalloys have been investigated. The second generation single crystal superalloys, TMS-82 +, Ni-7.8Co-4.9Cr-1.9Mo-8.7W-5.3AI-6.0Ta-2.4Re-0.1Hf, in mass% (8Co) was compared to a Co-free (0Co) and 15 mass% Co (15Co) alloy which had the same chemical composition as TMS-82 + except that Co was changed.
   It was shown that the partitioning ratios of alloying elements tend to k(= X-y/K-y') = 1, as the content of Co was increased.
   Furthermore, it was found that there was suitable content of Co for the creep strength under various temperature-stress conditions.

TI Activity coefficients of NiO and CoO in CaO-Al2O3-SiO2 slag and their
   application to the recycling of Ni-Co-Fe-based end-of-life superalloys
   via remelting
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MINERALS METALLURGY AND MATERIALS
AB To design optimal pyrometallurgical processes for nickel and cobalt recycling, and more particularly for the end-of-life process of Ni-Co-Fe-based end-of-life (EoL) superalloys, knowledge of their activity coefficients in slags is essential. In this study, the activity coefficients of NiO and CoO in CaO-Al2O3-SiO2 slag, a candidate slag used for the EoL superalloy remelting process, were measured using gas/slag/metal equilibrium experiments. These activity coefficients were then used to consider the recycling efficiency of nickel and cobalt by remelting EoL superalloys using CaO-Al2O3-SiO2 slag. The activity coefficients of NiO and CoO in CaO-Al2O3-SiO2 slag both show a positive deviation from Raoult's law, with values that vary from 1 to 5 depending on the change in basicity. The activity coefficients of NiO and CoO peak in the slag with a composition near B = (%CaO)/(%SiO2) = 1, where B is the basicity. We observed that controlling the slag composition at approximately B = 1 effectively reduces the cobalt and nickel oxidation losses and promotes the oxidation removal of iron during the remelting process of EoL superalloys.

TI Application of thermodynamic calculations to study high temperature

SO CALPHAD-COMPUTER COUPLING OF PHASE DIAGRAMS AND THERMOCHEMISTRY
AB A database for cobalt-base superalloys was built up by combing the binary and ternary thermodynamic descriptions available in the SSOL (SGTE) database and from the literature. Using this database, results of thermodynamic calculations for several cobalt-base superalloys were compared to the experimentally observed n-microstructure of the alloys after homogenization at high temperatures and quenching. Three examples are presented: prediction of phase equilibria versus temperature and composition; selection of highly refractory materials using isothermal sections; and evaluation of local melting temperature in the case of skin formation of Co-base alloy during air oxidation at 1300 degreesC. The agreement between calculated prediction and experimental observation is satisfactory. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

SO CORROSION SCIENCE
AB Electrochemical properties of gamma'-strengthened Co-base superalloys with the composition Co-Al-W-B and Co-Al-W-B-Y are studied in comparison with pure Co at ambient temperature in 0.5 M NaCl aqueous solution (pH 5.8). The different materials exhibit comparable corrosion resistance with a limited initial passivation followed by severe pitting corrosion at higher potentials. Oxide layers, formed under isothermal oxidation at 800 and 900 degrees C, provide exceptional protection against pitting corrosion. No breakdown events are observed, even for thin layers formed during short-term oxidation (1 h at 900 degrees C). Si as alloying element further improves the corrosion behaviour of the oxidised alloy in NaCl. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Effect of cobalt on micro-structural parameters of Ni-base single
   crystal superalloys
SO JOURNAL OF THE JAPAN INSTITUTE OF METALS
AB Effect of Cobalt on micro-structural parameters, such as the lattice misfit and partitioning behaviors of alloying elements, of Re-bearing Ni-base single crystal superalloys have been investigated. The second-generation single crystal superalloys, TMS-82 + (Ni-7.8Co-4.9Cr-1.9Mo-8.7W-5.3Al-6.0Ta-2.4Re-0.1Hf, in mass%), was compared to a Co-free (0Co) alloy which had the same chemical composition as TMS-82+ except that Co was removed.
   The lattice misfit of 0Co alloy was found to be more negative value than that of TMS-82 + at any temperature. Additionally, when 0Co alloy was equilibrated at 1100 degrees C, Cr, Mo and W partitioned more into the gamma matrix; in contrast, Al and Ti partitioned into the gamma' precipitates. Increase in partitioning of Cr, Mo and W to the gamma phase resulted in an increase in the lattice parameter of gamma phase. Thus, lattice misfit of 0Co tend to more negative value than that of TMS-82 +.

AB This study reports the microstructural evolution, physical and mechanical properties of cobalt-based superalloys processed from mechanical alloyed powders and consolidated by field-assisted sintering techniques (FAST). After an initial thermodynamic simulation of the ternary diagram by Thermocalc (R) to determine the composition, a sequential milling process was carried out at room temperature up to 40 h milling of two different alloying systems: CO-12Al-10W (at%) and Co-12Al-10W-2Ti-2Ta (at%). Characterization of the powders was performed by using X-Ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and particle-size analyzer. Consolidated samples were also characterized in terms of density, microhardness and hardness. In order to promote the dual gamma/gamma' microstructure, both alloys were aged after solution annealing heat treatment, improving a new route of consolidation with a new level of performance.

TI Synthesis of a new tungsten-free gamma-gamma ' cobalt-based superalloy
   by tuning alloying additions
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB The paper presents the synthesis of a new class of gamma-gamma' cobalt-based superalloy that is free of tungsten as an alloying addition. It has much lower density and higher specific strength than the existing cobalt-based superalloys. The current superalloys have a base composition of Co-10Al and are further tuned by the addition of a binary combination of molybdenum and niobium, with the optimum composition of Co-10Al-5Mo-2Nb. The solvus temperature of the alloy (866 degrees C) can be further enhanced above 950 C by the addition of Ni to give the form Co-xNi-10Al-5Mo-2Nb, where x can be from 0 to 30 at.%. After heat treatment, these alloys exhibit a duplex microstructure with coherent cuboidal L1(2)-ordered precipitates (gamma') throughout the face-centred cubic matrix (gamma), yielding a microstructure that is very similar to nickel-based superalloys as well as recently developed Co-Al-W-based alloys. We show that the stability of the gamma' phase improves significantly with the nickel addition, which can be attributed to the increase in solvus temperature. A very high specific 0.2% proof stress of 94.3 MPa g(-1) cm(-3) at room temperature and 63.8 MPa g(-1) cm(-3) at 870 degrees C were obtained for alloy Co-30Ni-10Al-5Mo-2Nb. The remarkably high specific strength of these alloys makes this class of alloy a promising material for use at high temperature, including gas turbine applications. (C) 2014 Acta Materialia Inc.

TI Predicting the morphologies of gamma ' precipitates in cobalt-based
   superalloys
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB Cobalt-based alloys with gamma/gamma ' microstructures have the potential to become the next generation of superalloys, but alloy compositions and processing steps must be optimized to improve coarsening, creep, and rafting behavior. While these behaviors are different than in nickel-based superalloys, alloy development can be accelerated by understanding the thermodynamic factors influencing microstructure evolution. In this work, we develop a phase field model informed by first-principles density functional theory and experimental data to predict the equilibrium shapes of Co-Al-W gamma ' precipitates. Three-dimensional simulations of single and multiple precipitates are performed to understand the effect of elastic and interfacial energy on coarsened and rafted microstructures; the elastic energy is dependent on the elastic stiffnesses, misfit strain, precipitate size, applied stress, and precipitate spatial distribution. We observe characteristic microstructures dependent on the type of applied stress that have the same gamma ' morphology and orientation seen in experiments, indicating that the elastic stresses arising from coherent gamma/gamma ' interfaces are important for morphological evolution-during creep. The results also indicate that the narrow gamma channels between gamma ' precipitates are energetically favored, and provide an explanation for the experimentally observed directional coarsening that occurs without any applied stress.

TI Effect of Al and W Contents on the Solidification and Solution
   Microstructure of Novel gamma/gamma ' Cobalt-Base Superalloys
SO ADVANCED ENGINEERING MATERIALS
AB The solidification and heat treatment characteristics of superalloys are key to engineering and practical applications. The solidification and solid solution behavior of gamma/gamma ' cobalt-base superalloys Co-30Ni-xAl-(15 - x)W-5Cr-1Ta-4Ti (x = 7, 9, 11 abbreviated as 7Al8W, 9Al6W, and 11Al4W, respectively) are studied using directional solidification experiments. The results indicate that there are Laves phase, (gamma + gamma ')(e) eutectics, and (beta + gamma ')(e) eutectics in the interdendritic regions for the 7Al8W alloy. The solidification sequence of the 7Al8W alloy is L -> L-1 + gamma -> L-2 + gamma + Laves -> L-3 + gamma + Laves + (beta + gamma ')(e) -> L-4 + gamma + Laves + (beta + gamma ')(e) + (gamma + gamma ')(e) -> gamma + Laves + (beta + gamma ')(e) + (gamma + gamma ')(e). As the Al content increases and the W content decreases, the Laves phase fraction in the alloy decreases and the (beta + gamma ')(e) eutectics fraction increases. The Laves phase completely disappears in the 11Al4W alloy. An unremovable mu phase forms in the 7Al8W alloy during solution treatment. The 9Al6W alloy and 11Al4W alloy can exhibit a gamma single-phase microstructure after single-stage solution treatment (1250 degrees C for 1 h) and two-stage solution treatment (1210 degrees C for 1 h + 1275 degrees C for 1 h), respectively. These experimental results are helpful for composition optimization, solidification, and solution treatment parameter determination of novel gamma/gamma ' cobalt-base superalloys.

   systems
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB The Co-Ta-V and Co-Nb-V ternary systems are investigated in a search for L1(2)-ordered gamma' precipitation, based on recent computational predictions of stable gamma+gamma' microstructures. Four alloys with nominal (at. %) composition Co-6Ta-6V, Co-5.4Ta-6.6V-xNi (x = 0 and 10), and Co-6Nb-6V are arc-melted, homogenized at 1250 degrees C, and aged at 900 degrees C for 2,16 and 64 h. Nanometric, cuboidal gamma' precipitates within a fcc-gamma matrix are discovered in the Co-Ta-V system after aging for 2 h, and in the Co-Nb-V system after cooling from homogenization. The compositions of these two new gamma'-phases, as measured via atom probe tomography, are Co-3(Ta0.76V0.24) and Co-3(Nb0.65V0.35), respectively. Upon aging at 900 degrees C, the gamma' precipitates coarsen, dissolve and transform to lamellar C36-Co-3(Ta,V) and needle-shape DO19-CO3(Nb,V), measured as Co-3(Nb0.81V0.19) by APT, respectively. This shows that these ternary gamma' phases are metastable and points to the need for their stabilization via additional alloying elements. (C) 2018 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Creep strength of Co-free Ni-base single crystal superalloys
SO JOURNAL OF THE JAPAN INSTITUTE OF METALS
AB The Pebble Bed Modular Reactor (PBMR) is a small atomic power reactor which can be used in areas where the electric power transmission network is not well developed. It generates electricity by gas-turbines that used He-gas as a coolant. Ni-based superalloys are the primary materials used in gas-turbines. However if conventional Ni-base superalloys are to be used for PBMR, turbine maintenances will be difficult due to Co, as it can produce Co-60 a recitative material that possesses a long half-life. Therefore, Co-free Ni-base superalloys are required for PBMR.
   In this paper, a Co-free single-crystal (SC) superalloy, TMS-82 + (-Co), was developed; it was the same chemical composition as the 2(nd) generation SC superalloy, TMS-82+, except that it is Co-free creep tests were performed on the developed alloy, TMS-82 +, under three conditions; 900 degrees C/392 MPa, 1000 degrees C/245 MPa, and 1100 degrees C/137 MPa; CMSX-4, a popular SC alloy, was used as comparison.
   TMS-82 + (-Co) displayed superior creep-rupture life in all creep tests; however, detrimental TCP were observed in the microstructure of the sample that underwent creep testing at 1100 degrees C/137 MPa. This, the developed Co-free SC alloy should be further modified for long-term microstructural stability. Elimination of phase formation will allow the alloy to be utilized in the PBMR.

TI Thermodynamic Considerations of Contamination by Alloying Elements of
   Remelted End-of-Life Nickel- and Cobalt-Based Superalloys
SO METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS B-PROCESS METALLURGY AND
   MATERIALS PROCESSING SCIENCE
AB Cobalt and nickel are high-value commodity metals and are mostly used in the form of highly alloyed materials. The alloying elements used may cause contamination problems during recycling. To ensure maximum resource efficiency, an understanding of the removability of these alloying elements and the controllability of some of the primary alloying elements is essential with respect to the recycling of end-of-life (EoL) nickel- and cobalt-based superalloys by remelting. In this study, the distribution behaviors of approximately 30 elements that are usually present in EoL nickel- and cobalt-based superalloys in the solvent metal (nickel, cobalt, or nickel-cobalt alloy), oxide slag, and gas phases during the remelting were quantitatively evaluated using a thermodynamic approach. The results showed that most of the alloying elements can be removed either in the slag phase or into the gas phase. However, the removal of copper, tin, arsenic, and antimony by remelting is difficult, and they remain as tramp elements during the recycling. On the other hand, the distribution tendencies of iron, molybdenum, and tungsten can be controlled by changing the remelting conditions. To increase the resource efficiency of recycling, preventing contamination by the tramp elements and identifying the alloying compositions of EoL superalloys are significantly essential, which will require the development of efficient prior alloy-sorting systems and advanced separation technologies.

TI Isothermal aging of a gamma '-strengthened Co-Al-W alloy coated with
   vacuum plasma-sprayed MCrAlY bond coats
SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB Cobalt-based superalloys with a gamma/gamma' microstructure were discovered in 2006 and are currently being investigated as an alternative to nickel-based superalloys for high-temperature, high-load applications in gas turbine blades. They promise a better castability combined with a similar creep strength. Superalloy turbine blades are commonly coated with oxidation resistant bond coats. For this reason their compatibility needs to be studied. Co-9Al-9W specimens with a gamma/gamma' microstructure were coated with either a nickel-based or cobalt-based MCrAlY bond coat using vacuum plasma spraying. After aging at 900 degrees C in air for up to 500 h no decomposition of the gamma' phase was found in the bulk superalloy. The interdiffusion zone shows several different W-rich topologically close-packed phases arising from the dissolution of the gamma' phase in this region. The W-rich phases are identified to be mu phase for both bond coats and R phase for the nickel-based bond coat only. Their total volume is higher for the nickel-based bond coat. Therefore the cobalt-based bond coat is better suited for the Co-based superalloy substrate. Room temperature hardness and Young's modulus were measured using nanoindentation in the initial state and after heat treatment. A significantly higher Young's modulus was found for the cobalt-based bond coat (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Microstructure characterization of Co-20Cr-(5,10)Al oxide dispersion
   strengthened superalloys
SO MATERIALS CHARACTERIZATION
AB In order to develop Co-based oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) superalloys with excellent mechanical properties and oxidation resistance at the temperature above 1000 degrees C, Co-20Cr-(5,10)Al ODS superalloys were designed and fabricated by mechanical alloying (MA), spark plasma sintering (SPS), hot rolling and the final annealing at 1200 degrees C. Two different phases were identified; the Co solid solution of a fcc structure, and the B2 phase highly enriched with Aluminum. Composition and volume fraction of both phases are almost consistent with the Co-Cr-Al ternary phase diagram computed with the Pandat software. Another coarse fcc phase with smaller content of oxide particles was also characterized. This phase was probably formed through an incipient melting at the initial stage of SPS process. Fine oxides particles are densely distributed inside both, the fcc solid solution and the B2 phase. Grain boundaries and phase boundaries are decorated with the oxide particles, which are beneficial to grains and phases stability at elevated temperature. The observed unique core-shell structure was characterized as Y2Hf7O17 type in a core and Y2Hf2O7 type at a periphery of the oxide particles. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI On the grain boundary strengthening effect of boron in gamma/gamma '
   Cobalt-base superalloys
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB Boron is an essential solute element for improving the grain boundary strength in several high temperature metallic alloys especially in Ni- and Co-base superalloys although the detailed strengthening mechanisms are still not well understood. In superalloys, boron leads to the formation of borides and precipitate depleted zones around the grain boundaries and alters the bond strength among the grains directly. In this paper, we explore in detail the role of the boron content in ternary gamma/gamma' Co-9Al-9W alloys. Local as well as bulk mechanical properties were evaluated using nanoindentation and compression testing and correlated to near-atomic scale microstructure and compositions obtained from electron microscopy and atom probe tomography.
   The alloy variant with low B content (0.005 at.% B) reveals an increase in yield strength at room temperature and 600 degrees C and atom probe tomography investigations show that solute B segregates to the grain boundaries. However, in the bulk B exclusively partitions to the gamma' phase. Additionally, the gamma/gamma' grain boundaries are depleted in W and Al with the concentration locally shifted towards the gamma composition forming a very thin gamma layer at the gamma/gamma' grain boundaries, which supports dislocation mobility in the gamma/gamma' grain boundary region during deformation. Higher content of B (0.04 at.% B) promotes formation of W-rich borides at the grain boundaries that leads to undesirable precipitate depleted zones adjacent to these borides that decrease the strength of the alloy drastically. However, it was also found that a subsequent annealing heat treatment eliminates these detrimental zones by re-precipitating gamma' and thus elevating the strength of the alloy.
   This result shows that, if a precipitate depleted zone can be avoided, B significantly improves the mechanical properties of polycrystalline Co-base superalloys by strengthening the gamma' phase and by improving grain boundary cohesion.

TI A new class of high strength high temperature Cobalt based gamma-gamma '
   Co-Mo-Al alloys stabilized with Ta addition
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB The present paper reports a new class of Co based superalloys that has gamma-gamma' microstructure and exhibits much lower density compared to other commercially available Co superalloys including Co-Al-W based alloys. The basic composition is Co-10Al-5Mo (at%) with addition of 2 at% Ta for stabilization of gamma' phase. The gamma-gamma' microstructure evolves through solutionising and aging treatment. Using first principles calculations, we observe that Ta plays a crucial role in stabilizing gamma' phase. By addition of Ta in the basic stoichiometric composition Co-3(Al, Mo), the enthalpy of formation (Delta H-f) of L1(2) structure (gamma' phase) becomes more negative in comparison to DO19 structure. The All of the L12 structure becomes further more negative by the occupancy of Ni and Ti atoms in the lattice suggesting an increase in the stability of the gamma' precipitates. Among large number of alloys studied experimentally, the paper presents results of detailed investigations on Co-10Al-5Mo-2Ta, Co-30Ni-10Al-5Mo-2Ta and Co-30Ni-10Al-5Mo-2Ta-2Ti. To evaluate the role alloying elements, atom probe tomography investigations were carried out to obtain partition coefficients for the constituent elements. The results show strong partitioning of Ni, Al, Ta and Ti in ordered gamma' precipitates. 2015 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Energetics of antiphase boundaries in gamma ' Co3(Al,W)-based
   superalloys
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB Although Co-based superalloys are considered as a promising next-generation high-temperature turbine blade material, there are issues with regard to mechanical properties that must be addressed. L1(2) planar defects such as antiphase boundaries (APBs) play a critical role in the high-temperature strength of gamma/gamma ' superalloys, particularly with the magnitude and temperature-range of the yield strength anomaly. APBs in L1(2) Co-3(Al,W) gamma ' are particularly complex due to the presence of the metal mixing on the Al/W sublattice, which introduces additional degrees of freedom to APB behavior, such as Al/W composition and configuration local to the APB. We explore the behavior of APBs in L1(2) Co-3(Al,W) with density functional theory. We find a strong dependence of the APB energy on the composition, particularly from the presence of Al-Al bonds across the 010 APB and W-W bonds across the 111 APB. For both APBs, our calculations also suggest an energetically favorable segregation of Al to the APB. Therefore, future Co alloy design criteria can include alloying elements with preferential segregation to the APB over that of Al to tune the APB energy (and the behavior of the yield strength anomaly). Furthermore, the unique behavior of Al-Al and W-W bonds in the 010 and 111 APB's, respectively, indicate the possibility of preferentially modifying one APB over another with alloying.

TI Effect of Al, Ti and Cr additions on the gamma-gamma' microstructure of
   W-free Co-Ta-V-Based superalloys
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB The recently-discovered metastable gamma'-Co-3(Ta0.76V0.24) phase formed on aging in a Co-6Ta-6V (at.%) ternary alloy is stabilized by partial replacement of Ta and V with Al and Ti. In two alloys with composition Co-6Al-3Ta-3V and Co-5Al-3Ta-3V-1Ti with gamma+gamma' microstructure, the gamma'-precipitates remain stable for up to 168 h at 850 and 900 C, with no precipitation of additional phases. Adding Ni and B and doubling the Ti concentration produces a gamma/gamma' superalloy, Co-10Ni-5Al-3Ta-3V-2Ti-0.04B (at.%), with gamma' precipitates which are stable up to six weeks of aging at 850 degrees C, while slowly coarsening and coalescing from cuboidal to elongated shapes. After one day of aging at 850 degrees C, the gamma' nanoprecipitates have a (Co0.83Ni0.17)(3)(Ta0.42Al0.23Ti0.19V0.15B0.01) composition, with Al and Ti replacing at the same rate both Ta and V in the original metastable Co-3(Ta0.76V0.24) phase. To improve oxidation resistance, 4% Cr is added to the new superalloy, resulting in a somewhat higher volume fraction of finer cuboidal gamma' precipitates after one week of aging at 850 degrees C, but no other deleterious phases. These W-and Mo-free gamma/gamma' superalloys show good creep resistance at 850 degrees C, on par with two other recent Co-base gamma/gamma' superalloys: (i) Co-9W-9Al-8Cr (at.%) which has higher density due to its high W content, and (ii) Co-30Ni-10Al-5Mo-2Nb (at.%) which has lower density (as it is W-free) but contains triple the Ni concentration.

AB The influence of cobalt (5 and 16 at %) and chromium (4.25 at %) on the structure of a (beta-NiAl + gamma'-Ni3Al + gamma-Ni) alloy with 27 at % Al of the Ni-Al-Co system, which is chosen as the basis of alloys with given physicochemical properties, in particular, moderate density (<= 7.2 g/cm(3)) and sufficient heat resistance at 1100-1300 degrees C, is studied. A high stability of the high-temperature. phase is found. It forms upon solidification according to the reaction L reversible arrow beta + gamma and is nonequilibrium at 1200 and 1300 degrees C (below the temperatures of the transformations beta + gamma reversible arrow beta + gamma + gamma' reversible arrow beta + gamma'). The volume fraction of the gamma-Ni phase increases with the cobalt content or upon chromium addition in comparison with its fraction in the base alloy. The influence of alloying on the cobalt and chromium distribution in alloy phases is estimated. Additional alloying increases the differences in the phase compositions in cobalt and chromium.

TI Effect of Cr addition on gamma-gamma ' cobalt-based Co-Mo-Al-Ta class of
   superalloys: a combined experimental and computational study
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB The present article deals with effect of Cr addition (10 at.%) on the partitioning behavior and the consequent effect on mechanical properties for tungsten-free gamma-gamma' cobalt-based superalloys with base alloy compositions of Co-30Ni-10Al5Mo- 2Ta (2Ta) and Co-30Ni-10Al-5Mo-2Ta-2Ti (2Ta2Ti). Cr addition leads to a change in the morphology of the strengthening cuboidal-shaped gamma' precipitates to a spherical shape. The site preference of Cr atoms in two alloy systems (with and without Ti) has been experimentally investigated using atom probe tomography with the supportive prediction from first principles DFT-based computations. Cr partitions more to the c matrix relative to gamma'. However, Cr also has a strong effect on the Ta and Mo partitioning coefficient across gamma/gamma' interfaces. The value of partition coefficient for Mo (K-Mo) becomes <1 with Cr addition to the alloys. Results from ab initio calculations show that the Cr atoms prefer to replace Mo atoms in the sublattice sites of the Ll(2) unit cell. The solvus temperature of about 1038 and 1078 degrees C was measured for 10Cr2Ta and 10Cr2Ta 2Ti alloy, respectively, and these Cr-containing alloys have very low densities in the range of similar to 8.4-8.5 gm/cm(-3). The 0.2% compressive proof strength of 10Cr2Ta2Ti alloy yields a value of 720 MPa at 870 degrees C, substantially better than most Co-Al-W-based alloys and many of the nickel-based superalloys (e.g., MAR-M-247).

SO CORROSION SCIENCE
AB Isothermal oxidation in air was carried out on a gamma'-strengthened single crystalline Co-Al-W-B superalloy at 800, 900, and 1000 degrees C. The absence of grain boundaries leads to inferior oxidation properties at 800 and 900 degrees C, and improved properties at 1000 degrees C, compared to a polycrystalline alloy of the same composition. At lower temperatures, grain boundary diffusion is dominant and assumed to be the reason for enhanced B-accumulation in the inner oxide layer and enhanced formation of the protective inner Al2O3 layer. However, at 1000 degrees C superior oxidation resistance of the single crystalline superalloy can be observed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI A Novel Type of Environmentally Friendly Slurry Coatings
SO JOM
AB A variety of commercial slurries are available to aluminize the surfaces of nickel-based superalloys; however, they have three main disadvantages. First, the phosphates and chromates or halides used as binders or to activate the diffusion species are environmentally harmful and toxic; second, the slurry coatings can only produce high-aluminum-activity coatings which form precipitate-rich coatings that are detrimental to adherence. Finally, these coatings are limited to the incorporation of aluminum and silicon, whereas the co-deposition of other elements such as chromium or cobalt has not been achieved so far. In this work, the limitations of slurry coatings have been overcome by carefully designing the powder composition and controlling the process to produce co-deposition coatings with chromium, cobalt, or nickel by using nontoxic water-based slurries. This also opens an effective way to control Al activity and to produce low-activity aluminized coatings for the first time when using the slurry technique. These results expand the application range of slurry coatings so they can also be applied under ambient atmosphere, making it possible to fully coat aero engine pieces or large-scale industrial components, providing all properties that are usually only achieved by using more complex and expensive methods such as chemical vapor deposition. Furthermore, these new coatings offer unique advantages that can be very favorable especially as a repairing technique.

TI Thermal Analysis in the Technological "Step" Test of H282 Nickel Alloy
SO ARCHIVES OF FOUNDRY ENGINEERING
AB Superalloys show a good combination of mechanical strength and resistance to surface degradation under the influence of chemically active environments at high temperature. They are characterized by very high heat and creep resistance. Their main application is in gas turbines, chemical industry, and in all those cases where resistance to creep and the aggressive corrosion environment is required. Modern jet engines could never come into use if not for progress in the development of superalloys. Superalloys are based on iron, nickel and cobalt. The most common and the most interesting group includes superalloys based on nickel. They carry loads at temperatures well in excess of the eighty percent of the melting point. This group includes the H282 alloy, whose nominal chemical composition is as follows (wt%): Ni - base, Fe - max. 1.5%, Al - 1.5% Ti - 2.1%, C - 0.06% Co - 10% Cr - 20% Mo - 8.5%. This study shows the results of thermal analysis of the H282 alloy performed on a cast step block with different wall thickness. Using the results of measurements, changes in the temperature of H282 alloy during its solidification were determined, and the relationship dT / dt = f (t) was derived. The results of the measurements taken at different points in the cast step block allowed identifying a number of thermal characteristics of the investigated alloy and linking the size of the dendrites formed in a metal matrix (DAS) with the thermal effect of solidification. It was found that the time of solidification prolonged from less than ome minute at 10 mm wall thickness to over seven minutes at the wall thickness of 44 mm doubled the value of DAS.

TI ANALYSIS OF THE INFLUENCE OF CHEMICAL COMPOSITION AND TEMPERATURE ON
   MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF SUPERALLOYS NIMONIC 80A
SO METALURGIJA
AB Superalloys Nimonic 80A is a wrought nickel base alloy (min. 65 % Ni) and chromium (20 %), with minor additions of carbon, cobalt and iron, as well as major alloying elements of aluminum (1 to 1,8%) and titanium (1,8 to 2,7 %). Chemical composition of the alloy Nimonic 80A has a dominant influence on its mechanical and technological properties. Increasing of the temperature also has a large influence on the mechanical properties of superalloy Nimonic 80A
   Investigations which were carried out have included chemical testing and testing of mechanical properties of superalloy Nimonic 80A at room and higher temperatures. Regression analysis was done on the base of chemical analyses and results of mechanical properties. The results of regression analysis are equations by which on the basis of known chemical composition, ie content of main alloying elements Al, Ti and Co, the mechanical properties of materials at room and higher temperatures can be predicted.

TI A study on the effect of composition, and the mechanisms of

AB The effect of composition on recrystallisation of single crystal Ni-based superalloys was studied in a series of alloys that vary systematically in composition. Following room temperature macro-indentation and subsequent annealing, alloys containing higher Co concentration showed greater susceptibility to recrystallisation, and this has been attributed to the effect on the gamma' solvus temperature and the stacking fault energy of the gamma phase. Mo, W and Ru did not appear to influence the recrystallisation behaviour systematically, although high concentration of all these elements led to the highest recrystallisation. Moreover, with grain orientation mapping, it was found that the nucleating recrystallisation grains form in orientations similar to the deformed regions, and subsequently twin to form higher angle boundaries and proliferate further within the deformed microstructure. The effects of the interaction between grain boundaries and secondary phases, such as the gamma' and topologically close packed phases, were also studied.

TI On the effect of Re addition on microstructural evolution of a
   CoNi-based superalloy
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB In this study, the effect of rhenium (Re) addition on microstructural evolution of a new low-density Co-Ni-Al-Mo-Nb based superalloy is presented. Addition of Re significantly influences the gamma' precipitate morphology, the gamma/gamma' lattice misfit and the gamma/gamma' microstructural stability during long term aging. An addition of 2 at.% Re to a Co-30Ni-10Al-5Mo-2Nb (all in at.%) alloy, aged at 900 degrees C for 50 h, reduces the gamma/gamma' lattice misfit by similar to 40% (from +0.32% to +0.19%, measured at room temperature) and hence alters the gamma' morphology from cuboidal to round-cornered cuboidal precipitates. The composition profiles across the gamma/gamma' interface by atom probe tomography (APT) reveal Re partitions to the gamma phase (K-Re = 0.34) and also results in the partitioning reversal of Mo to the gamma phase (K-Mo = 0.90) from the gamma' precipitate. An inhomogeneous distribution of Gibbsian interfacial excess for the solute Re (Gamma(Re), ranging from 0.8 to 9.6 atom.nm(-2)) has been observed at the gamma/gamma' interface. A coarsening study at 900 degrees C (up to 1000 h) suggests that the coarsening of gamma' precipitates occurs solely by evaporation-condensation (EC) mechanism. This is contrary to that observed in the Co-30Ni-10Al-5Mo-2Nb alloy as well as in some of the Ni-Al based and high mass density Co-Al-W based superalloys, where gamma' precipitates coarsen by coagulation/coalescence mechanism with an extensive alignment of gamma' along <100> directions as a sign of microstructural instability. The gamma' coarsening rate constant (K-r) and gamma/gamma' interfacial energy are estimated to be 1.13 x 10(-27) m(3)/s and 8.4 mJ/m(2), which are comparable and lower than Co-Al-W based superalloys.

TI Creep deformation-induced antiphase boundaries in L1(2)-containing
   single-crystal cobalt-base superalloys
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB Creep-induced antiphase boundaries (APBs) in new Co-base single-crystal superalloys with coherent embedded L1(2)-gamma' precipitates have been observed. APBs formed during single-crystal tensile creep tests performed at 900 degrees C under vacuum at stresses between 275 and 310 MPa. The alloys investigated contained 30-39 at.% Ni, which was added to the Co-Al-W ternary system to expand the gamma-gamma' phase field and increase the gamma'-solvus. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) using two-beam conditions with fundamental and superlattice reflections was performed for defect characterization. The Burgers vector b of dislocations associated with the APBs was determined to be of type b = a(0)/2[011] and a(0)/2[01 (1) over bar]. The displacement vectors, R, of the APBs matched the dislocation Burgers vectors, with R = b = a(0)/2[011]. APBs were observed in nearly every precipitate beyond 0.5% creep strain for the compositions investigated. The implications for high-temperature properties are discussed.

TI Cobalt-base high-temperature alloys
SO SCIENCE
AB We have identified cobalt-base superalloys showing a high-temperature strength greater than those of conventional nickel-base superalloys. The cobalt-base alloys are strengthened by a ternary compound with the L1(2) structure, gamma ' Co-3( Al,W), which precipitates in the disordered gamma face-centered cubic cobalt matrix with high coherency and with high melting points. We also identified a ternary compound, gamma ' Ir-3(Al, W), with the L1(2) structure, which suggests that the Co-Ir-Al-W-base systems with gamma + gamma ' (Co, Ir)(3)(Al, W) structures offer great promise as candidates for next-generation high-temperature materials.

TI Heat-resistant alloys based on intermetallic Co-3(Al, W)
SO DOKLADY CHEMISTRY
AB The structures and phase compositions of a series of Co-9 at % Al-x at % W alloys (where x = 4.6, 6.8, 8.5, 10.0, 12.6) have been studied. All of them are dominated by the structure gamma + gamma', with the content of other phases (the mu phase and the phase D0(19) based on Co3W) being insignificant. With increasing tungsten content of the alloy (to 10 at % W), the volume fraction of the gamma' phase increases, and so does its degree of long-range order. The alloy that is optimal in structure and mechanical properties has the composition Co-8.2 at % Al-8.5 at % W. The dissolution range of the gamma' phase was determined as 920-1054A degrees C. Young's moduli of cobalt alloys exceed E of commercial nickel-based superalloys. The samples of the studied alloys are in the ferromagnetic state with a Curie temperature of 870A degrees C. With increasing tungsten content of the alloy, its saturation magnetization decreases and the coercive force increases. The coercive force is minimal in an as-cast sample and increases as it is subjected to deformation or heat treatment.

TI New observations of a nanoscaled pseudomorphic bcc Co phase in bulk
   Co-Al-(W,Ta) superalloys
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB The influence of composition on microstructural phase stability has been assessed for an emerging class of Co-based superalloys. This has been achieved using a combinatorial approach that incorporates both material synthesis and state-of-the-art characterization techniques. A compositionally graded Co-11Al-xW-yTa alloy (x <= 10, y=10-x, all in wt.%) was produced using Laser Engineered Net Shaping (LENS') and subsequently solutionized and water quenched. At selected locations along the gradient, the microstructures present were characterized in detail, and phase identification was conducted on site-specific thin specimens using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), providing details regarding the earliest stages of microstructural evolution in these alloys. The partitioning behavior of the alloying elements W, Ta and Al was characterized using a 3-D local electrode atom probe, revealing the existence of Co-rich clusters. In addition, high-resolution TEM and precession electron diffraction have revealed and confirmed that these clusters are a pseudomorphic body-centered cubic (bcc) structure that has resulted from the decomposition of a B2 ordered region. Although bcc Co has previously been reported in some thin-film multilayers, owing to the relative stabilities of the bcc phase and the face-centered cubic (fcc) phase, this observation has not been previously reported in bulk structural materials. It is argued that this nanoscaled pseudomorphic bcc Co phase may be a precursor to the fcc phase. (C) 2014 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The present study aims to characterization of new gamma-gamma' Co-10Al-5Mo-2Nb (at.%) cobalt-based superalloy performance in terms of the high-temperature exposure under cyclic conditions, with particular regard to surface condition. Specimens were tested in cycles of high-temperature exposition (25, 50, 75, 100 and 150 h) in air environment at 800 A degrees C. Detailed analysis of oxidized surfaces by scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction was made at various intervals during testing. The cyclic oxidation behavior of new alloy was compared to the basic Co-9Al-9W (at.%) Co-based superalloy.

AB Cobalt-based gamma-gamma' superalloys are novel heat-resistant materials suitable for high-temperature applications, such as components of the turbine engine. These alloys exhibit favorable strength and corrosion resistance at high temperatures owing to the gamma-gamma' microstructure, analogous to that of Ni-based superalloys. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the oxidation behavior of basic Co-9Al-9W (at%) and new tungsten-free Co-10Al-5Mo-2Nb (at%) alloys at elevated temperatures. The investigation is concerned with thermogravimetric studies in the temperature range of 40-1200 degrees C. The oxidized surfaces after high temperature oxidation have been characterized using optical microscopy (OM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD).

   Co-10Ni-6Al-(0,2,4,6) W-6Ti (at%) cobalt-based superalloys
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB The effects of reducing the W concentration (and concomitantly mass density) of Co-10Ni-6A1-xW-6Ti at% Co-based superalloys, with a gamma(f.c.c.) plus gamma'(L1(2)) microstructure, is investigated for a series of alloys with W concentrations of 6 at% (baseline alloy), 4 and 2 at% (W-reduced) and 0 at% (W-free). The gamma'(L1(2)) solvus temperature decreases strongly (by 46 degrees C per 1 at% reduction in W), while the liquidus and solvus temperatures decrease mildly (3-5 degrees C per 1 at% W reduction) as measured by differential scanning calorimetry. Scanning electron microscopy was used to image phase formation in all alloys. When aging at 900 or 1000 degrees C for 256 h, the W reduction does not result in the appearance of additional phases within the grains beyond the gamma(f.c.c.) and gamma'(L1(2)) phases present in the original alloy. Grain-boundary precipitates are present for all alloy compositions: W-rich or W-free precipitates after aging at 1000 degrees C, and coarsened gamma'(L1(2)) precipitates after aging at 900 degrees C. The composition of grain boundary precipitates were measured with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Vickers microhardness values decrease with decreasing W content, due to a reduction in gamma'(L1(2)) precipitation and 'reduced solid-solution strengthening.

TI Effect of Cr on the Oxidation Resistance of Co-Based Oxide Dispersion
   Strengthened Superalloys
SO MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS
AB Alumina-forming oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) superalloys are favorable oxidation-resistant materials for extremely high temperature applications. In order to develop the advanced Co-based superalloys with high strength and superior oxidation resistance at elevated temperature of 1000 degrees C, a new series of Co-Cr-Al ODS superalloys were designed and fabricated by mechanical alloying (MA) and spark plasma sintering (SPS), and then followed by hot rolling and annealing at 1200 degrees C. In this work, the oxidation behavior of Co-10Al (mass%) ODS superalloys with/without 20Cr was investigated at 1000 degrees C in air to understand the effect of Cr on oxidation resistance. The results indicate that the addition of Cr improves the oxidation resistance significantly through optimizing the oxide scales from the multilevel scales with an external CoO/CoAl2O4 and an internal Al2O3 to a single layer of Al2O3. The alumina-forming Co-20Cr-10Al (mass%) ODS superalloys are expected to be applicable at 1000 degrees C.

   Ageing Behavior at 900 degrees C
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB It has been pointed out recently that the compositions of industrial alloys are originated from cluster-plus-glue-atom structure units in solid solutions. Specifically for nickel-based superalloys, after properly grouping the alloying elements into Al, Ni-like ((Ni) over bar, including Ni, Co, Fe, Re, Ru and Ir), gamma '- forming Cr-like ((Cr) over bar (gamma '), including Ta, Ti, V, Nb), and gamma-forming Cr-like ((Cr) over bar;(gamma), including Cr, Mo and W), the optimal formula for single-crystal superalloys has been established [Al-(Ni) over bar (12)] (Al-1(Cr) over bar (gamma ')(0.5)(Cr) over bar (gamma)(1.5)). In this work, the first generation single-crystal superalloys were investigated on the basis of the proposed formula, by using (Ni) over bar=(Ni and Co), (Cr) over bar (gamma ')=(Ta and Ti), and (Cr) over bar (gamma)=(Cr, Mo and W). Two series of alloys were designed, formulated respectively as group A: [Al-Ni11Co1] (Al1TaxTi0.5-xCr1W0.25Mo0.25), with x=0, 0.25 and 0.5 (the corresponding mass fractions of Ta and Ti are respectively 0Ta-2.65Ti, 4.82Ta-1.26Ti and 9,32Ta-0Ti), and group B: [Al-Ni12-yCo gamma](Al1Ta0.25Ti0.25Cr1W0.25MO0.25), with y=1.5, 1.75, 2 and 2.5 (the corresponding mass fractions of Co are respectively 9.43Co, 11Co, 12.57Co and 15.71Co). The single-crystal superalloys were prepared using selector technique. And then they underwent the following tests of incipient melting, standard heat treatment and 1000 h long term ageing at 900 degrees C. It is found that: (1) In group A, with increasing Ta content (decreasing Ti), all the incipient melting temperatures are increased to above 1330 degrees C, and to the highest value is between 1335 degrees C and 1340 degrees C for alloy 9.32Ta-0Ti; the gamma(')gamma(') lattice negative misfits after standard heat treatment are reduced from -0.262% (0Ta-2.65Ti) to -0.247% (9.32Ta-0Ti); the gamma(') coarsening tendency after long-term ageing is deduced, and alloy 9.32Ta-0Ti has the lowest coarsening rate (K=5.6x10(-5) mu(3)/h). (2) In group B, the Co content does not influence the incipient melting temperature (always above 1330 degrees C) and the coarsening rate of gamma(') after long-term ageing. The major role of Co is to increase the mean size of the gamma(') precipitates to about 0.55 pm and the gamma(') volume fraction to about 69% after the standard heat treatment. These two groups of alloys have their gamma(') coarsening rates approaching the level of third-generation single-crystal superalloys (K approximate to(2.08 similar to 3.82)*10(-5) mu m(3)/h).

TI Effects of Nb and W Additions on the Microstructures and Mechanical
   Properties of Novel gamma/gamma' Co-V-Ti-Based Superalloys
SO METALS
AB Microstructures, elemental partition behavior, phase stabilities and mechanical properties of Nb- and W-containing Co-V-Ti-based superalloys were investigated. Elemental partition coefficients (K-X = C-gamma/C gamma) of Nb and W in Co-V-Ti-based superalloys are 2.07 and 1.10, respectively. The gamma' solvus temperatures are determined as 1023 degrees C, 1055 degrees C and 1035 degrees C in Co-12V-4Ti, Co-10V-4Ti-2Nb and Co-10V-4Ti-2W alloys, which are higher than those of Co-9Al-9W alloy (1000 degrees C). The mass densities of quaternary Co-10V-4Ti-2Nb and Co-10V-4Ti-2W alloys are about 8.31 and 8.50 g.cm(-3), respectively, which are 15% lower than Co-Al-W-based superalloys (9.8 g.cm(-3)). All examined alloys exhibit an anomalous positive dependence on temperature rising from 600 to 750 degrees C. Strengths of all examined alloys are higher than those of MarM509 (traditional Cobalt-based superalloy) and Co-9Al-9W at all temperatures that we investigated. The maximum flow stress of Co-V-Ti-Nb alloy is about 638 MPa at 750 degrees C while that of Co-V-Ti-W alloy is about 588 MPa at 700 degrees C.

TI Thermogravimetric investigations of new gamma-gamma' cobalt-based
   superalloys
SO JOURNAL OF THERMAL ANALYSIS AND CALORIMETRY
AB The aim of the study is characterization of high-temperature oxidation behavior of new Co-based superalloys by thermogravimetry (TG). The following alloys have been taken into account: Co-9Al-9W, Co-20-Ni-7Al-7W, Co-10Al-5Mo-2Nb and Co-20Ni-10Al-5Mo-2Nb (at.%). The thermogravimetric analysis was carried out in the temperature range 40-1200 degrees C of heating rate 5 degrees min(-1). The investigation was performed using the thermal analyzer NETZSCH STA 449 F3 Jupiter. TG-DTG plots showed oxidation behavior up to 1200 degrees C and indicated the temperatures of further isothermal oxidation examinations. The oxidation behavior of basic Co-9Al-9W (at.%) alloy was compared to W-free Co-10Al-5Mo-2Nb and Co-20Ni-10Al-5Mo-2Nb (at.%) alloys. The obtained data showed different oxidation behavior dependably on the type of alloying elements. Moreover, the effect of Ni addition on oxidation performance was determined. The scales grown on Co-base superalloys after thermogravimetry were evaluated by means of scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy.

TI Beyond Ni-based superalloys: Development of CoRe-based alloys for gas
   turbine applications at very high temperatures
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MATERIALS RESEARCH
AB High temperature material development is mainly driven by gas turbine needs. Today, Ni-based superalloys are the dominant material class in the hot section of turbines. Material development will continue to push the maximum service temperature of Ni-superalloys upwards. However, this approach has a fundamental limit and cannot be sustained indefinitely, as the Ni-superalloys are already used very close to their melting point. Within the framework of a DFG Forschergruppe program (FOR 727) - "Beyond Ni-base Superalloys" - CoRe based alloys are being developed at the Technische Universitat Braunschweig as a new generation of high temperature materials that can be used at + 100 degrees C above single crystal Ni-superalloys. Two main strengthening concepts, namely precipitation hardening by MC carbides and composite hardening by Co(2)Re(3)-type phase are being explored in CoRe alloy development. Selected results of microstructural characterizations, including in-situ measurements by synchrotron and neutron scattering are presented.

TI Corrosion Behavior of Cobalt-Based Superalloys with Tellurium in Molten
   Salt
SO RARE METAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING
AB The corrosion behavior in high temperature molten salt of cobalt-based alloy powder with different Te contents that was sintered under non-vacuum environment was investigated in a static 800 +/- 5 degrees C and 75% Na2SO4+25% NaCl. The microstructure, corrosion product morphology and phase composition were investigated by OM, SEM and XRD, respectively. The results show that with the increase of Te mass fraction in cobalt-based alloy, the high-temperature molten salt corrosion rate decreases gradually; when the Te content is about 1.6%, a kind of homogeneous and dense Cr2O3 protection oxide film forms on the surface of the alloy substrate and the new phase (CoTeO3, Fe2TeO5) dispersed in the matrix inhibits Co atoms from diffusing to grain boundaries, which retard alloy matrix element dissolution and improve the hot corrosion performance of the alloy. The corrosion rate of cobalt-based alloy decreases from 4.0483 mg/(cm(2).h) of the Te-free alloy to 0.216 mg/(cm(2).h).

TI Intermediate Co/Ni-base model superalloys - Thermophysical properties,
   creep and oxidation
SO SCRIPTA MATERIALIA
AB The mechanical properties of gamma'-strengthened Co-Ni-Al-W-Cr model superalloys extending from pure Ni-base to pure Co-base superalloys have been assessed. Differential scanning calorimetry measurements and thermodynamic calculations match well and show that the gamma' solvus temperature decreases with increasing Co-content The gamma/gamma' lattice misfit is negative on the Ni- and positive on the Co-rich side. High Ni-contents decelerate the oxidation kinetics up to a factor of 15. The creep strength of the Ni-base alloy increases by an order of magnitude with additions of Co before it deteriorates strongly upon higher additions despite an increasing gamma' volume fraction.

TI L1(2)-Strengthened Cobalt-Base Superalloys
SO ANNUAL REVIEW OF MATERIALS RESEARCH, VOL 45
SE Annual Review of Materials Research
AB The discovery of the gamma'-Co-3(Al,W) phase with an L1(2) structure provided Co-base alloys with a new strengthening mechanism, enabling a new class of high-temperature material: Co-base superalloys. This review discusses the current understanding of the phase stability, deformation, and oxidation behaviors of gamma' single-phase and gamma + gamma' two-phase alloys in comparison with Ni-base gamma'-L1(2) phase and gamma + gamma' superalloys. Relatively low stacking fault energies and phase stability of the gamma' phase compared with those in Ni-base alloys are responsible for the unique deformation behaviors observed in Co-base gamma' and gamma + gamma' alloys. Controlling energies of planar defects, such as stacking faults and antiphase boundaries, by alloying is critical for alloy development. Experimental and density functional theory studies indicate that additions of Ta, Ti, Nb, Hf, and Ni are effective in simultaneously increasing the phase stability and stacking fault energy of gamma'-Co-3(Al,W), thus improving the high-temperature strength of Co-base gamma' phase and gamma + gamma' two-phase superalloys.

TI Regulating the coarsening of the gamma ' phase in superalloys
SO NPG ASIA MATERIALS
AB The properties of superalloys are typically deteriorated by the coarsening of the nano-sized gamma' phase, which is the primary strengthening component at high temperatures. Stabilizing the gamma' phase represents one of the key challenges in developing next-generation superalloys. Herein, we fabricate a cobalt-nickel-based superalloy with a nanoscale coherent gamma' phase, (Ni,Co)(3) (Al, Ti, Nb), which is isolated by stacking-fault ribbons in the alloy matrix as a result of the Suzuki segregation of alloying atoms. Additionally, we demonstrate that this new nanostructure can slow down the coarsening of the gamma' phase at high temperatures. As a result, the cobalt-nickel-based superalloy displays considerably high tensile yield points, exceeding 1650 MPa at room temperature and 1250 MPa at 973 K, which are markedly higher than those of the commonly used nickel-and cobalt-based superalloys. This study thereby paves a new path for developing superalloys with exceptional mechanical performance and thermal stability.

SO JOURNAL OF PHASE EQUILIBRIA AND DIFFUSION
AB Diffusion couple experiments between various Co-rich face centered cubic (FCC) alloys in the Co-W-Al ternary system have been conducted at 900 and 1000 A degrees C. Diffusion coefficients have been extracted for the Co-W binary and for ternary alloys at compositions where the diffusion paths cross. In addition, a least squares method has been utilized to optimize diffusion mobility parameters using DICTRA simulations to best fit the experimental concentration versus distance curves. Predictions of the diffusion matrix using the refined mobility database are in good agreement with the values obtained at the diffusion path crossing points.

TI Identification of a ternary mu-phase in the Co-Ti-W system - An advanced
   correlative thin-film and bulk combinatorial materials investigation
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB The formation of a ternary It-phase is documented for the system Co-Ti-W. The relevant compositional stability range is identified by high-throughput energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, electrical resistance and X-ray diffraction maps from a thin-film materials library (1} mu m thickness). Bulk samples of the identified compositions were fabricated to allow for correlative film and bulk studies. Using analytical scanning and transmission electron microscopy, we demonstrate that in both, thin film and bulk samples, the D85 phase (is-phase) coexists with the 06-phase and the A2-phase at comparable average chemical compositions. Young's moduli and hardness values of the mu-phase and the C36-phase were determined by nanoindentation. The trends of experimentally obtained elastic moduli are consistent with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. DFT analysis also supports the experimental findings, that the it-phase can solve up to 18 at.% Ti. Based on the experimental and DFT results it is shown that CALPHAD modeling can be modified to account for the new findings. (C) 2017 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Isothermal oxidation tests conducted at 900, 1000, and 1150 A degrees C indicated that silicon addition can improve oxidation resistance. Furthermore, the alloy content of tungsten can have profound impact on the oxidation behaviour; low content of tungsten can promote the formation of protective alumina at temperatures at and above 1000 A degrees C, while high tungsten content can slow down oxidation at 900 A degrees C.

The lattice misfit is sufficiently low to form coherent cuboidal gamma' precipitates. Atom probe tomography shows that Cr partitions to the gamma phase, but increases the gamma' volume fraction compared to a binary Co-Ti alloy to more than 60 %. The solubility of Cr in the gamma' phase is significantly higher than expected from previously published values. The gamma' solvus temperature is above 1100 degrees C. The yield strength shows a distinct increase above 600 degrees C surpassing that of Co-9Al-8W (at.%) and conventional Co-base superalloys, even more so when it is normalized by the mass density.

TI Site occupancy of alloying elements in the L1(2) structure determined by
   channeling enhanced microanalysis in gamma/gamma ' Co-9Al-9W-2X alloys
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB Knowledge about the sublattice site preference of alloying elements in the L1(2)-gamma' phase of novel Co-base superalloys is a necessary pre-requisite to understand their influence on the properties of the alloys in general and the gamma' phase in particular. In the present study, the atomic site occupancy of the alloying elements in the L1(2)-gamma' structure in Co-9Al-9W-2X quaternary alloys after long-term annealing at 900 degrees C for 5000 h was determined using the atom location by channeling enhanced microanalysis (ALCHEMI) technique in combination with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) composition analysis in a transmission electron microscope (TEM). The experimental ALCHEMI data were evaluated by comparing them with those calculated by the program 'Inelastic Cross Section Calculator' (ICSC). The results show that Co mainly occupies one sublattice site and Al/W are located at the other sublattice site in the L1(2) unit cell in the ternary alloy. The additional elements Ti, V, Mo and Ta which partition strongly to the gamma' phase tend to occupy the Al/W sublattice site, and Cr which partitions more to the gamma phase also favors the AI/W sublattice site, while Ni weakly partitions into the gamma' phase and favors the Co sublattice site. The results of this study can provide evidence to the predictions on the site preference in literature based on the phase composition or on theoretical studies. (C) 2018 Acta Materialia Inc.

TI Synthesis of simple and platinum-modified aluminide coatings on cobalt
   (Co)-base superalloys via a vapor phase aluminizing process
SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB An investigation was conducted to synthesize simple beta-CoAl or beta-(Co,Ni)Al coatings and platinum (Pt)-modified aluminide coatings on cobalt-base superalloys via an industrial vapor phase aluminizing process. Surface morphology and cross-section microstructure of the developed coatings were studied and compared by using optical microscope, scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). Experimental results showed that Al increase in Al-Cr nuggets increases the coating thickness; substrate elements influence the formation of coatings; the increase of the electrodeposited Pt thickness increases the amount of xi PtAl(2) phase after aluminizing process; and the transformation of xi PtAl(2) phase into beta-(Co,Ni,Pt)Al phase can be obtained via a heat treatment process.

TI The importance of sign and magnitude of gamma/gamma ' lattice misfit in
   superalloys-with special reference to the new gamma '-hardened
   cobalt-base superalloys
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB In this work, the remarkable high-temperature strength properties of monocrystalline gamma'-hardened Ni-base superalloys are reviewed with the goal of understanding better the important role played by the gamma/gamma' lattice misfit delta with respect to microstructural stability and high-temperature creep and fatigue resistance. In particular, attention is focussed on the phenomenon of microstructural degradation by directional coarsening in the form of gamma/gamma' rafting which also occurs in turbine blades in service. The role played by the lattice misfit (which is negative for all currently used Ni-base superalloys) is elucidated with respect to its sign, magnitude and temperature dependence. Based on a detailed discussion of high-temperature deformation involving gamma/gamma' rafting, it is argued that superalloys with a positive gamma/gamma' lattice misfit should exhibit better high-temperature strength properties than otherwise similar superalloys with a negative misfit. In this context, the new class of gamma'-hardened Co-base superalloys is of special interest. These alloys have promising high-temperature strength properties and possess a positive lattice mismatch. It is suggested that this positive mismatch is one of the beneficial factors that contribute to the promising properties of these alloys and that this aspect should be explored further.

TI Formation of Cuboidal Co3AlC Precipitates in Carbon-Containing
   Co-Al-W-Based Superalloys
SO ADVANCED ENGINEERING MATERIALS
AB The influence of Carbon addition on a ternary Co-Al-W alloy is investigated especially regarding phase stability and partitioning behavior of alloying elements. During casting and subsequent cooling, C-additon leads to the formation of an interdendritic carbide network and to the homogeneous precipitation of cuboidal E2(1) phase, Co3AlC, in the W-rich Co matrix. The solvus temperature of this phase is found to be about 1200 degrees C, which is significantly higher than the solvus temperature of the ternary L12 phase Co-3(Al,W). In the course of solution heat treatment, the Co3AlC precipitates are dissolved and the carbides change in morphology and chemical composition. Further annealing leads to the precipitation of small cuboidal precipitates of L1(2) phase, Co-3(Al,W), and to a discontinuous precipitation of further phases.

TI High temperature oxidation behaviour of gamma '-strengthened Co-based
   superalloys with different Ni addition
SO CORROSION SCIENCE
AB High temperature oxidation behaviours of gamma'-strengthened Co-based superalloys with various Ni additions were investigated at both 800 degrees C and 900 degrees C. The results show that the superalloys show excellent oxidation resistance due to the formation of compact spinel oxide scales. With the increasing of Ni addition, the concentration of Cr in scale/alloy interface will be increased but that of Co will be decreased. And the growth of Cr2O3 will be promoted, while CoO nucleation will be hindered. Therefore, increasing Ni addition helps the formation of protective spinel oxide scales and delays nodular oxidation, which favours to be better oxidation resistance.

SO CORROSION SCIENCE
AB Isothermal oxidation was carried out on new gamma/gamma'-strengthened Co-base superalloys of the system Co-Al-W-B and Co-Al-W-B-Cr at 800 and 900 degrees C in air. ToF-SIMS investigations show that boron accumulates in the inner oxide layer which improves the oxidation behaviour and oxide layer adhesion considerably. B-rich precipitations can be observed in the alloy matrix, as well. Appropriate amounts of chromium as additional alloying element lead to further improvement of the oxidation resistance due to the formation of protective inner Al(2)O(3) and Cr(2)O(3) scales.

TI Effect of Al content on the high-temperature oxidation of
   Co-20Cr-(5,10)Al oxide dispersion strengthened superalloys
SO CORROSION SCIENCE
AB The high-temperature oxidation of Co-based oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) Co-20Cr-(5, 10) Al-2.4Hf-1.5Y(2)O(3) (wt%) superalloys was investigated at 900 C-omicron and 1000 C-omicron. The 10Al (wt%) superalloys possess better oxidation resistance with the formation of alumina scale than the 5Al (wt%) with a duplex scale of CoCr2O4/Cr2O3 and internal Al2O3. The alumina on the 10Al superalloy is composed of theta- and alpha-alumina at 900 C-omicron but dominated by alpha-alumina at 1000 C-omicron. The lower weight gain of 10Al superalloys at 1000 C-omicron than at 900 C-omicron was associated with different growth mechanisms of the Al2O3 scales. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The effects of Mn content on the oxidation behaviour of a Co-base superalloy with compositions of Co-29Cr-21Ni-23Fe-2.2Nb-1.6Si-xMn (x=0, 0.5, 1, 2) (Co22 alloy for short, wt.%) have been studied. Isothermal oxidation behaviour was investigated, and it showed kinetics of the Mn-containing samples followed a two-stage parabolic law. In the absence of Mn, scales on Co22 alloys consisted mainly of Cr2O3 and SiO2, and small amounts of Fe-Cr, Ni-Cr spinel nodules formed on the surface. When Mn was added, a triple oxide layer could be observed, consisting of Mn-Cr spinel as outer layer, Cr2O3 as middle layer and SiO2 in the innermost layer. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Effect of alloying on the oxidation behaviour of Co-Al-W superalloys
SO CORROSION SCIENCE
AB The 800 degrees C isothermal and cyclic oxidation of alloys based on Co-7A1-7W (at.%) was examined. Cr, Fe and Si additions were beneficial. Repeated oxide bilayers formed during cycling of non-Cr alloys, which were not protective (>100 mu m thick). In these layers, the outer was Co3O4 and the inner, a porous Co3O4 and Al2O3 mixture. 10 at.% Cr substitution for Co was sufficient to produce a protective, similar to 1 mu m thick scale which contained an outer layer of Al2CoO4, a very thin (100 nm) middle layer of Cr2O3 and an inner layer of Al2O3. Therefore protective oxide scales are possible in gamma/gamma', Co-Co-3(AL,W) superalloys. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Improvement of the high temperature oxidation of TaC-strengthened
   Co(Cr)-based cast superalloys by the addition of nickel
SO CORROSION ENGINEERING SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB In this work, nickel is added in substitution to cobalt in the composition of a cast cobalt-based chromium-rich superalloy designed to obtain a double-phased {fcc matrix + TaC} microstructure. Two nickel amounts were tested, 13 and 26 wt-%Ni, for 25 wt-%Cr, 0.4 wt-%C and 6 wt-%Ta, the rest being cobalt. The obtained as-cast microstructures are not different from the starting alloy's one, contrarily to the hardness which became lower. The oxidation tests at 1200 degrees C for 170 h demonstrated a significant improvement of the alloy's behaviour, especially for an addition of 26 wt-%Ni. This seems to be attributed to an easier Cr diffusion towards the oxidation front as suggested by the observed Cr contents in extreme surface as well as by the lower Cr concentration gradients. In addition, the TaC seemed to be morphologically more stable in the presence of nickel in the alloys than in the absence of Ni.

TI Thermodynamic stability of Co-Al-W L1(2) gamma '
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB Co-based superalloys in the Co-Al-W system exhibit coherent L1(2) Co-3(Al,W) gamma' precipitates in an face-centered cubic Co gamma matrix, analogous to Ni3Al in Ni-based systems. Unlike Ni3Al, however, experimental observations of Co-3(Al,W) suggest that it is not a stable phase at 1173 K. Here, we perform an extensive series of density functional theory (DFT) calculations of the gamma' Co-3(Al,W) phase stability, including point defect energetics and finite-temperature contributions. We first confirm and extend previous DFT calculations of the metastability of L1(2) Co-3(Al0.5W0.5) gamma' at 0 K with respect to hexagonal close-packed Co, B2 CoAl and D0(19) Co3W using the special quasi-random structure (SQS) approach to describe the Al/W solid solution, employing several exchange/correlation functionals, structures with varying degrees of disorder, and newly developed larger SQSs. We expand the validity of this conclusion by considering the formation of antisite and vacancy point defects, predicting defect formation energies similar in magnitude to Ni3Al. However, in contrast to the Ni3Al system, we find that substituting Co on Al sites is thermodynamically favorable at 0 K, consistent with experimental observation of Co excess and Al deficiency in gamma' with respect to the Co-3(Al0.5W0.5) composition. Lastly, we consider vibrational, electronic and magnetic contributions to the free energy, finding that they promote the stability of gamma', making the phase thermodynamically competitive with the convex hull at elevated temperature. Surprisingly, this is due to the relatively small finite-temperature contributions of one of the gamma' decomposition products, B2 CoAl, effectively destabilizing the Co, CoAl and Co3W three-phase mixture, thus stabilizing the gamma' phase.

AB Two cast and heat-treated NbC and TaC - strengthened cobalt superalloys have been developed for an investment casting of spinner discs for glass wool industry. In this work constant load creep tests in tension were carried out in argon atmosphere at three testing temperature 900, 950 and 1000 degrees C and at the initial applied stresses ranging from 40 to 200 MPa. All the tests were continued until the final fracture. The results of creep testing were combined with microstructural and fractographic examinations by means of light and scanning electron microscopy. A mutual comparison of creep characteristics of the investigated superalloys under comparable creep loading conditions showed that NbC-strengthened superalloy exhibited longer creep life than TaC-strengthened one. Further, it was found that carbide precipitation is the primary strengthening mechanism in both cobalt-base superalloys under investigation and the amount, morphology and type of carbides have the decisive effect on the creep properties including creep damage and fracture processes. By contrast, CoNb superalloy exhibited a more brittle character of creep fracture mode than CoTa superalloy due to a premature fracture. This study was initiated to investigate in more details operating creep deformation processes and the effect of the creep microstructure and damage evolution on both investigated superalloys. The different behaviour and properties of studied superalloys were explained based on the received results of this study.

AB Although Ni-base superalloys meet the gas turbine needs of today, they are used very close to their melting range. Demands for applications at higher temperatures are presently met partly through component cooling and application of thermal barrier coatings. However, this approach can not be sustained indefinitely unless the base metal melting temperature is also significantly increased. Rhenium addition can substantially increase the melting point in Co-base alloys and thereby provide a unique opportunity in the development of new alloys for very high temperatures - e.g. for applications at +100 degrees C metal temperature above present day single crystal Ni-base superalloys. The design considerations behind the Co-Re alloy development are presented in this paper. Selected results from the alloy development studies are also presented.

SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Novel Cr containing Co-Al-W base superalloys were studied by atom probe tomography and neutron diffraction. Cr is found to predominantly partition to the gamma matrix decrease partitioning of W to gamma'. Furthermore, Cr significantly enhances the gamma' volume fraction, decreases the gamma/gamma' lattice misfit and deteriorates the creep resistance. Addition of Ni to the Cr containing alloys affects partitioning of W and Al, further decreases the lattice misfit and results in the formation of irregularly shaped precipitates. Al, W and Cr tend to occupy the 'B' sublattice in the gamma'-A(3)B phase (L1(2) type), while Co and Ni reside in the 'A' sublattice.

TI Coarsening behaviour and interfacial structure of gamma ' precipitates
   in Co-Al-W based superalloys
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB This work discusses the effects of alloying on the coarsening behaviour of the L1(2) ordered gamma' phase and the structure of the gamma/gamma' interfaces in three Co-Al-W base superalloys aged at similar to 90 degrees C below the respective solvus temperatures: Co-7Al-7W, Co-10Al-5W-2Ta and Co-7Al-7W-20Ni (at.%). The coarsening kinetics are adequately characterised by the classical Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner model for Ostwald ripening. Co-7Al-7W exhibited much slower coarsening than its quaternary derivatives. Alloying can be exploited to modify the coarsening kinetics either by increasing the solvus temperature by adding tantalum, or by adding nickel to shift the rate controlling mechanism towards dependence on the diffusion of aluminium rather than tungsten. Lattice resolution STEM imaging was used to measure the widths of the order disorder (structural) and Z-contrast (compositional) gradients across the gamma/gamma' interfaces. Similarly to nickel base superalloys, the compositional gradient was found to be wider than the structural. Co-7Al-7W-20Ni had much wider interface gradients than Co-7Al-7W and Co-10Al-5W-2Ta, which suggests that its gamma' phase stoichiometry is less constrained. A possible correlation between temperature and misfit normalised r vs. t(1/3) coarsening rate coefficients and the structural gradient width has also been identified, whereby alloys with wider interfaces exhibit faster coarsening rates.

TI Early stages of scale formation during oxidation of gamma/gamma'
   strengthened single crystal ternary Co-base superalloy at 900 degrees C
SO CORROSION SCIENCE
AB A study on the individual role of gamma and gamma'-phase during the scale formation on Co-9Al-9W (at.%) at 900 degrees C was conducted. High-accuracy thermogravimetric analysis was used to locate changes in the kinetics of scale growth. Compositions of three separated layers within the scale have been elucidated in detail. The results demonstrate the substantial impact of the two-phase microstructure on the initiation of oxidation for the appearance of the scale. Examination of STEM-EDX elemental mappings of the internal oxidation front during the early stages of scale growth can explain the origin of isolated Al2O3 precipitates instead of a closed protective layer.

TI Creep deformation of single crystals of new Co-Al-W-based alloys with
   fcc/L1(2) two-phase microstructures
SO PHILOSOPHICAL MAGAZINE
AB The creep deformation behaviour of single crystals of Co-Al-W-based alloys with gamma + gamma' two-phase microstructures has been investigated in tension under a constant stress of 137MPa in air at 1000 degrees C as a function of the gamma' solvus temperature and the volume fraction of the gamma' phase. When described by the creep strain rate versus time curve, the creep deformation of Co-Al-W-based alloys consists of transition and accelerating regions without a steady-state region, as observed in many modern nickel-based alloys. However, the creep strength of the present Co-Al-W-based alloys is comparable with nickel-based superalloys of the first generation but is much weaker than those of the second and higher generations. Unlike in nickel-based superalloys, the so-called p (parallel)-type raft structure, in which the gamma' phase is elongated along the tensile axis direction, is formed during creep in Co-Al-W-based alloys, being consistent with what is expected from the positive values of lattice misfit between the gamma and gamma' phases. As a result, of the alloys investigated, the best creep properties are obtained with the alloy possessing the highest volume fraction (85%) of the gamma' phase, which is far larger than usual for nickel-based superalloys (55-60%).

TI Experimental study and thermodynamic modeling of the Al-Co-Cr-Ni system
SO SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY OF ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB A thermodynamic database for the Al-Co-Cr-Ni system is built via the Calphad method by extrapolating re-assessed ternary subsystems. A minimum number of quaternary parameters are included, which are optimized using experimental phase equilibrium data obtained by electron probe micro-analysis and x-ray diffraction analysis of NiCoCrAlY alloys spanning a wide compositional range, after annealing at 900 degrees C, 1100 degrees C and 1200 degrees C, and water quenching. These temperatures are relevant to oxidation and corrosion resistant MCrAlY coatings, where M corresponds to some combination of nickel and cobalt. Comparisons of calculated and measured phase compositions show excellent agreement for the beta-gamma equilibrium, and good agreement for three-phase beta-gamma-sigma and beta-gamma-alpha equilibria. An extensive comparison with existing Ni-base databases (TCNI6, TTNI8, NIST) is presented in terms of phase compositions.

TI Creep properties of different gamma '-strengthened Co-base superalloys
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB The influence of various alloying elements on the creep properties of polycrystalline Co-base superalloys hardened by a ternary L1(2) compound, Co-3(Al,W) (gamma'-phase), was investigated. A Ti containing quaternary alloy shows creep strength similar to Ni-base superalloys IN100 and IN713C at 850 degrees C and strongly superior to conventional Co-base superalloys as Haynes188. The activation energy for creep between 850 and 950 degrees C is similar to the polycrystalline Ni-base superalloy IN100 in the same temperature range. Strengthening of the grain boundaries by third phase precipitates was found to be crucial for the mechanical properties. This can be achieved either by precipitation of borides or by additional intermetallic phases which precipitate due to oversaturation. During compressive creep at 850 degrees C only a slight tendency for directional coarsening occurs, while at 950 degrees C distinct gamma/gamma'-rafts perpendicular to the external compressive stress axis are formed which indicate a positive lattice misfit even at 950 degrees C.

TI Influence of rhenium on gamma '-strengthened cobalt-base superalloys
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS RESEARCH
AB The element Re is known to be a very potent strengthener concerning the creep properties of Ni-base superalloys. In this paper the influence of Re on the properties of new gamma'-strengthened Co-base superalloys is addressed. Atom probe tomography reveals that Re partitions preferentially to the gamma phase, but not as pronounced as in ni-base superalloys. Nanoindentation and micro-pillar compression tests of the gamma' phase indicate an increase of the hardness and the critical resolved shear stress caused by a considerable concentration of Re in the gamma' phase. Creep investigations show that the positive effect of Re is by far not as pronounced as in Ni-base superalloys. Several effects, which can contribute to this behavior, such as the lower Re concentration in gamma and hence a slightly reduced effective diffusion coefficient, a smaller diffusion barrier of Re in Cocompared to Ni, a slightly lower lattice misfit and gamma' volume fraction of the Re-containing alloy, are discussed.

TI Effects of cobalt on creep rupture properties and dislocation structures
   in nickel base superalloys
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB The influences of cobalt (Co) on creep rupture lives and dislocation structures in nickel base superalloys with and without rhenium (Re) are investigated. The creep rupture test conditions were high temperature low stress (1100 degrees C/150 MPa), intermediate temperature and stress (982 degrees C, 1010 degrees C) and low temperature high stress (850 degrees C/586 MPa). The results show that increasing Co content could enhance the creep rupture lives at low and intermediate temperature, and does not degrade the creep rupture lives of alloys at high temperature. In Re-containing alloys, at high temperature low stress (1100 degrees C/150 MPa), the effects of Co on the dislocation structures are negligible, while at low temperature high stress (850 degrees C/586 MPa), stacking faults are generated in alloy with 12% Co, and in alloy with 3% Co and free of Co, gamma prime particles are sheared by dislocation pairs. In Re-free alloys, at intermediate temperature and stress (1010 degrees C/248 MPa), large quantities of stacking faults appear in alloy without Co, while in alloy having 12% Co, gamma prime particles are sheared by dislocation pairs coupled by anti-phase boundary (APB). The gamma prime sheared by stacking faults or by dislocation pairs coupled by APB depends on the competition of stacking faults energy and APB energy which is affected by temperature and the interaction of Re and Co.

TI Interdiffusion in Ni-Co-Re and Ni-Co-Ru systems

CY NOV 15-17, 2006
CL Sendai, JAPAN
AB The diffusion in Ni-Co-Re and Ni-Co-Ru systems have been investigated in the temperature range 1323-1523 K through the determination of the interdiffusion coefficients. The main interdiffusion coefficients of these systems were larger than the cross interdiffusion coefficients, indicating that the influences of the own concentration gradients of the elements were generally still dominant. From the ratio of the cross interdiffusion coefficient to the main one, |(D) over tilde (k)(ij)/(D) over tilde (k)(ii)|, it was found that the effect of Co on the diffusion of Re was more appreciable than that of Ru. Moreover, by the comparison between the diffusion in the binary Ni-Re and in the ternary Ni-Co-Re, it was clear that the presence of Co reduced the Re diffusivity in Ni. The results of this work reflect two folds; the attractive force exists between Co and Re, and the interatomic bonding of Co-Re seems to be stronger than that of Ni-Re.

The addition of Cr altered the oxide scale from the multilayered scale with an external Co oxide/CoAl2O4 and an inner Al2O3 to a single Al2O3 scale. Y2O3 addition increased oxidation mass gain slightly but improved spallation resistance of the external Al2O3 scale.

TI Effects of Co content on tensile properties and deformation behaviors of
   Ni-based disk superalloys at different temperatures
SO MATERIALS & DESIGN
AB Tensile properties of three Ni-based disk superalloys with 5 wt.%, 15 wt.% and 23 wt.% Co contents were investigated from room temperature (RT) to 725 degrees C with a constant strain rate of 3 x 10(-4) s(-1). It is found that addition of Co enhances the yield strength and the strain hardening capacity of the alloy in the studied temperature regime. It is due to the following two reasons: i.e. the interactions between a large volume fraction of fine secondary and tertiary gamma' precipitates with the dislocations in slip bands at lower temperatures and the formation of deformation microtwins at higher temperatures. However, the formation of deformation microtwins in the high Co-containing content alloy sharply decreases the ductility at higher temperatures. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

But these alloys also suffered from severe degradation where corrosion problem frequently encountered due to the presence of molten salt deposits. To obviate this problem, three nickel-and cobalt-based superalloys had been exposed to (Na2SO4-25% NaCl) at 900 degrees C for 100 cycles. The resulting corrosion products were characterized using scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy. It was observed that both Ni-based alloys exhibited improved corrosion resistance over the Co-based alloy in this aggressive environment. In Ni-based alloys, the scale contained oxides such as NiO, Cr2O3, Fe2O3, and spinel NiCr2O4, whereas in case of Co-based alloy, the scale contained CoO and CoNiO2.

TI gamma '-(L1(2)) precipitate evolution during isothermal aging of a

SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB The coarsening kinetics and elemental partitioning behavior of gamma'-(L1(2)) precipitates in a gamma(f.c.c.)-matrix for a model quaternary Co-8.8Al-8.9W-9.9Ni at.% superalloy are investigated utilizing isothermal aging conditions at 650, 800 and 900 degrees C. The gamma'-precipitate mean radius, number density, and volume fraction, at 800 and 900 degrees C, were studied using scanning electron microscopy; the calculated temporal exponents associated with coarsening of gamma'-precipitates display good agreement with model predictions for quasi stationary coarsening. An atom probe tomographic (APT) investigation of the aged gamma/gamma' microstructure at 650 degrees C demonstrates that the compositions and volume fractions of both phases vary continuously up to 4096 h. The aged microstructure at 650 degrees C consists of interconnected nanoscale gamma'-precipitates, corroborated utilizing SEM for the 4096 h aged-specimen. The activation energy for coarsening is estimated for the temperature range 650-900 degrees C to be 283 kJ mol(-1), in reasonable agreement with activation energies for diffusion of Al, W, and Ni in Co, suggesting that coarsening of gamma'-precipitates is limited by bulk-diffusion. APT measurements of specimens aged for 1024 hat 800 and 900 degrees C demonstrate that the isothermal aging temperature has a significant effect on the compositions and partitioning behavior of Co, Al, W and Ni between the gamma- and gamma'-phases. The partitioning ratio of the concentrations between the gamma'- and gamma-phases is largest for W, decreasing linearly from 5.3 +/- 0.1 at 650 degrees C to 2.1 +/- 1.2 at 900 degrees C, and smallest for Co, decreasing from 0.86 +/- 0.01 at 650 degrees C to 0.73 +/- 0.01 at 900 degrees C.

TI Cobalt based alloy PTA hardfacing on different substrate steels
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Components from equipment for different processing industries are exposed to severe service conditions. Parts are therefore manufactured so that specific demands can be met through adequate selection of surface processing techniques and hardfacing alloys. Whenever surface welding techniques are used to improve a component's performance, quality requirements such as controlled dilution of the deposited alloy by the substrate are a priority. This work has evaluated this interaction between a hardfacing Co based alloy and the substrate steel. A high carbon cobalt based alloy was 'plasma transferred arc' (PTA) deposited on three different substrate steels. The role of the chemical composition of the substrate on the characteristics of the coatings was evaluated for two sets of processing parameters, targeting two extreme dilution levels. Coatings characterisation was assessed through microstructure analysis, microhardness measurements, dilution levels, and wear rate measurements. Results showed that the influence of the substrate chemical composition was more significant for coatings of controlled low dilution deposits. The selection of the substrate steel affected dilution levels, microstructure, hardness values, and sliding wear rates exhibited by the coatings. On both sets of coatings deposits made on carbon steel gave better wear performance than those deposited on the stainless steels tested.

AB An emerging class of cobalt-based gamma'-strengthened alloys promises higher temperature capabilities compared to current Ni-base superalloys commonly used in aerospace and power generation applications. As with Ni-base alloys, high temperature coatings that enhance environmental resistance are desirable. Single crystal samples of Co-9.2Al-9.0W and Co-7.8Al-7.8W-4.5Cr-2.0Ta (at.%) were coated with vapour phase nickel aluminide and MCrAlY. Samples were subjected to cyclic oxidation at 1100 C with 300450 1-h cycles. Compared to NiAl-based coatings, the MCrAlY coatings exhibited superior adherence and an interdiffusion zone free of detrimental intermetallic phases. Evolution of microstructure during cycling is discussed with reference to the available thermodynamic data. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The corrosion currents (i(corr)) of coated and uncoated substrate after 1 h of immersion tested by potentiodynamic polarization in 3.5 wt% NaCl solutions are 9.73b x 10(-7) A/cm(2) and 1.31 x 10(-6) A/cm(2), respectively. With the immersion time extension, the i(corr) of the coating decreases and the values of vertical bar Z vertical bar by EIS increase, indicating that the electrochemical reaction rate of the coating becomes slower. The coating presents good corrosion resistance due to the Al2O3 formed on the surface.

AB The influence of several alloying elements on the microstructure and creep properties of polycrystalline Co-base superalloys hardened with the ternary Ll(2) compound, gamma'-Co-3( Al, W), are presented in this work. The stability of the gamma/gamma'-microstructure was investigated by long term aging at temperatures of 750 degrees C and 900 degrees C. High contents of chromium and iron destabilize the gamma/gamma'-microstructure. Additions of nickel widen the gamma/gamma'- two phase field. Discontinuous precipitation is observed only in the iridium-containing alloy during aging. In all other alloys no formation of further intermetallic phases are found even after 1000 hrs aging at 750 degrees C and 900 degrees C. Boron has been added for the formation of grain boundary strengthening intermetallic phases which leads to an adjacent gamma'-depleted zone. Nanoindentation shows that titanium improves its hardness. The creep strength of the studied alloys is sufficiently better than that of commercial carbide hardened polycrystalline Co-base superalloys and already close to gamma'-hardened Ni-base superalloys. An alloy containing 2 at.% titanium exhibited a creep strength comparable with the Ni-base alloy IN 100. The microstructure after creep tests at 950 degrees C showed rafting perpendicular to the compressive load axis, confirming the positive lattice misfit of the alloys at high temperatures which was determined with high energy X-ray diffraction.

TI Diffusion and gamma ' phase coarsening kinetics in ruthenium containing
   nickel based alloys
SO MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS
AB The present paper reports the interdiffusion of Re, W, Ru and Co in the binary and pseudo-binary Ni based alloys at 1523 K and the gamma' phase coarsening kinetics of model superalloys at 1324 K. Both Re and W concentration gradients caused Ru uphill diffusion in the respective pseudo-binary diffusion couple, whereas Ru concentration gradient promoted uphill diffusion for W but not for Re. Interestingly, Re uphill diffusion occurred under the influence of Co concentration gradient but the reverse effect was not observed. The cross interdiffusion coefficients qualitatively determined from the uphill diffusion profiles were in reasonable agreement with those reported previously. Comparison of the interdiffusion coefficients in the binary and the pseudo-binary diffusion couples showed that Ru and W decreased the diffusivity of each other whereas Co appeared to be more powerful barrier atoms than Ru to decrease the Re diffusivity. Furthermore, it was evident that the coarsening kinetics of the gamma' phase in both Ru-free and Ru-containing model superalloys were controlled by diffusion and Ru was found to have no effect on the rate constant of the gamma' phase coarsening.

TI High resolution energy dispersive spectroscopy mapping of planar defects
   in L1(2)-containing Co-base superalloys
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB Local chemical fluctuations in the vicinity of superlattice intrinsic stacking faults (SISFs) have been observed via high resolution energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping in new single crystal Co- and CoNi-base superalloys containing gamma'-(L1(2)) precipitates. The SISFs were formed during high temperature tensile creep at 900 degrees C. Chemical fluctuations were found to greatly influence the SISF energy, which was calculated from density functional theory in Co-3(Al, Ta, W) compounds at 0K. The local SISF structure was found to be comprised of four D0(19) (0001) planes that were enriched in W and Ta, as revealed by high resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HRSTEM) imaging and EDS mapping. The precipitates were determined to accommodate up to 22% of the plastic deformation accrued during an interrupted creep test to 0.6% creep strain. The driving forces for segregation are discussed, and new models for shearing of the ordered precipitates are proposed. (C) 2015 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Oxidation Behaviour of Model Cobalt-Rhenium Alloys During Short-Term
   Exposure to Laboratory Air at Elevated Temperature
SO OXIDATION OF METALS
AB The alloys being used in high-temperature systems such as stationary gas turbines and aircraft engines are iron-, cobalt- and nickel-based superalloys, amongst which the latter is the most widely used for highest temperatures. However, the use of Ni-based alloys is limited to temperatures below 1,100 A degrees C. The experimental Co-Re-based alloys are promising for high-temperature applications for service temperatures beyond 1,200 A degrees C. The purpose of the present investigations, at this still early stage of the alloy development, is to gain a first insight into the oxidation mechanisms and to find ways to improve oxidation resistance of this class of materials. Thermogravimetric studies in combination with microstructural examinations of six model Co-Re alloys with different compositions showed the negative influence of rhenium on the oxidation resistance of Co-based alloys due to evaporation of rhenium oxide(s). Oxidation at 1,000 A degrees C in air yielded an oxide scale, that consists of a Co-oxide outer layer on a thick and porous Co-Cr oxide and a semicontinuous and therefore non-protective Cr-oxide film on the base metal substrate. This allowed for the vaporization of rhenium oxide formed during oxidation and hence led to a loss of Re. Computer-aided thermodynamic calculations were carried out to supplement the experimental analyses and were found to reasonably predict the stability ranges of the various oxide phases observed.

TI Dependence of titanium carbide stability at elevated temperatures on Co
   content in Co(Ni)-25Cr-1.6Ti-0.4C superalloys
SO MATERIALS CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
AB Titanium carbides feature among the MC carbides which tend to crystallize with a script-like shape recognized to be favorable to mechanical strength at high temperature for equi-axed cast refractory alloys. Recent results demonstrated that script-like TiC can be successfully obtained in Co-based alloys while they are less stable than chromium carbides in nickel-based alloys. The present work aims to study whether the addition of cobalt to nickel-based alloys may stabilize TiC. This double investigation, by thermodynamic calculations and by the elaboration of a series of nickel-based alloys with an increasing part of cobalt, demonstrates that the progressive enrichment in cobalt tends favoring the presence of TiC instead chromium carbides. To obtain a majority of TiC, script-like shaped and in significant quantity, cobalt must be more present than nickel in the alloys. But this enrichment in cobalt deteriorates the good resistance against hot oxidation. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Polycrystalline Co-Al-W alloys with quaternary alloying substitutions have been studied to investigate whether this alloy system might be attractive as an alternative to Ni-base superalloys in high temperature applications. A process route for the alloys was developed and an initial aging heat treatment established. The initial findings indicate that the addition of Ti, Ta and Ni increases the solvus temperature, whereas the addition of Mo lowers it slightly. The addition of Ti, Ta and Ni to the base alloy increased the gamma' precipitate size, whereas the addition of Mo had a negligible effect. Diffraction measurements were performed using both X-ray and neutron scattering. Positive lattice misfit values were obtained at both room and elevated temperatures; moreover, the lattice misfit increased with temperature. The thermal expansion coefficient of the gamma phase was similar to reference data for Co, whereas the gamma' phase had a greater thermal expansion coefficient than the gamma phase. Finally, cyclic oxidation experiments have been carried out in air at 800 degrees C. The CoO scales grown were not protective, and the alloys suffered from spallation during cooling.

TI The influence of yttrium addition on thermogravimetric behaviour of new
   Co-10Al-5Mo-2Nb Co-based superalloy
SO OCHRONA PRZED KOROZJA
AB Characterization of oxidation resistance of new type of cobalt based superalloys were presented in this investigations. As a referential material the Co-10Al-5Mo-2Nb (at.%) was used as the tungsten-free version of basic Co-7Al-7W alloy. The investigated alloy was modified by addition of yttrium on the level of 0.5 at.% due to expectation of improvement of it oxidation resistance. Both Co-based superalloys were casted in Institute of Materials Engineering of Silesian University of Technology in Poland. The oxidation performance of alloys were made during thermogravimetric investigations at temperature range from 25 to 1200 degrees C. The main analyzed parameter was mass gain detected continuously during the test. After the test the overall and cross-sectional analysis of specimens was made. They included analysis of oxide layer morphology on the surface of specimens with characterization of phase constituent of oxide layer. The detailed analysis of oxidized layer was made by scanning electron microscopy method where distribution of alloying elements was made with special attentions on yttrium localization after the test in oxide zone. Obtained data showed that addition of Y has a strong influence on oxidation performance of new Co based superalloy. Those influence is demonstrated mainly by different morphology of final oxide zone with strong influence on Mo and Nb diffusion.

All alloys exhibited a gamma/gamma' microstructure with remarkably differing gamma' volume fractions. W, Ta, Ti, Nb and V increased the gamma' volume fraction and gamma' solvus temperature. An increased W content and alloying of additional elements, except Ir, decreased the liquidus temperature.

TI Influence of ruthenium on microstructural evolution in a model Co-Al-W
   superalloy
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB The effect of 2 at.% Ru addition on the elemental partitioning and microstructural evolution of a base Co-8.8Al-7.3W at.% superalloy, consisting of a gamma-(fcc) matrix with gamma'-(L1(2) structure) precipitates is studied using scanning electron microscopy and atom-probe tomography. Ruthenium partitions to the gamma'-precipitates in the Co-9.4A1-7.5W-2.1Ru at.% alloy with a partitioning coefficient, K-Ru(gamma'/gamma) = 1.27, after aging at 900 degrees C for 16 h, in contrast to the behavior observed in Ni-base superalloys and theoretically predicted for Co-base superalloys, for which Ru partitions preferentially to the gamma-phase. The addition of ruthenium does not significantly affect the gamma' volume-fraction or the coarsening kinetics of the gamma' precipitates compared to the base ternary alloy. The addition of Ru also leads, however, to a rapid discontinuous transformation of (gamma plus gamma'), which initiates at the grain boundaries after 128 h aging at 900 degrees C; (gamma plus gamma') is transformed into a lamellar phase mixture containing Co3W (D0(19)), fcc solid-solution (gamma), and Co(Al,W) (B2). After 256 h aging at 900 degrees C in the Ru-containing alloy, some grains have completely transformed, although regions of gamma plus gamma' persist. The base ternary Co Al W alloy does not exhibit a discontinuous transformation and contains a (gamma plus gamma') microstructure up to 1024 h of aging at 900 degrees C. (C) 2016 Acta Materialia Inc.

SO CORROSION ENGINEERING SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB This paper aims to investigate the hot corrosion resistance of high velocity oxy-fuel (HVOF) sprayed cobalt based (Stellite-6) and nickel based (Ni-20Cr) coatings deposited on the superalloy Superni-718 (Ni-19Cr-18.5Fe-5.13Ta-3.05Mo-0.9Ti-0.5Al-0.18Mn-0.18Si-0.15Cu0.04C) in the Na(2)SO(4)-60%V(2)O(5) salt environment at 900 degrees C under cyclic conditions. The X-ray diffractometry, scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive analysis and electron probe microanalyser techniques were used to study the corrosion products with respect to their morphology, phase composition and element concentration. The thermogravimetric technique was used to establish the kinetics of corrosion. The bare alloy underwent severe hot corrosion attack. The Ni-20Cr coating shows excellent hot corrosion resistance with negligible spallation, whereas Stellite-6 coating reveals less hot corrosion resistance and more spallation. The hot corrosion resistance of Ni-20Cr coating has been attributed to the formation of oxides of chromium, nickel and spinel of nickel chromium. The oxides of silicon, chromium, cobalt and spinels of cobalt-chromium and nickel-chromium have contributed for hot corrosion resistance of Stellite-6 coatings.

TI Effect of Co on microstructural stability of the third generation
   Ni-based single crystal superalloys
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS RESEARCH
AB The effect of Co on element segregation and microstructure is investigated in the third generation Ni-based single crystal superalloys with 4, 8.5, and 11.5 wt% Co addition. The results show that the increase of Co content leads to a severe element segregation in as-cast microstructure. After heat treatment, the size of gamma' phase is slightly reduced with Co content increase. During the thermal exposure, the gamma' phase coarsens gradually but its coarsening rate decreases with increasing Co content. In addition, some acicular and blocky topologically close-packed (TCP) phases are precipitated in 4% Co and 8.5% Co alloys. However, no TCP phase can be found in 11.5% Co alloy. Finally, it may be concluded that although a higher Co content is harmful for the element segregation, it is beneficial to maintain the cuboidal morphology of gamma' phase, decrease its coarsening rate, and impede the precipitation of TCP phase.

TI Lattice parameter misfit evolution during creep of a cobalt-based
   superalloy single crystal with cuboidal and rafted gamma-prime
   microstructures
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB A [h00] oriented Co-based superalloy single crystal was crept under tension at 940 degrees C/100 MPa, resulting in a P-type raft morphology with extensive particle coalescence along the [h00] loading direction. However, particle coalescence was also observed in two perpendicular directions on the (h00) plane, normal to the loading axis. Tensile creep experiments were performed with in-situ neutron diffraction at 800 degrees C/500 MPa on this initially rafted gamma' microstructure, and for comparison at (i) 900 degrees C/260 MPa, and at (ii) 750 degrees C/875 MPa, both with initially cuboidal gamma' microstructures. The alloy was shown to exhibit a positive lattice parameter misfit, and during the first hour of creep at 900 degrees C/260 MPa, the lattice parameter evolution indicated changes in phase composition associated with gamma' dissolution as the alloy achieved phase equilibrium at 900 degrees C. For all three in-situ creep measurements, there was a significant divergence of the gamma' and gamma lattice parameters as creep proceeded. The lattice parameter misfit values between the precipitates and the matrix approached their unconstrained values during creep, and were notably large compared to those of Ni-based superalloys. This is indicative of a loss of coherency at the precipitate/matrix interfaces. Such a loss of coherency at the precipitate/matrix interfaces will likely degrade certain mechanical properties such as fatigue resistance, as has been shown for the Ni-based superalloys.

TI Electrochemical characterisation of novel gamma/gamma '-strengthened
   Co-base superalloys
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB Electrochemical behaviour of a new gamma/gamma'-strengthened Co-base superalloy with the composition Co-9Al-9W-0.12B (in at%) was studied in comparison with pure Co at room temperature in 1 M Na2SO4 (pH 5.9) and 0.1 M NaOH (pH 12.8) aqueous solutions. Pure Co and the Co-base superalloy show passive behaviour in both solutions. Impedance spectra measured at the corrosion potential indicate comparable impedance values for the alloy and pure Co in neutral solution, but in alkaline solution the alloy shows a lower corrosion rate. Polarisation curves indicate a limited range of passivity for both materials in neutral solution. In alkaline solution, the alloy and pure Co show similar (albeit not identical) primary and secondary ranges of passivity, as previously described in the literature for pure Co. Furthermore, lower passive current densities are observed for the superalloy in the primary range of passivity. As the superalloy studied in this work is a promising material for high temperature applications, we moreover compared the corrosion behaviour of oxidised alloy surfaces with the bare alloy surface. For this, isothermal oxidation of the gamma/gamma'-strengthened Co-base superalloy was carried out in air at 800 degrees C and 900 degrees C for 24 h and 500 h. Compared to unoxidised Co-Al-W-B alloys and pure Co samples, the high temperature oxide scales provide orders of magnitude higher protection with good barrier properties in a potential range between -1 and +2V (vs. Ag/AgCl). In general, longer oxidation times and a higher oxidation temperature result in the formation of more protective oxide layers. The protective effect of the high temperature oxide layers is discussed in view of their thickness and chemical composition. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

SO JOM
AB Nickel-based superalloys are complex alloys that contain ten to 15 elements that are widely used in industries where high-temperature strength and corrosion resistance are required. Alloy additions commonly include Cr, Co, W, Ta, Al, P, Re, Mo, and, in some alloys, Ru. Each of these additions can affect the as-cast microstructure due to differences in elemental segregation. A better understanding of the effects of typical additions to nickel-based superalloys on the segregation of the elements in the alloy can help identify potential improvements in the processing of current alloys and the development of new alloys. Therefore, the effects of several common alloying additions on solidification segregation and defects were evaluated. In general, an increase in the degree of elemental segregation was observed with increases in each of the elements listed except cobalt and molybdenum. Increased levels of cobalt and molybdenum resulted in reductions in the segregation of most of the elements in the alloy.

TI A computational high-throughput search for new ternary superalloys
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB In 2006, a novel cobalt-based superalloy was discovered [1] with mechanical properties better than some conventional nickel-based superalloys. As with conventional superalloys, its high performance arises from the precipitate-hardening effect of a coherent L1(2) phase, which is in two-phase equilibrium with the fcc matrix. Inspired by this unexpected discovery of an L1(2) ternary phase, we performed a first principles search through 2224 ternary metallic systems for analogous precipitate-hardening phases of the form X-3[A(0.5),B-0.5], where X = Ni, Co, or Fe, and [A,B] = Li, Be, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn Ga, Sr, Y, Zr, Nb, Mo, Tc, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, Cd, In, Sn, Sb, Hf, Ta, W, Re, Os, Ir, Pt, Au, Hg, or Tl. We found 102 systems that have a smaller decomposition energy and a lower formation enthalpy than the Co-3(Al, W) superalloy. They have a stable two-phase equilibrium with the host matrix within the concentration range 0 < x < 1 (X-3[A(x),B1-x]) and have a relative lattice mismatch with the host matrix of less than or equal to 5%. These new candidates, narrowed from 2224 systems, suggest possible experimental exploration for identifying new superalloys. Of these 102 systems, 37 are new; they have no reported phase diagrams in standard databases. Based on cost, experimental difficulty, and toxicity, we limit these 37 to a shorter list of six promising candidates of immediate interest. Our calculations are consistent with current experimental literature where data exists. (C) 2016 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI In Situ Investigation of the Oxidation of Cobalt-Base Superalloys in the
   Environmental Scanning Electron Microscope
SO ADVANCED ENGINEERING MATERIALS
AB Since their discovery in 2006, cobalt-base superalloys have aroused increasing interest as potential materials for various high-temperature applications. One of the still unsolved problems is their resistance to oxidation. In the present study, the very first stages of the oxidation process of a Co-9Al-9W alloy were investigated. To this aim, the progress of the oxidation process was continuously observed at high magnification in an environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM). Oxidation starts not necessarily at the grain boundaries, and both the onset temperature and the oxidation rate depend on the crystallographic orientation of the crystallites.

AB Five novel Co-30N1-(6 + x)Al-(3-y)W-yMo-1Ta-3.5Ti-12Cr-0.1Hf-0.025 C (x = 0, y = 0, 1, and x = 2, y = 0, 1, 2 at%) multi-component polycrystalline gamma'-strengthened Co-base superalloys are designed to investigate the effects of Al and Mo content on the microstructure and properties in this study. Based on the 6Al3W alloy, the addition of 2 at% Al has the effects of increasing the gamma' solvus temperature, reducing the density, increasing the gamma' volume fraction and coarsening rate, reducing the Vickers hardness but increasing the yield strength at 750 degrees C. The replacement of 1 at% W by 1 at% Mo remarkably reduced the density with a negligible effect on the gamma' coarsening rate; Meanwhile, this slightly reduced the gamma' solvus temperature and volume fraction causing a slight decrease of Vickers hardness and yield strength at 750 degrees C. The experimental alloys all show relatively low density, large processing window, good microstructure stability at 750 degrees C and mechanical properties, especially for 6Al2W1Mo alloy which has density of 8.69 g cm(-3), processing window of 247 degrees C, room-temperature Vickers hardness of 5.1 GPa, stable microstructure without detrimental phase after a heat treatment of 900 degrees C @8 h + 750 degrees C @1000 h. These results may provide guidance for the development of the novel wrought Co-base superalloys with high performance and low density.

TI Tensile properties of Co-based oxide dispersion strengthened superalloys
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Tensile properties of a novel Co-20Cr-5Al-2.4Hf-1.5Y(2)O(3) (wt%) oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) superalloy were studied through a comparing investigation with Co-20Cr-5Al (wt%) alloy. Both the Co-based alloys (with and without oxide particles) were fabricated by mechanical alloying (MA), spark plasma sintering (SPS), hot rolling and the final annealing at 1200 degrees C. Due to the ultrafine grains of 500 nm in the ODS superalloy and 1.2 mu m in the ODS free alloy, the metastable fcc structure predominates at room temperature. Tensile testing was conducted at room temperature and 1000 degrees C. Strain-induced twinning deformation was evidenced by transmission electron microscopy and was found to significantly enhance the ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of the two alloys at room temperature. The Co-based ODS superalloy exhibits a superior tensile strength of 2.85 GPa at room temperature, which is associated with the distribution of twins and fine Y-Hf oxides. At 1000 degrees C, since the ultrafine grain size in the ODS superalloys, an easy grain boundary deformation occurred and resulted in a significant reduction in the UTS value. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI Microstructure evolution of cobalt aluminide coating on nickel-based
   superalloys during exposure at 1050 degrees C
SO VACUUM
AB Cobalt aluminide coating was deposited onto two directionally solidified Ni-based superalloys (DZ 466 and DS GTD111) by low-pressure chemical vapor deposition. Interdiffusion behaviors of the two coating/superalloy systems were examined during long-term thermal exposure at 1050 degrees C. It was observed that the inward diffusion of Al and Co from the coating to the substrate and the outward diffusion of Ni and refractory elements such as W, Ta and Cr etc. from the substrate occurred during annealing. This phenomenon induced the degradation of coating matrix and several precipitations of chromium containing phases. Degradation rate and precipitate categories are of great differences for the two studied superalloys. The initial precipitates presented in the coating system had a morphological heredity-effect (MHE) to the final Upsilon phase microstructure. Mechanism referred to elements distribution was discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Effect of Alloying Elements on Friction and Wear Performance of Novel
   Co-Al-W Superalloys
SO RARE METAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING
AB Novel Co-Al-W superalloy is a novel Co-base superalloy, with the precipitation strengthening by a ternary compound gamma'-Co-3(Al,W) phase on gamma-Co matrix. The effect of alloying element Mo, Nb, Ta and Ti on friction and wear performance of Co-Al-W superalloys at room temperature was studied by THT07-135 type friction and wear tester and SEM, and cobalt-based Stellite 6 alloy was employed for comparison. Results show that the friction coefficient of 9.8W superalloy is smaller than that of cobalt-based Stellite 6. Alloying elements Mo, Nb and Ti can moderately reduce wear mass loss and friction coefficient of 9.8W superalloy, and improve the wear resistance. The Mo, Ti and Nb elements can clearly improve the wear resistance of 9.8W superalloy while the effect of Ta element is not obvious. The wear mechanism of Co-Al-W superalloy is mainly oxidation and abrasive wear, while that of Stellite 6 alloy mainly is delamination and abrasive wear.

TI Effects of alloying elements on the structural, elastic and

   calculations
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB In this work, we investigated the effects of alloying elements X (X = Al, Ti, V, Nb, Mo and W) on the structural stability, elastic, electronic and thermodynamic properties of Co3Ta compounds using the density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The investigations of atomic structure reveal that all of the alloying elements prefer to occupy Co sites rather than Ta sites in both the L1(2) and D0(19) structures, by which Mo is found to play the most effective role in the structural stabilization for gamma' phase. Both bulk moduli and shear moduli of Co3Ta compounds are reduced by the additions of alloying elements, except that the shear moduli are slightly increased by alloying Mo and W. By using the quasi-harmonic Debye model, the thermodynamic properties, including thermal expansion coefficients, heat capacity and bulk modulus, are predicted as a function of temperature for these compounds. The results from this work provide fundamental information for the further development of Co-Ta-based superalloys. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The effect of Co on the as-cast and heat-treated microstructures was investigated in two experimental Ni-based single-crystal superalloys containing low levels of Re and Ru. The experimental results indicated that increasing the Co content from 7.9 to 15.8 wt pct decreased the volume fraction of (gamma + gamma') eutectic and the solidification segregation ratio of W. High levels of Co additions were also found to decrease the solvus temperatures of the gamma' phase and (gamma + gamma') eutectic as well as the solidus temperature. During the long-term thermal exposure at 1373 K (1100 A degrees C), no TCP phases precipitated in either alloy. However, the coarsening and coalescence of gamma' precipitates in the alloy containing 15.8 wt pct Co was slower than that in the other alloy with 7.9 wt pct Co. In the current study, high levels of Co additions decreased the equilibrium volume fraction of gamma' phase, leading to a change in the partitioning ratios of TCP-forming elements Cr, Mo, Re, and W between the gamma and gamma' phases. This change resulted in a lower degree of elemental supersaturation in the gamma matrix and improved the phase stability of the gamma/gamma' microstructure. These experimental results were then compared with those obtained from multi-component thermodynamic calculations, and good agreement was observed.

SO CORROSION SCIENCE
AB Isothermal oxidation was carried out on gamma'-strengthened Co-Al-W-B-Ni and Co-Al-W-B-Si superalloys at 800, 900, and 1000 degrees C. Ni-addition to Co-Al-W-B alloys leads to an absence of B within the inner oxide layer and at the grain boundaries, as indicated by ToF-SIMS. As a result, also inner Al2O3-formation is inhibited, which leads to inferior oxidation properties compared to Ni-free alloys. In contrast, Si-addition enhances formation of protective Al2O3 at 900 and 1000 degrees C due to enhanced selective Al-oxidation. Si-containing phases at the oxide/alloy interface, at the grain boundaries, and within precipitates are of subordinate importance but may further improve oxidation resistance. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

SO JOURNAL OF CRYSTAL GROWTH
AB Corrosion of process equipment during ammonothermal synthesis at high temperature and pressure is still one of the big limitations of this process because of reduced crystal quality and safety issues. In this paper we present preliminary ammonothermal corrosion experiments with two Ni-base superalloys (Inconel (R) Alloy 718 and Haynes (R) 282 (R) Alloy) and two newly developed Co-base superalloys (CoWAlloy1&2) in a supercritical NH3/NH4Cl-solution (24 h/550 degrees C/105 MPa). After the experiment, the samples were analyzed by their mass change per initial surface area (specific weight change). Additionally, the morphological and elemental changes of the corrosion layers were evaluated. None of the investigated alloys developed a passivation layer and the corrosion layers were very fragile. In agreement with previous studies, the Ni-base alloys showed intergranular attack with severe general corrosive degeneration. Despite their high potential for high-pressure at high-temperature applications and in contrast to a ternary Co-Al-W-alloy, the investigated multinary Co-base alloys were strongly attacked, too. However, CoWAlloy2 presented the lowest specific weight change of the investigated alloys. Thus, it shows the best potential for application in acidic environment of the investigated alloys. Additionally, CoWAlloy2 proved good stability in a supercritical NH3/Na-solution (24 h/550 degrees C/93 MPa).

AB An Ni-Al-Co system embedded-atom-method potential is constructed for the gamma(Ni)/gamma' (Ni3Al) superalloy based on experiments and first-principles calculations. The stacking fault energies (SFEs) of the Ni(Co, Al) random solid solutions are calculated as a function of the concentrations of Co and Al. The calculated SFEs decrease with increasing concentrations of Co and Al, which is consistent with the experimental results. The embedding energy term in the present potential has an important influence on the SFEs of the random solid solutions. The cross-slip processes of a screw dislocation in homogenous Ni(Co) solid solutions are simulated using the present potential and the nudged elastic band method. The cross-slip activation energies increase with increasing Co concentration, which implies that the creep resistance of gamma(Ni) may be improved by the addition of Co.

TI Shearing of gamma ' particles in Co-base and Co-Ni-base superalloys
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB Shearing mechanisms of the primary strengthening phase in cobalt-base and cobalt-nickel-base super-alloys, gamma' (L1(2)), are investigated at the elementary defect level by using a combination of generalized-stacking-fault energy (GSF) calculations and phase field simulations. The GSF energy surfaces of the gamma and gamma' phases, as determined from available experimental data and ab initio calculations, are used in the phase field simulations. Sophisticated deformation pathways leading to various planar defects including antiphase boundaries (APB), remnant superlattice intrinsic stacking faults (SISF), APB-SISF-APB ribbons and SISF islands are predicted as a function of alloy composition and particle shapes. The predicted stacking fault configurations for both alloys are consistent with recent transmission electron microscopy observations. Effects of dislocation line tension difference in gamma and gamma' phases and planar defect energy variation due to segregation at the planar defects are discussed. The detailed dislocation core structures, effects of dislocation line tension differences on deformation mechanisms, and unique deformation mechanisms uncovered, which include stacking fault ribbon shearing, antiphase boundary shearing, and mixed modes, could be used to improve constitutive microstructure-property relationships in advanced crystal plasticity modeling and to assist in alloy design.

TI Thermal expansion behavior of new Co-based alloys and implications for

SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB The thermal expansion behavior of five gamma'-(L1(2)) containing Co-based superalloys was measured using push-rod dilatometry. These results were analyzed to determine the mean coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), the instantaneous CTE, and gamma'-solvus temperature of the alloys. The CTE was found to depend strongly on the gamma'-solvus temperature.
   In turbine applications, these alloys will be part of a multilayer system that generates thermal stresses due to the CTE mismatch between the components. To investigate this phenomenon, the CTE data was incorporated into a thermo-mechanical model to calculate the energy release rate (ERR) for the delamination of coatings from these alloys. The ERR of a thermally grown oxide (TGO) formed on the bare and bond coated Co-based alloys was determined as a function of superalloy and bond coat CTE. The ERR of a thermal barrier coating (TBC) was evaluated as a function of temperature, superalloy LIE, and coating thickness. The ERR was found to be about 1.5 x greater in Co-based superalloys compared to Ni-based superalloys cooled from T = 1100 degrees C to ambient.

TI THE ROLE OF Ti ON REDUCING THE MISFIT OF A Co-Al-W ALLOY
SO TMS 2014 SUPPLEMENTAL PROCEEDINGS
CT 143rd TMS Annual Meeting & Exhibition
CY FEB 16-20, 2014
CL San Diego, CA
AB The role of Ti on a new Co-based gamma/gamma' two phase superalloy was investigated. Scanning Electron Microscopy(SEM), X-ray Diffraction(XRD) were employed to study the microstructure of alloys with various Ti contents. The volume of gamma' rise steadily with the increase of Ti content, and the morphology switched from fine rod-like to regular cubical when the Ti concentration is over 6%. The addition of Ti reduced the misfit between gamma/gamma' phase, the misfit of the alloy with 8% Ti was only 0.15%. The room temperature hardness was improved with the increase of Ti content, which peaked when the Ti content is 8%, then dropped. The results indicated that Ti is an key element in the alloying development of Co-Al-W based superalloys.

TI Effects of titanium substitutions for aluminum and tungsten in
   Co-10Ni-9Al-9W (at%) superalloys
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB Polycrystalline Co-10Ni-(9 - x)Al-(9 - x)W-2xTi at% (x = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4) alloys with gamma(f.c.c.) plus gamma'(L1(2)) microstructures are investigated, where the gamma'(L1(2))-formers Al and W are replaced with Ti. Upon aging, the initially cuboidal gamma'(L1(2))-precipitates grow and develop a rounded morphology. After 256 h of aging at 1000 degrees C, the precipitates in the 6 and 8 at% Ti alloys coalesce and develop an irregular, elongated morphology. After 1000 h of aging, replacement of W and Al with Ti increases both the mean radius, < R >, and volume fraction, phi, of the gamma'(L1(2))-phase from < R > = 463 nm and phi = 8% for 2 at% Ti to < R > = 722 nm and phi = 52% for 8 at% Ti. Composition measurements of the gamma(f.c.c.)-matrix and gamma'(L1(2))-precipitates demonstrate that Ti substitutes for W and Al in the gamma'(L1(2))-precipitates, increases the partitioning of W to gamma'(L1(2)), and changes the partitioning behavior of Al from a mild gamma'(L1(2))-former to a mild gamma(f.c.c.)-former. The grain boundaries in the aged alloys exhibit W-rich precipitates, most likely mu(Co7W6)-type, which do not destabilize the gamma(f.c.c.) plus gamma'(L1(2)) microstructure within the grains. Four important benefits accrue from replacing W and Al with Ti: (i) the alloys' mass density decrease; (ii) the gamma'(L1(2))-solvus temperature increases; (iii) the gamma'(L1(2)) volume fraction formed during aging at 1273 K (1000 degrees C) increases; and (iv) the 0.2% offset flow stress increases.

TI Influence of composition on microstructural parameters of single crystal
   nickel-base superalloys
SO MATERIALS CHARACTERIZATION
AB Fourteen nickel-base superalloy single crystals containing a range of chromium (Cr), cobalt (Co), molybdenum (Mo), and rhenium (Re) levels, and fixed amounts of aluminum (Al) and tantalum (Ta), were examined to determine the effect of bulk composition on basic microstructural parameters, including gamma' solvus, gamma' volume fraction, topologically close-packed (TCP) phases, gamma and gamma' phase chemistries, and gamma-gamma' lattice mismatch. Regression models describing the influence of bulk alloy composition on each of the microstructural parameters were developed and compared to predictions by a commercially-available software tool that used computational thermodynamics Co produced the largest change in gamma' solvus over the wide compositional range explored and Mo produced the biggest effect on the gamma lattice parameter over its range, although Re had a very potent influence on all naicrostructural parameters investigated. Changing the Cr, Co, Mo, and Re contents in the bulk alloy had an impact on their concentrations in they gamma matrix and to a smaller extent in the gamma' phase. The software tool under-predicted gamma' solvus temperatures and gamma' volume fractions, and over-predicted TCP phase volume fractions at 982 degrees C. However, the statistical regression models provided excellent estimations of the microstructural parameters and demonstrated the usefulness of such fummlas. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

   phase equilibria in the Co-Ni-Ta system
SO INTERMETALLICS
AB The crystal structure of Co3Ta was identified to be of the BaPb3 type having hexagonal R (3) over barm symmetry and Pearson symbol hR36 on the basis of X-ray diffraction data. The solidification process of the as-cast Co-Ni-Ta alloys and phase equilibria at 1473 K of the annealed Co-Ni-Ta alloys were studied by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and differential thermal analysis (DTA) techniques. The liquidus surface projection and isothermal section at 1473 K of the Co-Ni-Ta system were first established. The liquidus surface projection consisted of 11 primary solidification regions and 9 ternary invariant reactions, and the isothermal section at 1473 K was made up of 8 three-phase regions and 17 two-phase regions. The addition of nickel can stabilize Co3Ta such that the peritectic temperature is at least 1594 K in the Co-Ni-Ta system, which is higher than the peritectoid one at 1306 K in the Co-Ta system. The present experimental results could be used as guidance to cobalt-based superalloys and offer potential candidates for cobalt/nickel intermetallic compounds.

AB The carbides reinforcing cast superalloys are the most often chromium carbides or tantalum carbides (TaC), the second ones being preferred for very high temperature. In this work, three chromium-rich alloys based on Fe, Ni and Co, containing either TaC carbides in unusually high quantity, or unusual HfC carbides were cast and subjected to 3-points bending tests at 1200 degrees C under constant load in order to specify and compare their creep behavior under 20 MPa. The best alloy in this field appeared to be the cobalt-based one reinforced with interdendritic eutectic HfC carbides. After comparison with a Co-25Cr-0.5C-7.5Ta alloy, known for its high strength at 1200 degrees C, this alloy confirmed its great interest for uses at elevated temperature under flexural or tensile stress.

CY NOV 20, 2002
CL London, ENGLAND
SP Inst Mat
AB A new method for diffusion bonding nickel base and cobalt base superalloys has been developed, which is based on non-chemical oxide removal before the bonding process. Using this method, diffusion bonds were produced in nickel base and cobalt base superalloys with 'virtually invisible' bond interfaces and compositions very close to the bulk alloys. The bonding time required is about 1 h and the results of severe mechanical tests of the bonded samples, including directionally solidified (DS), single crystal and dissimilar superalloys, are very promising. The new oxide removal method is very rapid, does not require the use of any sophisticated equipment and is not a costly process. The high temperature properties of bonded samples are currently being investigated. European and USA patents have been applied for and the details of this new method are to be published in the future.

TI Temporal evolution of a model Co-Al-W superalloy aged at 650 degrees C
   and 750 degrees C
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB The temporal evolution of a gamma(f.c.c.)/gamma' (L1(2)) Co-8.8Al-73 W superalloy aged at 650 degrees C (10 min-4096 h) and 750 degrees C (10 min-256 h) is studied utilizing atom-probe tomography (APT), scanning electron microscopy, and Vickers microhardness testing. The evolution of the phase compositions, gamma' (L1(2)) volume fraction, and mean precipitate radius, <R2-D(t)>, are determined. Coarsening rate constants and temporal exponents are calculated for <R-D(t)> of the gamma' (L1(2))-nanoprecipitates. The temporal exponents are found to be generally close to 1/p = 1/3 as required for diffusion-limited coarsening. Tungsten solid-solubility is significantly reduced in the gamma(f.c.c.)-matrix at 650 degrees C (0.54 +/- 0.04 at. %) and 750 degrees C (1.35 +/- 0.06 at. %) when compared with aging at 900 degrees C (5.5 at. %). The value of <R-2D(t)> of the gamma' (L1(2))-nanoprecipitates increases with increasing aging time corresponding to an increase in the Vickers microhardness; the peak strength was not, however, achieved for the aging times investigated. The morphology of the gamma' (L1(2))-nanoprecipitates begins as spheroids but transitions to cuboids at longer aging times, with final the gamma' (L1(2)) volume fractions for aging at 650 degrees C and 750 degrees C being phi = 53% and 54%, respectively. The effect of quench-rate (either furnace-cooled, air-cooled, oil quenched, or water quenched) from a supersolvus temperature of 1050 degrees C on the microstructure of the alloy is also investigated. Slow cooling (furnace and air-cooling) is shown to result in a uniform distribution of nanometer sized gamma' (L1(2))-nanoprecipitates, unlike Ni-based superalloys in which the gamma' (L1(2))-nanoprecipitates form in a non-uniform or multimodal distribution.

TI Coarsening kinetics of gamma ' precipitates in cobalt-base alloys
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB The expeditious development of novel cobalt-base gamma-gamma' alloys as possible next generation superalloys critically depends on achieving a comprehensive understanding of the coarsening kinetics of ordered gamma' precipitates. This paper discusses the coarsening of Ll(2) ordered Co-3(W, Al) precipitates in a model ternary Co-10Al-10W (at.%) alloy during isothermal annealing at 800 and 900 C. The experimentally determined temporal evolution of average size of the gamma' precipitates suggests classical matrix diffusion limited Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner coarsening at both temperatures. The gamma' coarsening rate constants have been determined using a modified coarsening rate equation for non-dilute solutions. Furthermore, using the Cahn Hilliard formulation for interfacial energy, the gamma/gamma' interfacial energies at the respective annealing temperatures have been correlated to the concentration profile across the interface that has been experimentally determined using atom probe tomography. The calculated interfacial energies are in comparable range with those observed in nickel-base superalloys. Additionally, this analysis has permitted, for the first time, the determination of the gradient energy coefficient for gamma/gamma' interfaces in Co-base alloys, a critical input for phase-field and other simulation models for microstructural evolution.

The high melting refractory element Re readily dissolves in Co and thereby changes the character of a Co-based alloy to a high melting point material. So far Co-Re system has not been investigated from the point of view of strengthening and oxidation and therefore different possibilities of strengthening mechanisms have been explored for our alloy development. Cr, a common element for oxidation resistance in many systems, is added along with Si in Co-Re alloys to improve oxidation behaviour at high temperatures.

   MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB In current study, two sets of Ni-based alloys (Ni-Cr-Mo and Ni-Cr-Re series) containing 0 to 15 at. pct of Co addition were investigated to understand the formation behavior of TCP phases. Significant difference on the formation behavior of TCP phases and corresponding Co effect was found in two series alloys. TCP precipitates (P and mu phase) were observed in both grain interiors and boundaries in Ni-Cr-Mo series alloys. Higher levels of Co addition increased the supersaturation of Mo in the gamma matrix, which explained that Co addition promoted mu phase formation. In contrast, the TCP precipitates (sigma phase) formed by the manner of discontinuous precipitation transformation in the grain boundaries in Ni-Cr-Re series alloys. More Co additions suppressed the formation of sigma phase, which was mainly attributed to the decreased supersaturation of Re in thermodynamically metastable gamma matrix. The information obtained from simplified alloy systems in this study is helpful for the design of multicomponent Ni-based superalloys.

SO JOURNAL OF THE JAPAN INSTITUTE OF METALS
AB A second-generation Co-free Ni base single crystal superalloy, TMS-82C (Ni-0Co-4.9Cr-1.0Mo-8.7W-5.3Al-6.0Ta-2.4Re-0.1Hf, in mass%) was derived from its base alloy, TMS-82+ (Ni-7.8Co-4.9Cr-1.9Mo-8.7W-5.3Al-6.0Ta-2.4Re-0.1Hf, in mass%), which had been successfully engine tested. The absent of Co can eliminate the product of isotope Co-60 from radioactive decay, and it can improve the maintainability of the gas turbine engine. However, the removal of Co had decreased the creep strength of TMS-82C. To further improve its creep strength, five additional alloys were designed with the addition of 0.5 mass% Mo, W, Ti, Ta and Re to TMS-82C, respectively. Results indicated that creep properties of all five alloys performed better than that of TMS-82C under 900 degrees C/392 MPa and 1000 degrees C/245 MPa conditions. W-bearing alloy exhibits similar creep property comparing to that of TMS-82+ under the 900 degrees C/392 MPa condition.

SO MATERIALS CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
AB Hafnium is often used to improve the high temperature oxidation resistance of superalloys but not to form carbides for strengthen them against creep. In this work hafnium was added in cobalt-based alloys for verifying that HfC can be obtained in cobalt-based alloys and for characterizing their behavior at a very temperature. Three Co-25Cr-0.25 and 0.50C alloys containing 3.7 and 7.4 Hf to promote HfC carbides, and four Co-25Cr-0 to 1C alloys for comparison (all contents in wt.%), were cast and exposed at 1200 degrees C for 50 h in synthetic air. The HfC carbides formed instead chromium carbides during solidification, in eutectic with matrix and as dispersed compact particles. During the stage at 1200 degrees C the HfC carbides did not significantly evolve, even near the oxidation front despite oxidation early become very fast and generalized. At the same time the chromium carbides present in the Co-Cr-C alloys totally disappeared in the same conditions. Such HfC-alloys potentially bring efficient and sustainable mechanical strengthening at high temperature, but their hot oxidation resistance must be significantly improved. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

SO CANADIAN METALLURGICAL QUARTERLY
AB TaC carbides are among the most efficient particles for reinforcing cast refractory alloys and superalloys against mechanical stresses at temperature as high as 1000 degrees C and over. The most common TaC-strengthened superalloys contain less than 0.5 wt-%C and 5 wt-%Ta. Enriching alloys in C and Ta may lead to higher fractions in TaC and therefore possibly to higher mechanical properties for service in hot conditions. The present work explores the microstructures achievable in a cobalt alloy, a nickel one and an iron one, by the introduction of 1 wt-%C and 15 wt-%Ta, first using thermodynamic calculations and second by real elaboration. High fractions in TaC were effectively obtained, script-like eutectic ones, but also blocky preeutectic ones less efficient for reinforcement. These blocky TaC, the formation of which was explained by thermodynamic calculations, tend to aggregate together in some locations, with an overconsumption of Ta. However, some disagreements were noticed between predictions with thermodynamic calculations and as-cast microstructures.

TI Compressive strain hold effect on high temperature low-cycle fatigue
   crack growth in superalloys
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL
AB Crack growth mechanisms taking into account the oxidation and mean stress effect in nickel- and cobalt-based superalloys were determined by crack growth tests using a strain waveform including compressive strain hold. Cracks were found to propagate on the dendrite boundary in both superalloys. Crack growth rates were increased by increasing the compressive hold time. Oxidation around the crack tip was detected by electron probe micro analysis (EPMA) and was found to accelerate the fatigue crack growth. The oxidation component in the normalized crack growth rate by oxidation is proportional to about the 1/3 power of loading frequency for Ni-based superalloy, whereas the power for Co-based superalloy is about 1/2. Furthermore, mean stresses in the nickel-based superalloy, which has a high proof strength even at high temperature, were increased by the compressive strain hold. It was also found that increasing the mean stress accelerates the crack growth. A crack growth model that considers effects of both oxidation at crack the tip and mean stress was discussed from these test results.

Tension creep tests of single crystal Co-base alloys have been conducted in vacuum at 900 degrees C at stresses between 275 and 379 MPa. Minimum creep rates of these Co-Al-W-base alloys are comparable to commercial Ni-base superalloy Rene N4. Directional coarsening and the formation of W-rich phases are observed during creep. Implications for future design of the Co-base alloys are discussed.

   alloys with x varying from 0 to 50 wt%
SO CALPHAD-COMPUTER COUPLING OF PHASE DIAGRAMS AND THERMOCHEMISTRY
AB Involving a particularly strong carbide-former metallic element, the tantalum carbides are potentially very stable at elevated temperatures in term of volume fraction and morphology. The TaC phase represents a major strengthening way to allow cast chromium-rich superalloys resisting mechanical stresses at elevated temperatures. They are exploited in recent high performance cobalt-based superalloys but seemingly not in nickelchromium refractory alloys. Earlier studies showed that the stability of TaC in Ni-Cr alloys is not so good as in the Co-Cr ones, and they evidenced that chromium carbides may compete with TaC in the formation of the carbides population. A possible way to optimize the presence of TaC in Ni-Cr alloy may consist in rating the chromium content to an ideal value but preliminary knowledge about the TaC dependence on the Cr content is compulsory. The aim of this work is precisely the investigation of the effect of the content in chromium on the appearance and stability of the TaC phase in Ni-Cr alloys, by the means of thermodynamic calculations and real experiments in parallel. A global system Ni(bal.)-xCr-0.4C-6Ta compositions (with x varying from 0 to 50 wt%) was chosen. Thermodynamic calculations were performed to know the theoretic metallurgical states inside the considered x range. These theoretic results being dependent on the suitability of the used database, real experiments of verifications were also carried out for a selection of six alloys (x = 0, 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 wt%). The alloys prepared by respecting these compositions were cast and isothermally exposed at high temperature (1400 and 1510 K), then subjected to metallographic characterization. For the used database the calculated results showed that no TaC should never appear whatever their Cr content, while TaC were really observed in the as-cast and aged versions of the alloys containing 20 wt%Cr and more, but never alone since chromium carbides were systematically also present. When the Cr content in the alloy is too low, the TaC are rare or even no present. This allowed concluding first that the database used for the calculations needs serious improvements, followed by tests with, as first criteria of quality, a good correspondence with the present experimental results. Second, the presence of Cr in quantity high enough is surprisingly compulsory to obtain TaC carbides in quantity high enough, but it is no possible to avoid the appearance of chromium carbides. Obviously, other ways than Cr adjustments must be found to obtain TaC in nickel-based alloys as the single carbide phase and in quantity high enough to achieve high mechanical properties at high temperature.

TI Experimental Determination and Thermodynamic Assessment of Phase
   Equilibria in the Co-Mo System
SO MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS
AB Phase equilibria of the solid phases including the magnetic and martensitic transformation temperatures in the Co-Mo system were investigated using two-phase alloys, the diffusion couple technique, differential scanning calorimetry, and vibrating sample magnetometry. Furthermore, ab initio calculations of D0(19)-Co3Mo and several fcc-base ordered structures, including metastable compounds, were carried out to estimate the formation energy. Based on these results, a thermodynamic assessment using the CALPHAD method was performed. A four-sublattice model was used for the fcc-base phase to describe the order-disorder phase transformation. For the mu phase, both a three and a four-sublattice model were applied. The set of thermodynamic values describing the Gibbs energy of the Co-Mo system reproduces the experimental phase diagram well. The four-sublattice model for the mu phase reproduces the site fractions as well as the phase boundaries better than the three-sublattice model. The calculated metastable fcc-base phase diagram considering chemical and magnetic ordering is also reasonable. This is important for estimating the phase stability of the L1(2) phase in Co-base gamma/gamma' superalloys. [doi:10.2320/matertrans.M2012149]

TI Effect of Mo on microstructural characteristics and coarsening kinetics
   of gamma' precipitates in Co-Al-W-Ta-Ti alloys
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB The solvus temperature, volume fraction, coarsening behavior of gamma' precipitates and the partitioning behavior of alloying elements as well as lattice misfit of gamma/gamma' phases influence the creep behavior of Ni and Co-base superalloys. However, few investigations about the microstructural characteristics and the coarsening behavior of gamma' precipitates were reported in multicomponent novel Co-base superalloys during thermal exposure. Two alloys containing different contents of molybdenum and tungsten have been investigated to explore the effect of molybdenum on gamma' solvus temperature, gamma+gamma' microstructure and gamma' coarsening in Co-Al-W-Ta-Ti-base alloys. The results showed that the gamma' solvus temperature decreases with the addition of Mo. Mo addition reduces the gamma' volume fractions after aging above 1000 degrees C, but results in negligible influence on the gamma' volume fractions aging at 900 degrees C. Meanwhile, gamma' coarsening is controlled by diffusion in experimental alloys after aging at 900 degrees C and 1000 degrees C, and the kinetics of gamma' growth in experimental alloys are consistent with the predictions of LSW theory.

TI Mechanical Properties of Cast & Wrought Pancakes Using New Ni-Co Base
   Disk Superalloys
SO JOURNAL OF THE JAPAN INSTITUTE OF METALS
AB New kinds of cast and wrought (C & W) Ni-Co base superalloys (TMW alloys) have been developed based on the innovative concept of combining two kinds of gamma-gamma' two phase alloys, Ni-base and Co-base alloys, for the applications of turbine disks and high pressure compressor blades. The results based on testing 20 kg ingots indicate that TMW alloys show excellent high temperature strength and formability, may provide 50 degrees C temperature advantage in 630 MPa/100 h creep performance over C & W alloy U720Li.
   In this paper, we report our new results on the full scale pancakes manufactured through the C & W process for real components. The results indicate that TMW alloys had good process ability in the ingot making and forging into disk pancakes. Pancake disks with fine grain size of about 10 mu m were successfully obtained for TMW alloys. TMW alloys provide 58 degrees C to 76 degrees C temperature advantages in 0.2% creep strain life under the 630 MPa condition, over alloy U720Li.

TI Elemental partitioning and mechanical properties of Ti- and
   Ta-containing Co-Al-W-base superalloys studied by atom probe tomography
   and nanoindentation
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB Elemental partitioning and hardness in Ti- and Ta-containing Co-base superalloys, strengthened by gamma'-Co-3(Al, W) precipitates, have been studied by local measurements. Using atom probe tomography, we detect strong partitioning of W (partitioning coefficients from 2.4 to 3.4) and only slight partitioning of Al (partitioning coefficients <= 1.1) to the gamma'-Co-3(Al, W) phase. Al segregates to the gamma/gamma' phase boundaries, whereas W is depleted at the gamma side of the boundaries after aging at 900 degrees C and slow air cooling. This kind of Al segregation and W depletion is much less pronounced when water quenching is applied. As a result, these effects are considered to be absent at high temperatures and therefore should not influence the creep properties. Ti and Ta additions are found to strongly partition to the gamma' phase and greatly increase the gamma' volume fraction. Our results indicate that the alloying elements Al, W, Ti and Ta all occupy the B sublattice of the A(3)B structure (L1(2) type) and affect the partitioning behavior of each other. Nanoindentation measurements show that Ta also increases the hardness of the gamma' phase, while the hardness of the gamma channels remains nearly constant in all alloys. The change in hardness of the gamma' phase can be ascribed to the substitution of Al and W atoms by Ti and/or Ta. (C) 2014 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Effect of heat treatment conditions on microstructures of new Ni-Co
   based superalloys for turbine disks
SO JOURNAL OF THE JAPAN INSTITUTE OF METALS
AB New Ni-Co based superalloys (TMW alloys) for gas turbine disks have been recently developed. These new alloys are designed to have higher temperature capability than that of U720Li disk alloy by 50 degrees C. The concept behind alloy design is to combine two kinds of gamma-gamma' structure alloys, U720Li (Ni-Ni3Al) and Co-Ti (CO-CO3Ti) alloys. In this article, we describe the effect of solution heat-treatment conditions on the microstructures of TMW disk alloys (TMW1, 2, 4, and 2 + 4Co), such as the grain size and volume fraction of the primary gamma' phases and the hardness. Microstructural observation results showed that the average grain size and volume fraction of the primary gamma' phases are strongly influenced by the solution temperatures. For each TMW alloy, we identified the relationship among the solution temperature, volume fraction of the primary gamma' phases, and grain size that is necessary to achieve optimum properties. Vickers hardness testing results showed that the addition of a Co-Ti alloy has a positive effect on alloy strengthening at room and elevated temperatures. These results can help determine the optimum heat-treatment condition.

TI A two-stage predicting model for gamma ' solvus temperature of
   L1(2)-strengthened Co-base superalloys based on machine learning
SO INTERMETALLICS
AB As one of the candidate materials of the next generation aircraft engines, L1(2)-strengthened Co-base superalloys have drawn lots of attentions. However, Co-base superalloys have some disadvantages, such as gamma ' precipitates in the superalloys are metastable. Moreover, improving this superalloy through traditional experimental approaches is extremely costly and inefficient. Thus, it is necessary to develop a new approach that could make rapid and accurate predictions of the properties of the L1(2)-strengthened Co-base superalloys. In this study, the gamma ' solvus temperature, which is the basic property of L1(2)-strengthened Co-base superalloys, is predicted based on our two-stage approach. Firstly, the existence of the gamma ' precipitates are predicted. And then, the solvus temperatures of the candidates which are predicted to have gamma ' precipitates are calculated by our models. A new superalloy with high gamma ' precipitates solvus temperature is designed successfully with the help of our approach. The time cost of this approach is less than that of the traditional experimental approach. This approach could also be used to discover L1(2)-strengthened Co-base superalloys with other desired properties.

   mechanism in a single crystal CoNi-base superalloy
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES

AB The thermal stability and high-temperature strength of single crystal CoNi-base superalloys, Co-30Ni-10Al-7W (at%) and Co-30Ni-10Al-7W-2Ta-3Ti (at%), containing gamma'(L1(2)) phase have been investigated. The investigated CoNi-base superalloy with alloying additions of Ti and Ta exhibits excellent gamma' solves temperature, 1236 degrees C, and high-temperature strength, 622 MPa at 900 degrees C, compared to reported gamma'-strengthening Co-base superalloys. Detailed analyses of the deformation mechanisms for the investigated alloys were carried out by using the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterization. Two different transitions of deformation mechanisms for the gamma' phase, from superpartial dislocation shearing to dislocation bypassing and to stacking fault shear, occurred in the investigated alloys as the deformation temperature increased above the peak temperatures. Meanwhile, the high-temperature strength of the investigated alloys largely decreased as the transitions of deformation mechanism took place. The influence of alloying effects on energies of faults and the relationship between high-temperature strength and deformation mechanisms were discussed.

TI Diffusion of solutes in fcc Cobalt investigated by diffusion couples and
   first principles kinetic Monte Carlo
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB The interdiffusivity of Al and the transition metal solutes Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Nb, Mo, Ru, Ta, W, and Re in fcc Co is characterized at 1373 K, 1473 K and 1573 K by binary diffusion couples. The experimental results are complemented by first-principles calculations in combination with kinetic Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the diffusion of Re, W, Mo and Ta in fcc Co. The interdiffusion coefficients of alloying elements in fcc Co are generally smaller than in fcc Ni, but the correlation between interdiffusion coefficients and the atomic number of metal solutes is comparable in Co and Ni. With increasing atomic number and decreasing atomic radii the interdiffusion coefficients of the investigated elements, except for Mn and Fe, decrease strongly. The trends in the diffusivity determined by experiment and simulation are in excellent agreement. Re is the slowest diffusing element in fcc Co among the investigated elements. The electronic structure calculations indicate that this is caused by strong directional bonds between Re and neigh-boring Co atoms. The overall lower diffusivity of solute atoms in Co as compared to Ni suggests that diffusion controlled processes could be slower in Co-base superalloys. (C) 2016 Acta Materialia Inc.

SO PHYSICS OF METALS AND METALLOGRAPHY
AB In this article, we give a preferential regime of selective laser melting for the production of parts from a cobalt superalloy using a PTK-PS domestic machine, which can find application upon the production of components from various superalloys in the aviation and atomic industry and in the automobile industry. We have investigated the phase composition and determined the physicomechanical properties of the samples prepared under the preferential regime of selective laser melting. It has been established that the structure of the alloy obtained by selective laser melting consists of two supersaturated solid solutions based on the low-temperature hexagonal and high-temperature cubic cobalt modifications, which leads to an increase in the strength characteristics of the samples in comparison with the cast samples.

TI Comparative evaluation of hot corrosion resistance of nanostructured
   AlCrN and TiAlN coatings on cobalt-based superalloys
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS RESEARCH
AB Molten vanadate-induced hot corrosion is the major cause of failure of superalloys which are generally used at higher temperatures (such as in internal combustion engines, gas turbines, high temperature tooling and dies, and petrochemical industries and marines). This effect can be minimized by applying thermally stable coatings over the superalloy. In this aspect, the current work investigates the effect of nanostructured aluminum chromium nitride (AlCrN) and titanium aluminum nitride (TiAlN) coatings on the hot corrosion behavior of Co-based superalloy, Superco-605, in an aggressive environment of Na2SO4-60% V2O5 (ratio by weight) at 700 degrees C up to 80 cycles. Each cycle consisted of 1 h heating at 700 degrees C followed by 20 min cooling in an ambient temperature. Hot corrosion kinetics was studied using the thermogravimetric technique and found to follow the parabolic rate law. The corrosion surface morphology and phases formed during hot corrosion were studied using field emission scanning electron microscopy equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction techniques. It was found that AlCrN coating had a better hot corrosion resistance than TiAlN coating.

SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Insight in phase equilibria is very valuable for the design of Co-based superalloys that have the potential of 50 degrees C higher temperature capability than Ni-based superalloys. The Co-rich part of the Co-Al-X (X = W, Mo, Nb, Ni, Ta) ternary systems is especially important and was thus investigated using two sets of diffusion multiples (Ni-Co-CoAl-Cr-Mo-Nb-Ta-Wand Ni-Co-NiAl-Si-Zr). Isothermal sections of the Co-Al-W and Co-Al-Nb systems at 900 degrees C as well as the Co-Al-Mo, Co-Al-Ni and Co-Al-Ta systems at both 900 degrees C and 800 degrees C were constructed from the results of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electron probe microanalysis (EPMA). The data can be used as experimental input to future thermodynamic assessments of the Co-Al-X ternary systems in order to improve the relevant thermodynamic databases for the design and development of Co-based superalloys.

TI Diffusion of refractory elements in Ni-X-Y (X, Y : Co, Re, Ru, W)
   ternary alloys
SO DIFFUSION IN SOLIDS AND LIQUIDS III
SE Defect and Diffusion Forum
CT 3rd International Conference on Diffusion in Solids and Liquids

CL Algarve, PORTUGAL
AB Ni-based superalloys are strengthed by refractory elements such as Re, Ru and W [1]. Thus, the information on the interdiffusion coefficient as well as the thermodynamic interaction between the refractory elements is important for the future alloy design. In this study, interdiffusion coefficients of the refractory elements in Ni-X-Y (X, Y=Co, Re, Ru, W) ternary systems were estimated by a series of experiments.
   In the all systems studied in the present works, the main interdiffusion coefficients were much larger than the cross interdiffusion coefficients. In some systems, two cross interdiffuion coefficients had opposite signs each other. For example, in Ni-Co-Ru system, the main interdiffusion coefficients are (D) over tilde (Ru)(CoCo) = 2.7 x 10(-14) and (D) over tilde (Ru)(RuRu) = 6.8 x 10(-15) , while the cross interdiffusion coefficients are (D) over tilde (Ru)(CoRu) = -6.6 x 10(-16) and (D) over tilde (Ru)(RuCo) = 8.9 x 10(-16) at 1523K.
   In Ni-Co-Ru and Ni-Re-Co systems, the activation energies and frequency factors for two main interdiffusion coefficients. For example, Q(Co) = 268(kJ), D-0(Co) = 4.4 x 10(-5) (m(2) s(-1)), D-0(Ru) = 2.9 x 10(-3)(m(2) s(-1)) in Ni-Co-Ru system.

TI Thermodynamics of cobalt aluminate formation in molten cobalt
SO STEEL RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL
AB The oxygen concentration of liquid cobalt in equilibrium with cobalt aluminate and alumina was measured by suction sampling at temperatures in the range of 1783 to 1873 K. Experiments were made with cobalt of high and low initial oxygen content and with the addition of cobalt aluminate. The Gibbs free energy of the formation of cobalt aluminate in equilibrium with cobalt containing dissolved oxygen and alumina is:
   Co (I) + (1 +x) Al2O3 + [O](1) (wt% in Co) = CoO.(1 +x)Al2O3 with &UDelta; G(0) = -(226400 &PLUSMN; 8730) + (93.04 &PLUSMN; 4.74) T [J/mol].
   The oxygen partial pressure in equilibrium with the dissolved oxygen in molten cobalt was determined by zirconia stabilized with magnesia oxygen sensors. The Gibbs standard free energy of dissolution of oxygen in molten cobalt in the range of 1783 to 1873 K is:
   1/2 O-2 = [O](1) (wt% in Co) with &UDelta; G(0) = -76410 - 2.16 T [J/g(.)atom].

TI Creep properties beyond 1100 degrees C and microstructure of Co-Re-Cr
   alloys
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB The melting point of a novel Co-17Re-23Cr alloy (numbers given in at.%) could be increased by 250 C as compared to established Ni-based superalloys, by optimising the content of Re. Samples were produced by vacuum arc-melting in order to evaluate the creep behaviour at temperatures beyond 1100 degrees C and for microstructural analysis. Three alloys (the Co-17Re-23Cr-based material, and the carbide strengthened alloys Co-17Re-23Cr-2.6C and Co-17Re-23Cr-2.6C-1.2Ta) were investigated. Creep properties, especially the minimum creep rate and the Larson-Miller plots, were compared. The Co-17Re-23Cr-2.6C-1.2Ta alloy has a higher minimum creep rate than Co-17Re-23Cr at 1200 degrees C but it has a lower minimum creep rate than Co-17Re-23Cr at 1100 degrees C. TaC coarsening, detected via transmission electron microscope (TEM) measurements may explain this effect. The overall creep behaviour of Co-17Re-23Cr-2.6C at 1200 degrees C is better than that of Co-17Re-23Cr-2.6C-1.2Ta, but worse than that of Co-17Re-23Cr.
   Microstructural investigations by scanning electron microscopy and TEM reveal a hexagonal closed-packed (hcp) matrix and sigma-phases. The microhardness of the sigma-phase was about 1570 HV (load: 1 g) and around 800 HV for the matrix. Pores and cracks occur along the brittle sigma-phases and grain boundaries in the Co-Re-Cr alloys. A Norton exponent n in between 1.4 and 3.0 points to grain boundary dominated creep mechanisms. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Novel Co-Ti-V-base superalloys reinforced by L1(2)-ordered gamma' phase
SO INTERMETALLICS
AB The influences of alloying elements Al and Ni to a Co-Ti-V master alloy on microstructures, phase stabilities and high-temperature mechanical properties have been investigated. A two-phase microstructure gamma/gamma' with ultrahigh gamma' volume fraction was designed in the Co-Ti-V (master alloy), Co-Ti-V-Al (Al-modified) and Co-Ti-V-Ni (Ni-modified) alloys. Al shows a slight tendency to partition into gamma', while Ni exhibits almost equal distribution between the gamma and gamma' phases. Al is found to increase the volume fraction and solvus temperature of gamma'. The solvus temperatures of gamma' in the master alloy, Al-modified and Ni-modified alloys exceed that of Co-9Al-9W alloy (1000 degrees C) by 91, 112 and 82 degrees C, respectively. The flow stresses of the designed alloys exhibit an anomalous positive dependence on temperature rising from 600 to 750 degrees C. The strengths of the master alloy and Ni-modified alloys are not only higher than that of traditional Co-base superalloy MAR-M 302 at the temperature ranging from 700 to 1000 degrees C, but also comparable with that of the commercial Ni-base superalloy IN-939 between 850 and 1000 degrees C. In conclusion, the present Co-Ti-V-base alloys reinforced by gamma' are suggested as potential candidates for high-temperature utilizations.

AB The phase equilibrium and the precipitation behavior of the gamma' phase in the Co-Al-W-Ni-Cr superalloys were studied by thermodynamic method. The phase equilibrium of the Co-Al-W-15Ni-5Cr alloy at 900 degrees C was calculated, and it was found that there were a gamma' single-phase region and a gamma+gamma' two-phase region. The effects of Al/W ratio on the precipitation of the gamma' phase were studied, and it was clear that higher mole fraction of the gamma' phase can be obtained with the Al/W ratio of 2.5. The stability of the gamma' phase can be improved by adding of Ni, as well as the servicing temperature of the Co-Al-W based superalloys. The results obtained in this work can be used for the developing of the new-type Co-based superalloys.

TI Phase constituents and compressive yield stress of Ni-Co base alloys
SO MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS
AB Phase constituents and compressive yield stress of Ni-Co base alloys have been investigated. The results showed that two-phases of gamma and gamma' were the main constituents in all the alloys. Ni3Ti-type (eta) phase was observed in the alloys with lower Co and Ti content (alloy20); while a new intermetallic (Ni,Co,Cr)(3)(Ti,Al) phase with a hexagonal structure was detected in the higher Co and Ti containing alloy(alloy50). At temperatures lower than 1023 K, the compressive yield stress increased with increasing Co content up to 28.6 mass% and Ti content up to 7.4 mass%, but decreased with more Co and Ti addition. At temperatures higher than 1273 K, all the alloys showed similar yield stress.

SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB The high-temperature strength and deformation behavior of gamma/gamma ' two-phase Co-Al-W-base alloys have been studied with polycrystalline and single-crystal materials, The ternary, quaternary and higher-order alloys containing Ta, Cr and/or Re exhibit flow stress anomalies above 873 K due to slip of pairs of 1/2 < 110 > superpartial dislocations on {001} planes, in addition to {111} planes, in the gamma' precipitates. Compression tests on the single-crystal specimens reveal a true anomalous peak temperature of 1073 K for both ternary and Ta-containing quaternary alloys. Above the peak, the ternary alloy exhibits a rapid decrease in strength with temperature, as 1/2 < 110 > dislocations bypass the gamma' precipitates without significant shearing. Conversely, the Ta-containing quaternary alloy sustains strength to higher temperatures due to the activation of 1/3 < 112 > partial dislocation slip that introduces a high density of stacking faults in the gamma' precipitates.

SO MATERIALS AND CORROSION-WERKSTOFFE UND KORROSION
AB A series of six alloys from Ni-25Cr-0.4C-6Ta to Co-25Cr-0.4C-6Ta with a progressive addition of Co in substitution to Ni were elaborated. They were tested for 24h at 1237 degrees C in laboratory air. The corrosion products formed around the samples and the deterioration of the subsurface were analyzed to characterize the high temperature oxidation behavior of these alloys. Three of the studied alloys, the nickel-richest ones, well behaved until 24h at this temperature. Their external oxide scales were essentially composed of chromia. In contrast, locally, the three cobalt-richest alloys were starting to oxidize catastrophically. The significant worsening of the oxidation behavior from the 27wt% Co-containing alloy to the 41wt% Co-containing one suggests that a critical Co content exists between these two values.

AB New, cobalt-based alloys Containing ordered L1(2) precipitates have been investigated. With additions of Cr, Mo, Ni, Re, Ta, and V to the ternary Co-Al-W system, two phase gamma-gamma' microstructures have been established. Solidus and liquidus temperatures are 100 degrees C-150 degrees C higher than advanced nickel-based single-crystal alloys strengthened with the L1(2) phase. An anomalous rise in flow stress with temperature is observed. Single crystals have been solidified and partitioning during solidification is limited in the ternary; system, suggesting a high resistance to convective instabilities. Oxidation at 900 degrees C results in the formation of cobalt oxide. Following oxidation, an inner layer of Al2O3 is observed in uncoated Cr-containing alloys and Cr2O3 is observed in alloys subjected to chromization.

AB In order to investigate the influence of Co on creep deformation anisotropy, some Ni-base single crystal superalloys have been creep tested at 800 degrees C and 735 MPa. It is found that, although Go-containing alloys have higher creep resistance when the tensile direction is within 5 degrees of (100), they are much more sensitive to tensile orientation than Go-free alloys, which have similar creep rupture lives for tensile orientations within 25 degrees of (100). It is revealed that for Co-containing alloys the (111)(112) slip system is operative during first-stage creep, when heterogeneous deformation occurs. Also, the degree of heterogeneous deformation correlates very well with creep rupture lives. It may thus be concluded that Co is not essential in improving creep rupture properties of Ni-base superalloys. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science S.A.

AB The isothermal and cyclic oxidation behaviour of two Co modified aluminide coatings together with the simple aluminide coating were performed at 1000 degrees C and 1100 degrees C. All the three coatings show a much lower oxidation rate compared with the bare alloy. Results also indicate the addition of Co to the aluminide coating decreases the oxidation resistance slightly. It can be ascribed to that Co is easier to be oxidized than Ni at high temperature, and the Cr(W) rich phases which could act as a diffusion barrier are less in the coating with higher Co content.

TI Looking for New Polycrystalline MC-Reinforced Cobalt-Based Superalloys
   Candidate to Applications at 1200 degrees C
SO ADVANCES IN MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
AB For applications for which temperatures higher than 1150 degrees C can be encountered the currently best superalloys, the gamma/gamma' single crystals, cannot be used under stress because of the disappearance of their reinforcing gamma' precipitates at such temperatures which are higher than their solvus. Cobalt-based alloys strengthened by refractory and highly stable carbides may represent an alternative solution. In this work the interest was focused on MC carbides of several types. Alloys were elaborated with atomically equivalent quantities in M element (among Ti, Ta, Nb, Hf, or Zr) and in C. Script-like eutectic TiC, TaC, NbC, HfC, and ZrC carbides were successfully obtained in the interdendritic spaces. Unfortunately, only one type, HfC, demonstrated high morphological stability during about 50 hours at 1200 degrees C. The concerned alloy, of the Co-25Cr-0.5C-7.4Hf type (in wt.%), was further characterized in flexural creep resistance and air-oxidation resistance at the same temperature. The creep behaviour was very good, notably by comparison with amore classical Co-25Cr-0.5C-7.5Ta alloy, proving that the interest of HfC is higher than the TaC one. In contrast the oxidation by air was faster and its behaviour not really chromia-forming. Significant improvements of this chemical resistance are expected before taking benefit from the mechanical superiority of this alloy.

TI On the role of processing parameters in sintered new Co-based (W,Al)
   alloys
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB The demand for enhanced material performance and efficiency in high-temperature applications has motivated the development of novel Co-based superalloys. Co-Al-W-based superalloys with the gamma/gamma' structure have suitable properties for use at high temperature and are good candidates for replacing Ni-based superalloys in some applications. The current generation of Co-Al-W-based alloys has superior wear, corrosion, and oxidation resistance. The poor precipitation strengthening of these alloys compared to that of Ni-based superalloys can be overcome by designing the alloying system to promote gamma'-Co-3(Al, W) precipitation. In this work, the compositions of the selected Co-Al-W-based alloys were chosen because they improve the precipitation strengthening of the alloys. Starting from powders, the materials were fabricated by mechanical alloying (MA) and subsequently consolidated by field assisted hot pressing (FAHP). The prepared Co-Al-W superalloys have a large amount of well-dispersed nanoprecipitates in their microstructures and have nearly full density. The effects of the MA and consolidation process (FAHP) conditions on the microstructures and mechanical properties of selected samples are determined by comparing the samples. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Atom probe tomography reveals that Co and Cr partition to gamma, whereas Ti and Mo to gamma'. Additions of Mo and Cr to the reference Co-12Ti system lead to strong increases in gamma' volume fraction by about 25% and 12%, respectively. Element-specific spatial distribution maps along the [001] direction of the L1(2)-ordered gamma' phase reveal that both Mo and Cr preferentially replace Ti on its sublattice. The remaining excess Ti is available for formation of additional gamma', resulting in enhanced gamma' volume fractions. (C) 2018 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Rapid Assessment of Oxidation Behavior in Co-Based / Alloys
SO OXIDATION OF METALS
AB A high-throughput, non-destructive photostimulated luminescence spectroscopy (PSLS) technique was used to analyze fifty oxidized Co-based / alloy samples for the presence of -Al2O3. Alloys were produced by combinatorial ion-plasma deposition, and oxidation was performed at 1100 degrees C for 1h in air. PSLS measurements are compared with microscopy of oxides in cross-section to relate the presence of the luminescence signal of -Al2O3 with the thickness of the oxide scale. Analysis of the current dataset validates the use of PSLS as a rapid screening technique of oxidation behavior for the present materials system.

TI Effect of temperature on the reactivity between a CoCrMoSi alloy and 55
   wt% AlZn baths
SO CORROSION SCIENCE
AB The reactivity of metallic alloys with Al has important impacts in industrial components and in Co-based components has been associated with the Al-Co reactions. The reactivity between Al and a CoCrMoSi alloy was assessed by immersion tests in a 55 wt% AlZn bath and DSC tests of multilayered pure Al/CoCr-MoSi specimens. Phases were identified by XRD analysis. Results showed that the synthesis of Al-Co compounds occurs at a temperature as low as 380 degrees C. Despite the higher corrosion resistance of the Laves phase the performance of CoCrMoSi component is compromised by the reactivity between Al and elements from the Co solid solution regions.

Both elements are observed to partition more into the gamma-Co phase and the Ru addition decreases the gamma phase partitioning trend of Re.

TI Oxidation and microstructure evolution of cobalt aluminide coatings on
   directionally solidified superalloys during long term exposure at 1000
   degrees C
SO MATERIALS RESEARCH INNOVATIONS
AB Using low pressure chemical vapour deposition, cobalt aluminide coatings were deposited onto directionally solidified Ni based superalloys (DZ466 and DS GTD111). Isothermal oxidation testing of the coated specimens was performed at 1000 degrees C under atmospheric pressure for times up to 2500 h. Oxidation and interdiffusion behaviour of the coating superalloy systems was examined. It was observed that the oxide growth mode of both coating systems conformed to a staged parabolic law, with differences in the transient stage related to the growth of theta-Al2O3. Coating degradation and formation of chromium containing precipitates occurred during exposure because of severe interdiffusion between the coating and superalloy. The composition of the superalloy substrate played an important role in the microstructure evolution of the aluminide coating, and the corresponding mechanism is discussed.

AB The phase stability of intermetallic compounds of Co(3)X has been discussed with a focus on the gamma' phase of Co(3)Al, Co(3)W and Co(3)(Al, W) with the L1(2) Structure. The critical temperatures of the gamma' phase of Co(3)Al, Co(3)W and Co(3)(Al, W) compounds are estimated to be about 870 degrees C, 980 degrees C and 1076 degrees C, respectively. The effect of alloying elements on the Co-Al-W -base alloys was found to be very similar to that of Ni-base superalloys, where Ti, Ta, Nb and V are the gamma' stabilizing elements, while Mn, Fe and Cr are the gamma forming elements. The mechanical properties of Co-Al-W-base alloys were also found to be similar to those of Ni-base alloys. In particular, the flow strengths of Co-Al-W-base alloys at temperatures above 800 degrees C were comparable or higher than those of Ni-base superalloys, which implies that the Co-base superalloys strengthened by the gamma' phase have great potential as a new type of high-temperature alloys.

SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING AND PERFORMANCE
AB The 77 to 1200 K tensile properties of approximately 1.3 mm thick wrought sheet Co-base Haynes alloy 188 and Ni-base Haynes alloy 230 and Inconel 617 have been measured after heat treatment in air and vacuum for periods up to 22,500 h at 1093 K. Significant changes in structure were produced by prior exposures, including precipitation of second phases and, in the case of heat treatment in air, oxide scale and surface-connected grain boundary pits/oxides, as deep as 50 to 70 mum, in all three superalloys. Due to the geometry of the experiment, the vacuum-exposed samples were protected from loss of volatile elements by evaporation; hence, such specimens were simply given 1093 K anneals in an innocuous environment, which produced very little surface attack. Compared to the properties of as-received alloys, prior exposure tended to reduce both the yield strength and ultimate tensile strength, with the greatest reductions at 77 and 298 K. The most dramatic effect of heat treatment was found in the low-temperature residual tensile elongation, where decreases from 40 to 5 % at 77 K were found. Ductility is the only property that was found to have a consistent dependency on environment, with air exposure always yielding less tensile elongation than vacuum exposure.

TI Effects of Nickel Content on Microstructural Evolution and gamma'
   Dissolution of Co-8.8Al-9.8W Base Alloys
SO RARE METAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING
AB To study the effects of nickel contents (5%, 15%, 25% and 35%, atomic fraction) on microstructural evolution and gamma' dissolution behavior of Co-Al-W base alloys, the gamma' phase microstructural evolution, gamma' phase transformation temperatures and microhardness of Co-Al-W base alloys with aging treatment were analyzed using scanning-electron microscope (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) etc. Results show that with the increasing of Ni content, gamma' solvus temperature increases at different degrees and the volume fraction of gamma' phase increases gradually. When the nickel content in Co-8.8Al-9.8W alloy reaches 25%, gamma' phase transformation temperature increases to 1100 C. The solidus temperatures and gamma' phase morphology of the four Co-Al-W base alloys are nearly unchanged. The typical gamma/gamma' two-phase microstructure is generated in the four alloys after the heat treatment at 900 degrees C for 50 h. After aging at 900 degrees C for 100 h, the gamma' phase volume fraction decreases and the gamma' phase is obviously coarsened. The microhardness of the four alloys after heat treatment at 900 degrees C for 50 and 100 h indicates that the microhardness is raised from 5Ni alloy to 15Ni alloy, but is lowered when further increasing the Ni content. With the aging treatment time from 50 h to 100 h, the volume fraction of gamma' phase decreases and y' phase coarsens, which reduces the hardness of Co-8.8Al-9.8W-based alloy.

Analysis at a nanoscale resolution by gallium focused ion beam sputtering and quadrupole-based secondary ion mass spectrometry of the surface oxide cross-sections provided evidence of both anion and cation motion during the second oxygen-18 oxidation where parabolic oxidation rate conditions can be assumed. These experiments provide new insights into the mass transport vectors for modeling the important oxidation mechanisms at extreme service conditions in mixed cobalt- and nickel-base alloys.

AB The anodic behaviour of surface-oxidised Ni-Fe-Co alloys was investigated over short-term periods of aluminium electrolysis. Additions of 10wt% Co were found to significantly improve the anodic wear resistance, due to suppression of FexO formation. Anodes having cobalt contents >= 30wt% exhibited poor performance due to rapid outwards diffusion of cobalt to the reaction interface. In general, the protective ability of the preformed oxide scales was greatly affected by the level of porosity and surface adhesion. In electrolytes containing <4wt% Al2O3, catastrophic failure of the anodes was observed due to concentration polarisation at the reaction interface. Under these conditions, the metal was rapidly destroyed by a combination of dissolution and fluoridation events.

AB A microstructural investigation of Type-II hot corrosion was carried out on a single crystal Ni-based superalloy (CMSX-4) pre-coated with Na2SO4 at 700 degrees C in a flowing O-2-SO2-SO3 atmosphere. Corrosion occurred by rapid dissolution of the alloy by molten sulfate eutectics, forming an outer layer rich in Co and Ni and an inner layer rich in Cr and Al. The outer layer transformed into mixed oxides of Co and Ni, with concurrent evolution of the continuous S-rich inner layer. A multicomponent analysis provides insight into diffusional interactions among Co, Ni, and S. Crystal orientation and microstructure effects were also studied. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

CL Las Vegas, NV
AB Multi-component metallic alloys have been developed to withstand high-temperature service in corrosive environments. Some of these applications, like exhaust valve seats in internal combustion engines. must also resist sliding, impact, and abrasion. The conjoint effects of temperature, oxidation, and mechanical contact can result in accelerated wear and the formation of complex surface layers whose properties differ from those of the base metal and the oxide scale that forms in the absence of mechanical contact. The authors have investigated the effects of prior surface damage, produced by scratch tests, on the localized reformation of oxide layers. Three high-performance commercial alloys, based on iron, nickel, and cobalt, were used as model materials. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was used to determine their static oxidation rates at elevated temperature (850 degrees C). A micro-abrasion, ball-cratering technique was used to measure oxide layer thickness and to supplement the TGA results. By using taper-sectioning techniques and energy-dispersive elemental mapping, a comparison was made between oxide compositions grown on non-damaged surfaces and oxides that formed on grooves produced by a diamond stylus. Microindentation and scratch hardness data revealed the effects of high-temperature exposure on both the substrate hardness and the nature of oxide scale disruption. There were significant differences in elemental distribution between statically formed oxides and those that formed on scratched regions. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A set of advanced single crystalline gamma' strengthened Co-base superalloys with at least nine alloying elements (Co, Ni, Al, W, Ti, Ta, Cr, Si, Hf, Re) has been developed and investigated. The objective was to generate multinary Co-base superalloys with significantly improved properties compared to the original Co-Al-W-based alloys. All alloys show the typical gamma/gamma' two-phase microstructure. A gamma' solvus temperature up to 1174 degrees C and gamma' volume fractions between 40 and 60 pct at 1050 degrees C could be achieved, which is significantly higher compared to most other Co-Al-W-based superalloys. However, higher contents of Ti, Ta, and the addition of Re decrease the long-term stability. Atom probe tomography revealed that Re does not partition to the gamma phase as strongly as in Ni-base superalloys. Compression creep properties were investigated at 1050 degrees C and 125 MPa in < 001 > direction. The creep resistance is close to that of first generation Ni-base superalloys. The creep mechanisms of the Re-containing alloy was further investigated and it was found that the deformation is located preferentially in the gamma channels although some precipitates are sheared during early stages of creep. The addition of Re did not improve the mechanical properties and is therefore not considered as a crucial element in the design of future Co-base superalloys for high temperature applications. Thermodynamic calculations describe well how the alloying elements influence the transformation temperatures although there is still an offset in the actual values. Furthermore, a full set of elastic constants of one of the multinary alloys is presented, showing increased elastic stiffness leading to a higher Young's modulus for the investigated alloy, compared to conventional Ni-base superalloys. The oxidation resistance is significantly improved compared to the ternary Co-Al-W compound. A complete thermal barrier coating system was applied successfully.

AB Seven alloys containing different contents of rhenium and cobalt are investigated to explore systematically the effects of rhenium and cobalt on microstructures and gamma' coarsening. The alloys are exposed to different periods at 950 degrees C and 1050 degrees C. In the alloys containing rhenium, gamma' coarsening is controlled by diffusion. Diffusion coefficient rises with the decreasing of rhenium and the increasing of cobalt. In the alloys containing 4 wt.% Re and Co free, there is TCP phase precipitation when exposed at 1050 degrees C. Additions of 3 wt.% Co to the alloy suppress the formation of TCP phase completely. Co reduces or eliminates the adverse effects of Re. In the Re-free alloys, there is no TCP formation and the coarsening mechanisms are complex. The competition in rate-controlling between diffusion and interface reaction on coarsening kinetics is dependent on the elements and the diffusion behavior. A model describing the process of forming rafts is also established. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Superalloys, used for turbine blades and jet engines for airplanes, have low heat conduction and high strength at elevated temperature. These properties make it very difficult to obtain effective grinding processes with high accuracy. Superalloys with fine performance under high temperature circumstances attract great attention to be used as the material for turbine blades. It has been expected to establish reliable efficient grinding of superalloys at the final grinding process.
   In this study, the influence of wheel wear, grinding ratio, and surface roughness, with the grinding process of superalloys, using metal bonded CBN wheel were carefully observed. Since superalloys have lower heat conduction and they cause a severe wheel wear, which leads to low grinding ratio. However, the high grinding ratio of about 800 and the stable figure of surface roughness of Rz=2 mu m were obtained when Co-base PWA647 and X45 were ground by using metal-bonded CBN wheel.
   Consequently, the Co-base superalloys perform rather well producing finer grinding process than the intensive Ni-base or Fe-base superalloys.

TI Microstructure and compression strength of Co-based superalloys hardened
   by gamma ' and carbide precipitation
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB A Co-based superalloy, Co-9Al-9W (at%), was processed by mechanical alloying by high-energy milling of elemental powders and consolidated by field assisted hot pressing (FAHP). The milled powder particles mainly consist of undissolved bcc-W as well as WC and an Al and W rich fcc-gamma Co solid solution. After consolidation and heat treatment a fine grained microstructure with a high fraction of carbides and a gamma/gamma' microstructure was obtained. The compressive yield strength at room temperature was found to be 45% higher than that of previously reported results for Co-based superalloys. A similar level of strength was found at 700 degrees C. These extraordinary properties can be explained due to the multitude of hardening mechanisms that sintered Co-based superalloys possess: gamma' precipitation, carbide formation and the ultra-fine se-grain size promoted by the fast consolidation technique.

TI Thermal parameters determination of Co-Al-W as-cast alloy homogenization
   by DTA analysis
SO JOURNAL OF THERMAL ANALYSIS AND CALORIMETRY
AB The gamma-gamma' Co-based superalloys are newly developed class of refractory alloys which may replace commercial Ni-based superalloys owing to their favorable properties at high temperature. In case of new Co-based superalloys, the heat treatment aims to obtain microstructure composed of appropriate volume fraction of small cuboidal gamma'-Co-3(Al, W) precipitates within the gamma-Co matrix. However, due to a high tendency to interdendritic segregations of alloying elements, the alloys based on Co-Al-W system should be normally homogenized before further steps of heat treatment (solutionizing and aging). In this study, thermal analysis was applied for determination of temperature range for primary heat treatment of the Co-9Al-9W (at.%). The differential thermal analysis (DTA) measurements were carried out on the thermal analyzer NETZSCH STA 449 F3 Jupiter. On the base of obtained results, respectively, solvus of gamma' phase and solidus temperatures were determined, as well as the thermal range of Co3W (DO19) phase precipitation. As a consequence, the heat treatment without homogenizing (only solution and aging) was proposed as a most suitable way to obtain beneficial microstructure.

SO CORROSION SCIENCE
AB Y-Ce-Co-modified aluminide coating on nickel base superalloys was prepared by pack cementation method. The microstructure and hot corrosion behavior of the coating were investigated. The results indicate that Y-Ce-Co-modified aluminide coating has a mass gain of only 0.32 mg/cm(2) after hot corrosion at 1173 k for 100 h. The coating exhibits superior hot corrosion resistance to they-Co-modified and Co-modified aluminide coatings. The improved hot corrosion resistance of the Y-Ce-Co-modified aluminide coating is mainly attributed to the synergistic effect of Y and Ce. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Methods for the preparation of selected metal perrhenates and their mixtures are presented in this paper. These materials are suitable for reduction, and therefore for production of alloy powders containing rhenium and other superalloy components, i.e., Cr, Ni and Co. Prepared compounds may be also used as substrates for electrowinning of binary and ternary rhenium alloys. All developed methods are based on an ion exchange technique. This technique allows management of waste solutions, limitation of valuable metals losses, and, importantly, production of high-purity components.

CL Wildbad Kreuth, GERMANY
AB The effect of the nitrogen on the microstructure and properties of a cast Co-based superalloy K640S was investigated with the different level ranged from 24 ppm to 85 ppm. The results indicate that almost all nitrogen exist in the form of nitride precipitation in the vacuum induction melting. It is found that high N level would extend the solidification window during the solidification process, and then increase the quantity of the carbide eutectic phases and led to the distribution in the network form of the eutectics in the interdendritic regions. High nitrogen content (more than 40 ppm) can reduced the mechanical properties of the testing alloy. So, it is suggested that the nitrogen in the recycled Co-based superalloys should be controlled at a suitable level in order to avoid the degradation of their properties.

Isothermal sections of the Co-Ni-W, Co-Ni-Mo, Co-Ni-Nb and Co-Ni-Ta systems at both 900 degrees C and 800 degrees C were constructed for the first time from electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) measurements on two Co-CoAl-Cr-Mo-Ni-Nb-Ta-W diffusion multiples. The new data will serve as experimental input to future thermodynamic assessments of the Co-Ni-X ternary systems in order to improve the thermodynamic databases for the design and development of advanced Ni-based and Co-based superalloys.

SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB The evolution of a eta phase (Ni(3)Ti) in Ni-Co base superalloys with different Co and Ti content has been investigated. The results showed that the eta phase existed in the samples with 23.1 wt.%Co and 5.4 wt.%Ti (TMW-3) and also the samples with 28.6 wt.% Co and 7.4 wt.%Ti (TMW-5) heat-treated at the temperature ranges of 1100-1140 degrees C, but not in the samples with 26.3 wt.%Co and 6.0 wt.%Ti (TMW-4). Even in TMW-3 and TMW-5, higher solution temperature (1180 degrees C) can fully reduce the formation of the eta phase. The evolution of the eta phase is complicated and may be related to the Ti content, Ti/Al ratio and alloy's composition. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Investigation of the elemental partitioning behaviour and site
   preference in ternary model nickel-based superalloys by atom probe
   tomography and first-principles calculations
SO PHILOSOPHICAL MAGAZINE
AB The topologically close-packed phase formation is heavily influenced by the concentrations of Co, Ru, and Cr in Ni-based superaloys. For this purpose, we investigate the partitioning behaviour and site preference of these additions in the model Ni-Al-X single crystal superalloys by atom probe tomography and first-principles calculations. Compared with the commercial multicomponent superalloys, Co and Ru still strongly partition to the gamma phase, while Cr weakly partitions to the gamma phase in the ternary model alloys. Based on the gamma' phase composition analyses, Ru and Cr atoms preferentially substitute for the Al sublattice sites, whereas Co atoms substitute at both Al and Ni sublattice sites in the ordered gamma'-Ni3Al phase. First-principles calculations on the substitutional formation energies at 0 K were performed to understand the site preference, and the partitioning coefficient of additions was given in a quantitative model. The partitioning behaviour and site preference of Co, Ru, and Cr by theoretical calculations are consistent with the experimental results.

Reaction kinetics during oxidation at 900 degrees C were assessed by thermogravimetry and measurements of individual layer thicknesses in the multilayered oxide scales. The development of diffusion-limiting barrier layers as well as the extent of sub-scale phase transitions could be directly correlated to the Co/Ni ratio in the alloy. For the first time a surface pretreatment with F was applied to Co-base superalloys. Apparent differences in the efficacy of the halogen effect depending on the Co content in the model alloys were observed.

AB Plastic deformation mechanisms in a crept L1(2) hardened Co-base superalloy are investigated by transmission electron microscopy. The deformation happens mainly in the cobalt solid solution matrix by slip of ordinary a/2 < 101 > {111} dislocations and rafting of the gamma' precipitates perpendicular to the external compressive stress axis is observed. Dislocation structures are early stages of the development of gamma/gamma' interfacial dislocation networks. Furthermore, gamma' precipitates are sheared by partial dislocations generating stacking faults which sometimes extend over matrix channels and neighbouring gamma' precipitates. Due to the positive lattice mismatch at creep temperature the dislocation activity in matrix channels perpendicular to the compressive external stress axis is less pronounced compared to parallel channels.

After heat treatment, all the designed alloys show different sizes of phases with typical cuboidal morphology occupying 75% of the total volume. With increasing Re content, the size of decreases obviously, while the size of decreases slightly with increasing Cr and Mo contents. Increasing W does not affect the size of . As a result of thermal exposure at 1000 degrees C for 1000 h, some acicular, rod-like, and blocky TCP phases are precipitated in most alloys. It is noted that Mo and Re can strongly promote the precipitation of TCP phase, but W has no obvious effect on TCP phase precipitation. In addition, transmission electron microscope analysis indicates that these TCP phases are sigma phase, phase, and R phase.

AB Co-base superalloys have been applied in the stationary compoents of gas turbine owing to their excellent high temperaure properties. The stationary Co-base alloy components are generally manufactured by casting. Solidification behavior of the alloy is an important factor in the selection of casting parameters. In the present study, solidification microstructure and carbide formation behaviors were studied by directional solidification. Directional solidification experiments were carried out at the solidification rates of 0.5 similar to 150 mu m/s with the Co-base superalloy ECY768. Between the dendrites just below the final freezing temperature, MC carbide and M23C6 carbide were found. It was identified that the script or blocky carbides were Ta or W-rich MC carbide, and the lamellar carbides were Cr-rich M23C6 eutectic carbides. The solid/liquid interface morphology clearly showed that freezing of the Cr-rich eutectic carbide occurred just after the script type MC carbide.

AB Oxidation mechanisms in polycrystalline Co-Ni-Cr-Al-W-Ta alloys were investigated using O-16/O-18 isotopic tracer analysis in the focused ion-beam secondary ion mass spectrometer (FIB-SIMS). It was found that Al additions favour the formation of a continuous alumina-rich layer, that Cr indirectly improved oxidation resistance and that increasing the Co fraction resulted in poorer oxidation performance. In the alloy containing 15 at.% Cr and 10 at.% Al, the outer scale formed after 200h oxidation at 800 degrees C comprised oxides less than 1 mu m thick. It is concluded that protective oxide scales can be formed in Co-Ni base superalloys. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

SO SCRIPTA MATERIALIA
AB In this study, the performance of hot compressive deformation was investigated in two newly developed Ni-Co based superalloys having different stacking fault energy (SFE). It is interesting to discover that nanograins (NGs) can be produced in superalloy deformed at high temperature and relatively low strain rate. With the decrease of SFE and strain rate, the formation of NGs will be promoted obviously, leading to the negative strain rate sensitivity of compressive stress in superalloys. The NGs, generated through the fragmentation of subgrains by microtwins, may become a candidate choice for dynamically strengthening superalloys at high temperature. (C) 2017 Acta Materialia Inc.

AB Present paper concerns primary structure of new type of tungsten-free cobalt-based superalloys with formula Co-Al-Mo-Nb. Due to replacement of W by addition of Mo and Nb, the desirable dual phase structure of gamma/gamma' should be formed after heat treatment of this alloy. In analyzed case, the alloy in as cast state was described. The Co-10Al-5Mo-2Nb (at%) alloy was casted via induction melting process. The specimens were cut from "foot" area of the rod and analyzed from phases and chemical point of view by XRD and EDS analysis. Detailed analysis of primary microstructure by light and scanning microscopy observations were performed. Obtained data revealed that in as cast state, the main phases detected in the alloy were solid solution of Co(AI,Mo,Nb) and Mo with Nb reach precipitations, probably with formula of Co-3(Mo,Nb). The morphology of observed interdendritic precipitations is typical for eutectic reaction. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Co-Si modified aluminide coating on nickel based superalloys was prepared by pack cementation process, then microstructure and hot corrosion resistance were studied. The mass gain of Co-Si modified aluminide coating is 0.32 mg/cm(2) after hot corrosion at 1173 K for 100 h. Si can boost the hot corrosion resistance by improving the formation of Al2O3. SiO2 has low solubility over a wide range of salt acidity and good stability in the melting Na2SO4 + NaCl, preventing rapid corrosion attack and prohibiting the high fluxing rate.

   case of cobalt-base superalloys and influence of dendrite fineness.
SO ANNALES DE CHIMIE-SCIENCE DES MATERIAUX
AB The effect of dendrite fineness on the high temperature oxidation behaviour was studied for a cast cobalt alloy Co-8Ni-30Cr-0.4C-6Ta (wt%) elaborated either in a conventional sand mould or in a water-cooled copper crucible. Its oxidation behaviour in air was studied at 1000, 1100 and 1200 degrees C for 100 hours. The parabolic constant Kp and the chromia volatilization constant Kv were determined by analyzing the (Delta m/S)center dot(d(Delta m/S)/dt) versus (-Delta m/S) curves. The Kp and Kv constants were confirmed by the agreement between mathematical and experimental mass gain curves. They are lower than those obtained for a nickel alloy with similar contents of alloying elements, and the same fine microstructure. The oxidation behaviours of the two dendrite finenesses were compared. The mass gain showed that the dendrite fineness influences the oxidation rate. More precisely, it does not really influence the parabolic oxidation but only the chromia volatilization, as revealed by the obtained Kp and Kv values. A coarser microstructure generally leads to a quicker volatilization of chromia.

TI Double minimum creep in the rafting regime of a single-crystal Co-base
   superalloy
SO SCRIPTA MATERIALIA
AB To investigate whether the formation of rafts in Co-base superalloys has a hardening or softening effect, the single crystal deformation behavior was studied in the high temperature/low stress creep regime. The large positive lattice misfit of the investigated Co-base superalloy led to a pronounced directional coarsening of the microstructure normal to the stress axis during compressive creep at 950 degrees C/150 MPa. Two creep minima were observed similar to Ni-base superalloys under tensile creep. Rafting was accompanied by a decreasing creep rate indicating a hardening effect, although cutting of gamma' rafts by partial dislocations under the formation of stacking faults occurred.

TI Electronic states calculation of cobalt by using the DV-X alpha cluster
   method
SO MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS
AB Using the DV-X alpha cluster method, two alloying parameters were calculated in fee Co. One was the bond order (Oo) which is a measure of the covalent bond strength between atoms and the other was the d-orbital energy level (Md) of alloying transition elements. These two alloying parameters were found to change monotonically with the atomic number of alloying 3d transition metals, M. The changes in the Bo with alloying elements could be understood in terms of the difference electron density maps. Also, the Co-M binary phase diagrams could be classified well using Bo-Md map. In addition, local spin moments at the alloying 3d transition metals were obtained. These results will provide us some guide for the design of cobalt-based alloys.

AB Aircraft engines components, including high and low pressure turbine blades and vanes, made of nickel and cobalt based superalloys, during long-term operation, are exposed to mass forces at elevated temperatures as well as corrosive agents. These conditions cause very high quality requirements for castings, both in terms of dimensional requirements, surface condition, as well as micro- and macrostructure. Quality of supplied charge materials is of fundamental importance for quality of castings, as all the bad qualities of the alloy transform naturally to the casting.

TI Effects of stacking fault energy on the creep behaviors of Ni-base
   superalloy
SO MATERIALS & DESIGN
AB Cobalt in a 23 wt.% Co containing Ni-base superalloys was systematically substituted by Ni in order to study the effects of stacking fault energy (SFE) on the creep mechanisms. The deformation microstructures of the alloys during different creep stages at 725 degrees C and 630 MPa were investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results showed that the creep life increased as the SFE decreased corresponding to the increase of Co content in the alloys. At primary creep stage, the dislocation was difficult to dissociate independent of SFE. In contrast, at secondary and tertiary creep stages the dislocations dissociated at gamma/gamma' interface and the partial dislocation started to shear gamma' precipitates, leaving isolated faults (IFs) in high SFE alloy, while the dislocations dissociated in the matrix and the partials swept out the matrix and gamma' precipitates creating extended stacking faults (ESFs) or deformation microtwins which were involved in diffusion-mediated reordering in low SFE alloy. It is suggested that the deformation microtwinning process should be favorable with the decrease of SFE, which could enhance the creep resistance and improve the creep properties of the alloys.

Two promising material systems have been chosen: first, alloys in the system Mo-Si-B which have demonstrated potential due to their high melting point of around 2,000A degrees C and due to the formation of a protecting borosilicate glass layer on the surface at temperatures exceeding 900A degrees C; and second, novel Co-Re-based alloys which have been chosen as a model system for complete miscibility between the elements cobalt and rhenium, offering the possibility of continuous increases of the melting point of the alloy through rhenium additions.

TI On the microstructural evolution and partitioning behavior of
   L1(2)-structured gamma '-based Co-Ti-W alloys upon Cr and Al alloying
SO INTERMETALLICS
AB We report on the effects of Cr and Al on the microstructure and elemental partitioning behavior of gamma/gamma' forming Co-Ti-W-based alloys. Additions of Cr to a Co-15Ti-3W (at.%) base alloy at the expense of Ti led to a decrease in gamma' volume fraction, whereas Al additions at the expense of Co led to substantially increased gamma' volume fractions. Such alloy modifications resulted in reduced gamma/gamma' lattice misfits. Using atom probe tomography, we could show that Ti and W strongly partitioned to the gamma' phase, whereas Al and Cr partitioned to gamma. While Cr appeared to have only minor effects on the partitioning behavior of the other alloying elements, Al enhanced partitioning of Ti and in particular W to gamma', thus causing the observed increases in gamma' volume fraction.

TI Oxidation behavior of Fe-Ni-Co based superalloys and influence of
   yttrium addition
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB The oxidation behavior of three Fe-Co-Ni based superalloys with different yttrium additions were investigated at 650 degrees C in air. The oxidation kinetics of the three alloys follows parabolic law initially, then follows linear law. The oxide scale formed on all three alloys consists mainly of Co dissolved Fe3O4 and partly of FeO and Fe2O3 in which Fe3O4 acts as a protective layer. An yttrium addition into the Fe-Co-Ni based superalloys improves their oxidation resistance by reducing the micro-defects in the scales. Thus, the weight gains of the alloys during the oxidation are reduced, and the transition of parabolic law to linear law is postponed. Pegging was observed on the cross section of alloy with 0.08 wt pet yttrium addition after the oxidation.

AB In the 2 1st century, generation of electrical power will play a critical role due to constantly rising global population and increasing energy demand. While energy resources such as oil, coal and natural gas are being rapidly exhausted, environmental concerns of global warming due to CO(2) emissions are simultaneously imposing limits on consumption of these limited resources.
   Natural gas is one of the most efficient industrial fuels and therefore, over the last two decades, its use with stationary gas turbines has increased dramatically. New nickel based superalloys and advanced coating systems have been introduced to further advance the efficiency of such natural gas power generation equipment. While such new technologies increase the cost of newly manufactured parts, refurbishment of service exposed parts has become of increasing importance in the gas turbine business. For this reason, for example, modem joining methods have been developed to repair single crystal parts at significantly lower prices compared to manufacture of new parts.
   Repair of turbine hot gas path components is a proven service offered to customers by Siemens Power Generation (Siemens PG). Highly advanced brazing and welding processes are routinely applied to repair gas turbine parts. Particular concerns in the repair of such turbine parts made of cobalt and nickel based superalloys include high susceptibility to hot cracking during welding and post weld heat treating. Special technological subtleties must be applied for successful repair including use of ductile filler materials, welding methods with low heat input, hot box welding and complicated pre- and post-weld heat treatments to avoid weld cracking.
   This paper deals with some repair welding technologies currently used at Siemens PG.

TI Diffusion of Co, Ru and Re in Ni-based superalloys: A first-principles

SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Self and impurity diffusivities in Ni-based superalloys have been investigated by first-principles calculations within five-frequency model. The vacancy formation energy, migration energy, correlation factor, solute-vacancy binding enthalpies and entropies in vacancy-mediated diffusions have been considered. The positive solute-vacancy binding energies for Co, Ru and Re indicated that the solute-vacancy pair is not a favorable binding. From the electronic point of view, the origination of the repulsive interaction between solute and vacancy has been comprehensibly expatiated on, which possibly accounts for the low diffusivity of Re element. The calculated self and impurity diffusion coefficients show a good consistent with the reported data from experiments and it is found that the trend in diffusivity is D-Co > DNi-self > D-Ru > D-Re.

Either Mo or Nb additions at the expense of W reduce alloy density to a similar extent. Increasing Mo substitution significantly decreases the gamma ' volume fraction and results in spherical gamma ' morphology at 750 degrees C, whereas Nb substitution shows opposite effects on the gamma ' volume fraction and morphology. Accordingly, the Mo and Nb additions raise and decrease the microhardness and high-temperature compression strength, respectively. The results can provide reference for the development of Co-based superalloys with low density and high strength.

AB Ni-based superalloys with aluminium belong to systems with order-disorder transition for the gamma and gamma' structures. Because of the complexity of these alloys, quaternary systems can be taken as suitable and sufficiently representative model systems for a theoretical study of their phase equilibria. In recent years several assessments including various model descriptions of ordered phases and ordering based on the CALPHAD formalism have been made with the aim to describe phase diagrams of relevant binary, ternary and some quaternary systems. For our study, the Ni-Al-Cr-Co system was chosen and phase boundaries of gamma and gamma' phase equilibrium were calculated based on the data for lower-order systems. The calculations were performed by means of the software 'Thermo-Calc'. Values obtained were compared with experimentally determined phase information for five alloys with constant Ni content (70 at.%) after long-term annealing at 900degreesC. The experiments were realized by means of energy-dispercive microanalysis in scanning transmission electron microscopy. For better agreement of theory with experiment, an thermodynamic optimization was performed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The cobalt base alloys were hardfaced on stainless steel plates as a single layer. The samples taken from the hardfaced materials were studied by optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and micro-hardness measurements. The hardness and wear resistance values of the layer obtained after the hardfacing processes are satisfactory and the process seem to be suitable for application.

CY APR 12-16, 2015
CL Toronto, CANADA
AB Cobalt-based superalloys are used in aero-engine combustor components due to their high strength and wear resistance at elevated temperatures. The objective of this investigation is to study the role of the surface oxide formed during the fretting process on the tribological behavior of this class of materials, at temperatures up to 550 degrees C. The investigation, which was carried out using a specially designed tribometer, showed that the wear coefficient and the coefficient of friction (COF) generally decrease with the increase of temperature at different work rates. When the work rate was fixed at relatively high value (350 mJ/s), the wear coefficient was found to decrease monotonically with temperature, while the COF experienced a peak at 200 degrees C. Analysis of the specimen fretted at 200 degrees C showed that the hard wear debris promoted abrasive wear and caused an increase in the COF. In addition, the formed oxide was thin, non-continuous and contained mainly cobalt monoxide (CoO), which contributed to the increase in the COF. Analysis of the specimen fretted at 550 degrees C showed that the wear damage decreased due to the formation of a continuous thick protective oxide containing mainly chromium (III) oxide (Cr2O3), known for its good tribological characteristics. It has also been observed that delamination wear took place within this oxide layer. When the oxide composition and thickness inside and outside the fretted area were compared, it was concluded that the real contact temperature exceeded 600 degrees C due to the frictional heat.

TI Influence of Co content on stacking fault energy in Ni-Co base disk
   superalloys
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS RESEARCH
AB The influence of Co content on stacking fault energy (SFE) of the gamma matrix in four Ni-Co base superalloys, including newly developed alloys, has been studied by utilizing high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. The results indicated the SFE was not linear with Co content of the gamma matrix. The lowest SFE could be attained at around 34.0 at.% Co. This effect was attributed to variation of electron holes, saturated Co content in the matrix, and the effect of Co on the partition coefficient of other alloying elements. A high density of twins was related to low SFE and could improve the mechanical properties.

TI Effect of Co on Discontinuous Precipitation Transformation with TCP
   Phase in Ni-based Alloy Containing Re
SO METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND
   MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB The effect of Co on discontinuous precipitation (DP) transformation involving the formation of topologically close-packed (TCP) phase was investigated in three Ni-Cr-Re model alloys containing different levels of Co. One typical TCP phase, sigma, was generated within DP cellular colonies along the migrating grain boundaries in experimental alloys during aging treatment. As a result of the increased solubility of Re in the gamma matrix and enlarged interlamellar spacing of sigma precipitates inside of growing DP colonies, Co addition suppressed the formation of sigma phase and associated DP colonies. This study suggests that Co could potentially serve as a microstructural stabilizer in Re-containing Ni-base superalloys, which provides an alternative method for the composition optimization of superalloys.

AB Y-Co-modified aluminide coatings on nickel base superalloys were prepared by pack cementation method. Effect of Y2O3 content in the pack mixture on microstructure and hot corrosion resistance of the coatings was investigated. The results show that with the increase in Y2O3 content, the content of Co in the coatings increases. The mass gain of the coatings with Y2O3 addition of 1, 2 and 3 wt.% is 0.6, 0.55 and 0.42 mg/cm(2) after hot corrosion at 1173 K for 100 h, respectively. Y2O3 addition accelerates the diffusion of Co and thus increases the hot corrosion resistance of the coating. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The results revealed that Mo promoted the formation of (mu+gamma) eutectic structure in the as-cast alloys and mu-phase precipitation after solution treatment. In addition, after aging treatment at 900 C, an extensive network of DO(19) precipitates was observed, besides the gamma+gamma' primary phases and the mu phase inherited from the as-cast and solution-treated conditions. Meanwhile, a solid-state transformation from the)1 phase to the DO(19) phase occurred; and long-term aging enhanced this transformation. In addition, high levels of Mo promoted the DO(19)-phase precipitation.

AB Co/Si co-doped beta-NiAl coating on nickel based superalloys was prepared using pack cementation method. Microstructure and cyclic oxidation behaviour of the coating were investigated. The weight loss of the coating is less than 3 mg/cm(2) after 3200 cycles at 1050 degrees C. The coating exhibits a good cyclic oxidation resistance. The addition of Si decreases the growth stress in the oxide scale by inhibiting the formation of harmful NiO. The formation of SiO2 particles at the scale/coating interface decreases the growth rate of the Al2O3 scale. Moreover, Si addition promotes the formation of the high Al-content phase beta-NiAl.

   TaC-containing cast alloys
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB A series of six alloys derived from a Ni-25Cr-0.4C-6Ta (wt.%) base one was developed by substituting nickel by cobalt. They were synthesized by casting and exposed to oxidative environment at two high temperatures. Their bulk microstructures were studied in as-cast condition and in two high temperature aged states. Their surfaces after oxidation during aging were characterized. The cobalt enrichment succeeded in avoiding chromium carbides formation and in stabilizing the TaC carbides at high temperature. As the high temperature morphologic stability of TaC was not perfect, it was much better than the one of the chromium carbides, but can be improved by the total removal of nickel. Unfortunately, at the same time, the oxidation behavior, initially good, shows increased rate of the oxides formation. The room temperature hardness was also significantly increased by the substitution of Ni by Co, and decreased after aging when carbides became rounder or fragmented. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Formation enthalpies have been used for the evaluation of stability, and are compared among the selected configurations. Based on the most energetically stable configurations, a ground-state line is sketched out for the Co-Mo sigma phase. Magnetic effects and electronic structures have also been explored to explain the compositional dependence of phase stability. The elastic constants and polycrystalline elastic moduli are calculated and exhibit similar compositional trends as the formation enthalpies. A significant degree of elastic anisotropy is predicted, which can shed light on the brittle nature and rapid crack propagation of sigma phase. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI On diffusion behaviors in face centered cubic phase of Al-Co-Cr-Fe-Ni-Ti
   high-entropy superalloys
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Owning the excellent high temperature properties, low cost and density, Al-Co-Cr-Fe-Ni-Ti high-entropy superalloys (HESAs) represent a potential substitute for Ni-based superalloys. In this paper, the composition-dependent interdiffusivity matrices of face centered cubic (fcc) Al-Co-Cr-Fe-Ni-Ti HESAs at 1473 K were first determined via a combination of diffusion multiple technique and HitDIC software based on the numerical inverse method. The correlations between the main interdiffusivities and the components suggest that alloying elements play great impact on diffusion in HESAs. After that, comprehensive comparisons of the interdiffusivities and tracer diffusivities in present fcc HESAs with the literature data in fcc-based pure elements, lower-order alloys and traditional high-entropy alloys were conducted. The results indicate that the sluggish diffusion effect exists for only some of the components in the present HESAs. Moreover, comparisons of the diffusion coefficients between the HESAs and traditional Ni-based superalloys with refractory elements show that the interdiffusivities in the present HESAs are lower than the Ni-based superalloys with most refractory elements, but higher than those with Ir, Re and Os. Furthermore, it is also found that refractory elements need to be added in order to further improve the creep resistance of the HESAs. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   by Neutron Scattering
SO METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND
   MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Co-Re-based alloys have been developed to supplement the Ni-base superalloys used in gas turbine applications at high temperatures (1473 K [1200 A degrees C] bare metal temperature). Unlike other commercial Co-based alloys, the Co matrix in the Co-Re alloys has a stable hexagonal close-packed (hcp) structure at room temperature. In situ neutron diffraction measurements on experimental Co-Re alloys hardened by carbide precipitates showed that the matrix undergoes an hcp a double dagger dagger face-centered cubic (fcc) allotropic transformation after heating to high temperatures. Furthermore, it was found that this transformation has a large hysteresis (similar to 100 K). Thermodynamic calculations were undertaken to study the high-temperature phase stability and transformations in the complex multicomponent, multiphase Co-Re-Cr-C system with or without the addition of Ta. The results show that the minor phases (Cr23C6-type carbides and the Cr2Re3-type sigma phase) play an important role in the hcp a double dagger dagger fcc hysteresis by influencing the partitioning of Cr and Re between the matrix and the other phases.

SO IRANIAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY TRANSACTION A-SCIENCE
AB The reverse indentation load-size effects of Fe-Mn-Si and Co-Mn-Si superalloy have been investigated by measuring Vickers hardness. The characterized superalloy samples are presented in the reverse indentation load-size effects, which is known as the microhardness increases with increasing applied load behavior. The theoretical model is rearranged and investigated according to the reverse indentation load-size effects using reconstituted Meyer law, proportional specimen resistance model, and modified proportional specimen resistance model. The reconstituted modified proportional specimen resistance model is highly suitable for describing the data of the Fe-Mn-Si and Co-Mn-Si alloys. SEM micrographs show that Co-based alloys exhibited a dendritic microstructure and Fe-based alloys were presented austenitic microstructure. In this study, the load range from 0.49 to 9.8N was applied to the materials, but no crack is observed on the surface of the material. This can only be attributed to the occurrence of the elastic deformation which yields reverse indentation size effect in these samples.

TI Corrosion behavior of new type Co-based superalloys with different Ni
   contents
SO CORROSION REVIEWS
AB The corrosion properties of gamma'-strengthened Cox Ni-Al-W-Cr (where x = 15, 20, 25, and 30 at.%) superalloys were investigated in the mixture of 75 wt.% Na-2 SO4 + 25 wt.% NaCl at 900 degrees C. The results showed that the corrosion behavior is associated with both sulfuration and oxidation processes. It was demonstrated that increasing the addition of Ni effectively promoted the formation of continuous Al2O3 scales, so that the hot corrosion resistance could be improved. When Ni content is more than 20 at.%, a large amount of Ni3S2 precipitates during the corrosion process. Sulfuration can destroy the integrity of the corrosion layer and increase the activity of oxygen. In this way, the internal oxidation of the alloys becomes more serious. Therefore, it is recommended that the optimum Ni addition is about 20 at.% for new type Co-Ni-Al-W-Cr superalloys.

AB Medium and high entropy superalloys based on the Ni-Co-Fe system with strengthening L1(2) gamma' precipitates have been developed. The present study has shown that by controlling the elemental partitioning between gamma/gamma', thermal stability of gamma' can be enhanced in the high entropy gamma matrix. Most importantly, high entropy superalloys exhibit stable gamma-gamma' microstructures with no TCP phases after long-term exposure at elevated temperatures. Therefore, a new alloy design space for stable gamma-gamma' microstructure has been presented. Furthermore, due to relatively high content of Fe and Ti, their raw materials cost and alloy density can potentially be lower than those of conventional superalloys.

SO RSC ADVANCES
AB The influence of the alloying elements Re, Co and W on the propagation of the (010)[ 101] Ni/Ni3Al interface crack has been investigated by molecular dynamics simulations and the discrete-variational method. The simulation results show that the interface crack propagates in a brittle manner at low temperature (5 K), but in a ductile manner at high temperature (1273 K), both with and without the addition of alloying elements. Owing to the scientific and technological importance of superalloys, the effects of the chemical bonding behavior between the alloying element X (X = Re, Co, or W) and Ni atoms on the crack shape, crack propagation velocity, and dislocation emission were investigated. At low temperature, the alloying elements Re and W inhibit the propagation of the Ni/Ni3Al interface crack, while at high temperature Re, Co and W can improve the ductility of Ni-based single-crystal superalloys. Furthermore, the adhesion work of the interface, surface energy, and unstable stacking energy were calculated to understand the propagation mechanism of the Ni/Ni3Al interface crack because of alloying element addition. The results of this study may provide useful information for the design of Ni-based superalloys.

AB The isothermal oxidation experiments were carried out on several new /-strengthened cobalt-base alloys Co-Al-W-4Cr-0.02X (X = La, Ce, Dy, Y) at 900 and 800 degrees C. Due to an appropriate content of additional elements, the change in the morphology occurred and it significantly improved the oxidation resistance compared with those without Cr, among which the one with La elements shows the best oxidation resistance. Multiple oxide layers are also formed during the oxidation process, with CoWO4 and CoAl2O4 phases in the outer layer, and Cr, Al, W, and Co (e.g., Cr2O3) in the middle layer. The inner layer consists of some Al2O3 oxides, while more protective Al2O3 oxide was formed, esp. at the temperature of 800 degrees C. Both Cr2O3 and Al2O3 oxides were effectively protective oxides, which can prevent the intrusion of oxygen into the alloy substrate. Moreover, a phase transformation (/ to /Co3W) was observed at the interface between oxide layer and substrate.

AB The quaternary alloy system Co-Al-W-Ge was investigated and it was found that a continuous gamma/gamma' two-phase field extends between the systems Co-Al-W and Co-Ge-W. All alloys examined comprised cuboidal L1(2) precipitates coherently embedded in an A1 matrix. Differential scanning calorimetry measurements revealed that the liquidus, solidus, and gamma'-solvus temperatures decrease when the Ge content is increased. The lower liquidus temperature and the capability of gamma'-strengthening in the Ge-rich alloys make them interesting as potential candidates for brazing applications of Co-base superalloys. The gamma/gamma' lattice misfit was determined by high-resolution X-ray diffraction and found to be positive for all alloys investigated, decreasing with increasing Ge content.

AB The development of novel industrial cast and wrought (C&W) disk alloys with required combination of strength, creep and fatigue resistances is always desired and a challenge to material researchers. Recently, in the High Temperature Materials 21 Project (HTM21) led by the Japanese National Institute for Materials Science (NIMS), we proposed an innovative concept to design disk alloys. This concept is based on combining the characters of two kinds of gamma-gamma' two-phase alloys (Ni-base and Co-base alloys) and leads up to some promising candidate alloys that can be processed by normal C&W processing route and shows at least a 30 degrees C increase in temperature capability over the current C&W U720Li disk alloy. This paper shows the design idea, workability and mechanical properties of some Ni-Co-base alloys. Furthermore, full-scale-disk forgings were processed successfully for the evaluations of the processing ability and microstructure of new Ni-Co-base disk alloys, which demonstrated the advantages and possibility of Ni-Co-base disk alloys at the component level.

TI High-Temperature Structural Stabilities of Ni-Based Single-Crystal
   Superalloys Ni-Co-Cr-Mo-W-Al-Ti-Ta with Varying Co Contents
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA-ENGLISH LETTERS
AB It has been recently pointed out that the compositions of industrial alloys are originated from cluster-plus-glueatom structure units in solid solutions. Specifically for Ni-based superalloys, after properly grouping the alloying elements into Al, Ni-like ((Ni) over bar), gamma'-forming Cr-like ((Cr) over tilde (gamma')) and gamma-forming Cr-like ((Cr) over bar (gamma)), the optimal formula for single-crystal superalloys is established [ Al-(Ni) over bar (12)](Al-1(Cr) over bar (gamma')(0.5) (Cr) over bar (gamma)(1.5)). The Co substitutions for Ni at the shell sites are conducted on the basis of the first-generation single-crystal superalloy AM3, formulated as [Al-Ni12-xCox](Al1Ti0.25Ta0.25Cr1W0.25Mo0.25), with x = 1.5, 1.75, 2 and 2.5 (the corresponding weight percents of Co are 9.43, 11.0, 12.57 and 15.71, respectively). The 900 degrees C long-term aging follows the Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner theory (LSW theory), and the Co content does not have noticeable influence on the coarsening rate of gamma'. The microstructure and creep behavior of the four (001) single-crystal alloys are investigated. The creep rupture lifetime is reduced as Co increases. The alloy with the lowest Co (9.43 Co) shows the longest lifetime of about 350 h at 1050 degrees C/120 MPa, and all the samples show N-type rafting after creep tests.

TI Atomistic phase field chemomechanical modeling of
   dislocation-solute-precipitate interaction in Ni-Al-Co
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB Dislocation-precipitate interaction and solute segregation play important roles in controlling the mechanical behavior of Ni-based superalloys at high temperature. In particular, the increased mobility of solutes at high temperature leads to increased dislocation-solute interaction. For example, atom probe tomography (APT) results [1] for single crystal MC2 superalloy indicate significant segregation of solute elements such as Co and Cr to dislocations and stacking faults in gamma' precipitates. To gain further insight into solute segregation, dislocation-solute interaction, and its effect on the mechanical behavior in such Ni-superalloys, finite-deformation phase field chemomechanics [2] is applied in this work to develop a model for dislocation-solute-precipitate interaction in the two-phase gamma-gamma' Ni-based superalloy model system Ni-Al-Co. Identification and quantification of this model is based in particular on the corresponding Ni-Al-Co embedded atom method (EAM) potential [3]. Simulation results imply both Cottrell and Suzuki-type segregation of Co in gamma and gamma'. Significant segregation of Co to dislocation cores and faults in gamma' is also predicted, in agreement with APT results. Predicted as well is the drag of Co by gamma dislocations entering and shearing gamma'. Since solute elements such as Co generally prefer the gamma phase, Co depletion in gamma' could be reversed by such dislocation drag. The resulting change in precipitate chemistry may in turn affect its stability and play a role in precipitate coarsening and rafting. (C) 2019 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Design of Novel Precipitate-Strengthened Al-Co-Cr-Fe-Nb-Ni High-Entropy
   Superalloys
SO METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND
   MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB A series of non-equiatomic Al-Co-Cr-Fe-Nb-Ni high-entropy alloys, with varying levels of Co, Nb and Fe, were investigated in an effort to obtain microstructures similar to conventional Ni-based superalloys. Elevated levels of Co were observed to significantly decrease the solvus temperature of the gamma' precipitates. Both Nb and Co in excessive concentrations promoted the formation of Laves and NiAl phases that formed either during solidification and remained undissolved during homogenization or upon high-temperature aging. Lowering the content of Nb, Co, or Fe prevented the formation of the eutectic type Laves. In addition, lowering the Co content resulted in a higher number density and volume fraction of the gamma' precipitates, while increasing the Fe content led to the destabilization of the gamma' precipitates. Various aging treatments were performed which led to different size distributions of the strengthening phase. Results from the microstructural characterization and hardness property assessments of these high-entropy alloys were compared to a commercial, high-strength Ni-based superalloy RR1000. Potentially, precipitation-strengthened high-entropy alloys could find applications replacing Ni-based superalloys as structural materials in power generation applications.

TI The synchronous improvement of strength and plasticity (SISP) in new
   Ni-Co based disc superalloys by controling stacking fault energy
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB It is a great challenge to improve the strength of disc superalloys without great loss of plasticity together since the microstructures benefiting the strength always do not avail the plasticity. Interestingly, this study shows that the trade-off relationship between strength and plasticity can be broken through decreasing stacking fault energy (SFE) in newly developed Ni-Co based disc superalloys. Axial tensile tests in the temperature range of 25 to 725 degrees C were carried out in these alloys with Co content ranging from 5% to 23% (wt.%). It is found that the ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and uniform elongation (UE) are improved synchronously when microtwinning is activated by decreasing the SFE at 650 and 725 degrees C. In contrast, only UTS is improved when stacking fault (SF) dominates the plastic deformation at 25 and 400 degrees C. These results may be helpful for designing advanced disc superalloys with relatively excellent strength and plasticity simultaneously.

AB The effects of micro-additions of boron and zirconium on grain-boundary (GB) structure and strength in polycrystalline y(f.c.c.) plus y'(L1(2)) strengthened Co-9.5A1-7.5W-X at% alloys (X=0-Ternary, 0.05B, 0.01B, 0.05Zr, and 0.005B-0.05Zr at%) are studied. Creep tests performed at 850 degrees C demonstrate that GB strength and cohesion limit the creep resistance and ductility of the ternary B- and Zr-free alloy due to intergranular fracture. Alloys with 0.05B and 0.005B-0.05Zr both exhibit improved creep strength due to enhanced GB cohesion, compared to the baseline ternary Co-9.5A1-7.5W alloy, but alloys containing 0.01B or 0.05Zr additions display no benefit. Atom-probe tomography (APT) is utilized to measure GB segregation, where B and Zr are demonstrated to segregate at GBs. A Gibbsian interfacial excess of 5.57 +/- 1.04 atoms nm(-2) was found for B at a GB in the 0.01B alloy and 2.88 +/- 0.81 and 2.40 +/- 0.84 atoms nm(-2) for B and Zr, respectively, for the 0.005B-0.05Zr alloy. The GBs in the highest B-containing (0.05B) alloy exhibit micrometer-sized boride precipitates with adjacent precipitate denuded-zones (PDZs), whereas secondary precipitation at the GBs is absent in the other four alloys. The 0.05B alloy has the smallest room temperature yield strength, by 6%, which is attributed to the PDZs, but it exhibits the largest increase in creep strength (with an similar to 2.5 order of magnitude decrease in the minimum strain rate for a given stress at 850 degrees C) over the baseline Co-9.5A1-7.5W alloy.

AB Silicon nitride (Si3N4) based ceramic tools exhibit good machinability in cutting materials such as gray cast iron, ductile iron, malleable cast iron, and superalloys due to excellent high-temperature mechanical properties. In this paper, high-performance Si3N4-based ceramic tools containing tungsten carbide (WC) and cobalt (Co) were studied. Effects of the WC content and Co content on mechanical properties and a microstructure of Si3N4-based ceramic materials were analyzed. Results showed that Si3N4-based ceramic material containing 10 wt % WC and 1 wt % Co had the best comprehensive mechanical properties at a sintering temperature of 1650 degrees C and holding time of 6 min, achieving Vickers hardness, fracture toughness, and room temperature bending strength of 16.96 GPa, 7.26 MPam(1/2), and 1132 MPa, respectively. The microstructure of Si3N4-based ceramic tool material is uniform without obvious abnormal growth. The Si3N4-based ceramic tool was mainly composed of -Si3N4, -Si3N4, and WC phases.

AB Isothermal oxidation was carried out on new gamma/gamma ' Co-base superalloys of the system Co-Al-W-B. Appropriate B-contents lead to improved oxidation resistance and oxide layer adhesion. Oxidation at 800 and 900 degrees C results in formation of Co3O4, CoO, and complex oxides (containing Co, Al, and W). A continuous and protective inner alumina layer forms only at 800 degrees C. Furthermore, oxidation leads to phase transformation (gamma/gamma ' to gamma/Co3W microstructure) at the matrix/oxide layer interface due to Al-depletion. The effect of additional alloying elements such as Ta, Cr, Nb, Si, V. Mo, and It on the oxidation behaviour was also investigated. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB With the aim of understanding how to further improve the creep resistance of Co-Al-W-base superalloys at higher temperature (> 1223 K), the creep behavior of a novel Co-Al-W-base single-crystal superalloy at 1273 K/137 MPa was systematically investigated. Several interrupted creep tests were performed and the main deformation mechanisms of characteristic creep stages were identified and correlated to both the gamma/gamma' microstructural and dislocation substructural evolutions. Two steady-state creep stages were observed during the creep process. The interfacial dislocations and the formation of rafts were responsible for the first steady-state creep stage, while the second steady-state creep stage could be ascribed to interactions between stacking faults of different slip systems in an inverted gamma/gamma' microstructure, e.g., the formation of Lomer-Cottrell locks by the leading partials of the SFs. The observed creep mechanisms were compared to those typical of Ni-base superalloys at similar creep conditions. It is suggested that a high stacking fault energy of the gamma' phase and a higher gamma' volume fraction may be favorable for creep resistance of Co-Al-W-base single-crystal superalloys by promoting the double steady-state creep phenomenon.

Main alloying elements, in addition to Co, are Cr, Ni, Ta, Mo, W, Ti, Al, etc. and C. In order to simulate these materials a new thermodynamic database has been implemented which includes the six most important alloying elements: Co, Cr, Ni, Ta, W and C.

Interaction parameters for all the binary and ternary sub-systems are included. When possible they have been taken from the literature but, for several systems, partial or complete reassessment was needed, due to inconsistency of the phase models or incompatibility between assessments of different authors. As a result phase equilibria in selected commercial alloys are calculated. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study examines the performance of a new class of wear-resistant but economical cutting tools produced by varying the binder composition of standard cemented carbide composites. By replacing some or all of the cobalt binder with rhenium and nickel-based superalloy, a stronger composite tool results, potentially capable of machining heat-resistant superalloys at significantly higher cutting speeds. Sample tools with alternative binder were produced and compared to standard tools bound with cobalt only. Turning experiments on Inconel 718 were run to evaluate wear resistance and tool life for several grades. The experimentation also examined the effects of varying the relative proportions of each binder constituent as well as the overall binder percentage in the composite. Results show a clear advantage of the alternative binder tools as evidenced by a 150% increase in tool life or the equivalent of an 18% increase in cutting speed. Although increasing amounts of rhenium in the binder show a positive effect on performance, the effects of superalloy and overall binder % are inconclusive.

AB New gamma'-strengthened Co-base superalloys show an interesting potential for high temperature applications. However, protective coatings are needed as for Ni-base superalloys to ensure sufficient oxidation and corrosion resistance. Therefore the properties of a commercial coating on a multinary new gamma'-strengthened Co-base superalloy have been studied. Especially the influence of the coating process on the substrate also after long term annealing is discussed. It was found that the highly deformed areas at the coating-substrate interface indicated by a high local misorientation and caused by the sandblasting process led to a recrystallization of the interdiffusion zone during the age hardening heat treatment. A chemical gradient of gamma and gamma' promoting elements was found in the interdiffusion zone causing a change in hardness as measured by nanoindentation. Depending on the composition two separate recrystallized regions formed in the interdiffusion zone, one with single phase gamma-(Co,Ni) and the other with a cellular two phase microstructure of discontinuously grown gamma and gamma'.

TI Current status of Co-Re-based alloys being developed to supplement
   Ni-based superalloys for ultra-high temperature applications in gas
   turbines
SO KOVOVE MATERIALY-METALLIC MATERIALS
AB Although Ni-based sup eralloys meet the gas turbine needs of today, they are used very close to their melting range. To meet the future demands of gas turbines new materials with higher application temperatures are needed. Addition of Re increases the melting temperature of Co-based alloys and they show promise to supplement Ni-superalloys for ultra high temperature applications. The Co-Re alloy development strategy is first discussed here briefly. Unlike single crystal Ni-superalloys with the gamma-gamma' structure, the Co-Re alloys have complex microstructure with many different phases present in diverse morphology. MC type carbides are the main hardening precipitate particularly used for high temperature creep resistance. Further, Cr and Si additions in Co-Re alloys provide oxidation resistance. Designing optimal microstructure and ensuring its stability is an essential task of high temperature alloy development. In our alloy development program neutron and synchrotron measurements are extensively used. It allows monitoring the microstructure evolution in-situ at high temperatures and thereby helps in understanding the relatively unexplored Co-Re alloy system. Recent results on the effect of C/Ta ratio on the TaC morphology in Co-Re-based alloys are presented as well.

TI Development of gamma phase stacking faults during high temperature creep
   of Ru-containing single crystal superalloys
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB An unusual deformation mode involving the formation of intrinsic stacking faults in the gamma matrix of experimental Ru-containing gamma-gamma' superalloys with high Co and Re contents during high temperature creep at 950 degrees C/290 MPa has been observed. The morphology, distribution and dependence of these stacking faults on alloy chemistry has been investigated along with their formation mechanism. Additions of Re and Co substantially decrease the stacking fault energy of the 7 matrix. The observed stacking faults in the T matrix form by the dissociation of a/2 < 1 1 0 > matrix dislocations with Burgers vectors perpendicular to the loading direction in the early stages of creep. The dependence of creep properties on elemental additions that influence stacking fault energy is discussed. Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of Acta Materialia Inc.

TI Effect of rhenium and cobalt additions on the microstructure and gamma
   prime phase stability of vacuum arc melted modified nickel-based
   superalloys grade MGA 1400
SO MATERIALS TESTING
AB The effect of rhenium and cobalt additions on the microstructure and gamma prime phase stability of modified nickel-based superalloy, grade MGA1400 by means of a vacuum arc melting method with different contents of rhenium (Re) and cobalt (Co) was investigated. After being subjected to heat treatment, the size of the gamma prime particles was slightly reduced with increasing rhenium content. Then, the alloys were exposed at a temperature of 1173 K for 1800 ks. The results showed that increasing the rhenium addition leads to a slower coarsening rate of the gamma prime particles. Furthermore, the shape of the gamma prime particles changed to a more cubic shape. However, an excessive rhenium content (> 1.21 wt.-%) promotes the formation of a topologically close-packed phase after a 360 ks exposure at 1173 K. It can be concluded that an increase in rhenium content can result in a lower coarsening rate of the gamma prime particles. The cobalt addition is beneficial for impeding or slowing the precipitation of topologically close-packed phases at an elevated temperature.

TI CREEP-RUPTURE LIFE AND ALLOY MANUFACTURING CRITERION RELATED TO THE
   SOLIDIFICATION AND PRECIPITATION TEMPERATURES IN NICKEL-BASED
   SINGLE-CRYSTAL SUPERALLOYS
SO TETSU TO HAGANE-JOURNAL OF THE IRON AND STEEL INSTITUTE OF JAPAN
AB The solidification and precipitation temperatures were measured and were correlated with the creep-rupture property and the microstructure of nickel-based single crystal superalloys.  For three Co-content varying Ni-10 mol% Cr-12 mol% Al-1.5 mol% Ti-Ta-W-Mo-0.25 mol% Re-0/4.5/9.0 mol% Co alloys and also for three Cr-content varying Ni-10/13/16 mol% Cr-12 mol% Al-1.2 mol%Ti-Ta-W-Mo alloys, the liquidus, solidus, eutectic gamma' precipitation and gamma' solvus temperatures were determined by differential thermal analysis (DTA).  It was found that as the Co and Cr contents increased, the gamma' solvus temperature decreased and there was the attendant decrease in the volume fraction of the gamma' phase in the alloys.  In response to these changes the creep-rupture lives decreased with the Co and Cr contents.  These results imply that the gamma' solvus temperature is an indication of the creep-rupture lives of the nickel-based superalloys.  In addition, a manufacturing condition for single-crystal growth was estimated from the measured solidification temperature range of alloys.  All of the six alloys were shown to meet this condition, and their single crystals were grown successfully in agreement with the estimation.

SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB The Co-30 wt.% Cr-xC system was experimentally explored from x = 0 to 2 wt.%, by considering the stable microstructures at 1000, 1100 and 1200 degrees C, and the intervals of fusion. The strengthening potential and the refractoriness of several alloys belonging to this family were specified. Such simple alloys are able to display simultaneously a high amount of chromium for limiting hot corrosion, solidus temperatures as high as 1300 degrees C and refractory carbides fractions that can reach 20% in volume. Natures and fractions of carbides, and solidus temperatures were in good agreements with thermodynamic calculations. Inversely the measured liquidus temperatures were significantly higher than the calculated ones. In addition, thermodynamic modeling allowed to better interpret the disappearance of carbides due to oxidation at high temperature. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI RESEARCH PROGRESS IN A HIGH PERFORMANCE CAST & WROUGHT SUPERALLOY FOR
   TURBINE DISC APPLICATIONS
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB The advanced cast & wrought (C&W) superalloys for turbine disc applications have low temperature bearing capacity and poor processing ability compared with the powder metallurgy (PM) superalloys. Recently, a new kind of C&W Ni-Co base disc superalloys, named as TMW alloy, has been developed on the basis of an innovative concept. Full-scale pancakes (440 mm in diameter and 65 mm in thickness) with an average grain size of about 10 pm were successfully manufactured by a conventional C&W processing route. TMW alloys can provide 58-76 degrees C temperature advantages over alloy U720Li in 0.2% creep strain life under 630 MPa and are comparable with the advanced PM disc superalloys. In this work, the alloy design, preparation processing capacity, micro-structural control, performance characteristics and deformation strengthening mechanisms were briefly introduced.

TI Grain Growth Behaviors of New Ni-Co Base Disk Superalloys during
   Solution Heat Treatment
SO JOURNAL OF THE JAPAN INSTITUTE OF METALS
AB The grain growth behaviors of a new Ni-Co-base superalloy (TMW-4M3) at various temperatures from 1100 degrees C to 1200 degrees C were investigated. The grain grew slowly below solvus temperature, T-s (T-s approximate to 1162 degrees C) and grew very quickly above the temperature because the primary gamma' dissolved completely. Therefore, we suggest that T-s approximate to 1162 degrees C is the gamma' solvus temperature for TMW-4M3 alloy. Meanwhile, below the gamma' solvus temperature, we found that the grain radius, R (pm) was a function of precipitate radius, r(gamma') (mu m) and volume fraction, f(v), of the primary gamma' phase, which could be expressed as,
   R=0.711.4.r(gamma')/integral v
   Thus, the grain growth behavior of the alloy within the gamma' sub-solvus temperature range, showed a good agreement with the Zener model.

TI Effective design of a Co-Ni-Al-W-Ta-Ti alloy with high gamma ' solvus
   temperature and microstructural stability using combined CALPHAD and
   experimental approaches
SO MATERIALS & DESIGN
AB Alloy design of a Co-Ni-Al-W-Ta-Ti senary alloy was performed through a CALPHAD (CALculation of PHAse Diagrams) approach coupled with experimental investigation, with aim to attain high gamma' solvus temperature, microstructural stability, as well as low density. The results of the thermodynamic calculations indicated that increasing the Ni content would broaden the gamma + gamma' two-phase region, meanwhile simultaneously increasing the Ni content and the Al/W ratio would lead to high gamma' solvus temperature and microstructural stability. The experimental results indicated that a high Al/W ratio with a high Ni content of > 20 at.% was beneficial not only for obtaining a high gamma' solvus temperature, but also for realizing high microstructural stability and low density in these Co-Al-W-base superalloys. Increasing the Ni content enhanced the hardness of both the gamma and gamma' phases, while increasing the AIM ratio had an opposite effect. The optimized alloy, Co-30Ni-11Al-4W-1Ta-4Ti (at.%), demonstrated solvus temperature of above 1200 degrees C, low density of 8.76 g/cm(3), and excellent microstructural stability after aging at 1150 degrees C for 1000 h. This study will be helpful for the continuous efforts on the development of Co-Al-W-base superalloys for industrial application, as well as populating thermodynamic databases. (C) 2019 The Authors.

TI Segregation assisted microtwinning during creep of a polycrystalline
   L1(2)-hardened Co-base superalloy
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB A polycrystalline L1(2)-hardened Co-base superalloy was creep deformed at 750 degrees C. The investigation of the deformed microstructure in the transmission electron microscope revealed microtwinning to be the prevailing deformation mechanism. The detected twins spanned the entire grain and cut through both, gamma and gamma'. Detailed high-resolution transmission electron microscopy investigations indicated that twin growth takes place by the slip of single a/6 (112) partial dislocations along the twin boundary. Further analysis of the twin boundaries in the gamma' phase revealed segregation of elements known to decrease the stacking fault energy and a local depletion of gamma' forming elements. We propose that this segregation behavior enables subsequent a/6 < 112 > dislocations to easily slip along the twin boundary and further thicken the twins in the process.

Based on the Co3Ta binary system, which is a promising L1(2) (gamma') strengthened compound, the effects of alloying element X (X = Ru, Rh, Pd, Re, Ir and Pt) on the thermal stability and mechanical property were investigated. The temperature effect is taken into account in the framework of quasi-harmonic Debye theory. According to the present results, Ru and Rh are the promising alloying elements to improve the stability of gamma'-Co3Ta compound against its competitive phase D0(19). Particularly, Ru and Rh exhibit improved performance of both mechanical strengthening and structural stabilization. There theoretical predictions in terms of the thermodynamic stability of Co-Ta-X (Ru and Ru) compounds were experimentally verified. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

High resolution X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to relate the elemental partitioning behavior and the Vegard coefficients of the elements under investigation to the measured lattice parameter of the gamma and gamma' phase. The residual chemical segregation and especially the coherency stress-induced tetragonal distortion of the gamma matrix lattice in the high Mo containing alloys results in the observation of two different lattice parameters for the gamma matrix phase. This leads to three overlapping, but clearly distinguishable {002} X-ray reflections.

SO OXIDATION OF METALS
AB Two {M-25Cr}-based alloys, with M = Co or Ni, containing 0.5C and 3.9Nb (wt%) to favor the crystallization of NbC carbides during solidification were prepared by casting and then subjected to oxidation in air at 1000, 1100 and 1200 A degrees C for 46 h. The results were studied by comparison with recent similar ones obtained with Nb-free ternary alloys issued from the same preparation protocol and tested in oxidation in the same conditions. In both cases interdendritic script-like-shaped NbC carbides were obtained as expected, however, not as single carbides in the nickel alloy which also contain chromium carbides. Preliminary exposure to 1200 A degrees C having shown a morphological evolution of the NbC, as-cast and preliminarily aged versions of both alloys were tested in oxidation. It appeared first that, whatever the aged state, the cobalt alloy behaved much worse than the nickel one, that the presence of Nb deteriorated the behavior in both cases and that aging the alloys, which resulted in NbC fragmentation, was also detrimental for the high-temperature oxidation behavior.

TI Microstructure evolution in L1(2) hardened Co-base superalloys during
   creep
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS RESEARCH
AB The plastic deformation mechanisms and the microstructure development during creep deformation of L1(2)-hardened Co-base superalloys show a number of unique features. The preferred orientation of rafting is determined by their positive lattice mismatch. In addition, the regular interfacial dislocation networks often found in rafted specimens of other types of superalloys do not form. While the ordered gamma'-L1(2) precipitates are supposed to harden the material, they are actually found to be frequently cut by partial dislocations generating stacking faults. In this work, specimens from creep tests interrupted at different strains were investigated using transmission and scanning electron microscopy. By this, it is possible to find out which of these processes take place in which stage of creep deformation. For a better understanding of creep deformation, the balance between gamma' cutting and dislocation activity within the matrix channels is of special interest.

AB With the goals of exploring the feasibility of improving the yield strength without decreasing the hot workability, four novel Co-30Ni-(7-x)Al-2W-1.5Mo-1Ta-(3.5 + y)Ti-12Cr-0.1Hf-0.08C-0.08B-0.4Si-0.01Zr (x = 0, 1, 1.5, 3, y = 0, 0, 0.7, 1.4 at%) gamma'-strengthened wrought Co-base superalloys were designed, and the effects of Al and Ti on microstructure and properties of gamma'-strengthened wrought Co-base superalloys were analyzed. Comparing the alloys 7Al-3.5Ti, 5.5Al-4.2Ti and 4Al-4.9Ti with the similar hot workability, the Al(at%)/Ti(at%) in the gamma' decreased with the decrease of Al(at%)/Ti(at%) in the alloys, this composition change in the gamma' made the alloys' yield strength at room temperature and 800 degrees C increase from 915 MPa to 1025 MPa and from 764 MPa to 826 MPa, respectively. Based on the 6Al-3.5Ti alloy, the addition of 1 at% Al changed the gamma' compositions, which resulted in a decrease of yield strength at room temperature by 45 MPa but a significant increase of yield strength by 108 MPa at 800 degrees C, and this significant increase of yield strength at 800 degrees C may also be associated with the formation of numerous microtwins in 7Al-3.5Ti alloy; In the four experimental alloys, Mo preferentially partitions to the gamma matrix, the relative content of Al and Ti has a negligible influence on the hot deformation resistance at 1150 degrees C, and there is no harmful phase after a heat treatment of 900 degrees C at 8 h + 750 degrees C at 12 h.

Lattice parameter misfit values and the difference in phase stiffnesses at room temperature, 650 degrees C, and 900 degrees C are presented. These microstructural parameters should assist in refining computer models that aim to predict precipitate evolution in superalloys and aid future alloy design. The nature of rafting is shown experimentally to be dependent upon the lattice parameter misfit.

TI Primary Microstructure Characterization of As-Casted Co-20Ni-7Al-7W
   Superalloy
SO ARCHIVES OF FOUNDRY ENGINEERING
AB The primary microstructure of new Co-based superalloy of Co-20Ni-7Al-7W (at.%) type was showed in this article. The alloy was manufactured by induction melting in vacuum furnaces. This alloy is a part of new group of high-temperature materials based on Co solid solution and strengthened by coherent L1(2) phase similar to Ni-based superalloys with gamma' phase. The final form of Co-ss/L1(2) microstructure is obtained after fully heat treatment included homogenization, solutionizing and aging processes. But first step of heat treatment thermal parameters determination is characterization of primary microstructure of alloys after casting process with special attentions on segregations of alloying elements in solid solution and presences of structural elements such as eutectic areas, and other phases precipitations. In analysed case the relatively high homogeneity of chemical composition was expected especially in the case of W distribution, what was confirmed be SEM/EDS analysis in dendritic and interdendritic areas.

AB The effect of elemental interactions between solute elements on diffusion in Ni-X-Y (X, Y: Al, Ti, Nb, Ta, Cr, Co, Mo, W, Re, Ru) systems and gamma'-coarsening in model Ni-based superalloys are investigated by performing first principles calculations and high-temperature thermal exposure experiments. The ternary interactions are important for the diffusion barrier of a solute in Ni-X-Y and the coarsening rate of precipitates.

   temperature oxidation of M-30Cr-xC alloys (M=Co, Ni, Fe). Part I: Study
   of the parabolic constants and of the chromia volatilization rates
SO ANNALES DE CHIMIE-SCIENCE DES MATERIAUX
AB The oxidation kinetics of twelve simple alloys, cobalt-base, nickel-base and iron-base, were studied at 1000, 1100 and 1200 degrees C. Ni-base, Fe-base (and Co-base only at 1000 degrees C and 1100 degrees C for some of them) alloys oxidize following a parabolic-type law, which was, in each case, analyzed according to d(Delta m/S)/dt as a function of 1/(Delta m/S). This allowed getting both the parabolic constant Kp and the chromia-volatilization constant Kv. These are equal to the slope and to the opposite of the ordinate at the origin of the obtained straight line, respectively. The Fe-base alloys oxidize faster than the Ni-base alloys, with sometimes a value of Kv which is really different from the former at the same temperature. The Co-base alloys are more prone to a catastrophic linear oxidation when T is higher than 1000 degrees C. Fortunately, a high density of interdendritic chromium carbides can lead to an improved behaviour.

TI Effect of Ta and Ti on the solidification characteristics of novel

SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB The effects of Ta and Ti on the microstructure, segregation and solidification path of Co-7A1-8W-base alloy were investigated using directional solidification quenching experiments and isothermal solidification quenching experiments. The results showed that the as-cast microstructure of the Co-7Al-8W alloy (Base alloy) is the gamma single phase. The Al element slightly segregates to the interdendritic regions, the W element slightly segregates to the dendritic core, and Co has almost no segregation. The solidification path of the Co-7Al-8W-4Ti alloy is L -> L-1+gamma -> L-2+gamma+(beta+gamma')(e) -> L-3+gamma+(beta+gamma')(e)+gamma'->gamma+(beta+gamma')(e)+gamma', After the addition of 1 at.% Ti, there is no change in the segregation of elements, the microstructure and the solidification path of the alloy. The Ta element strongly segregates to the interdendritic regions in the Co-7Al-8W-1Ta alloy. With the addition of 4 at.% Ti, the Ti element strongly segregates to the interdendritic regions, and the segregation of Al and W elements increases. Blocky gamma' phase and (beta+y')(e) eutectics form in the interdendritic regions. The solidification path of the Co-7Al-8W-4Ti alloy is L -> L-1+gamma -> L-2+gamma+(beta+Y')(e) -> L-3+gamma+(beta+gamma')(e)+gamma' ->gamma+(beta+gamma')(e)+y', After the addition of 1 at.% Ta+4 at.% Ti, the segregation of Al, Ta and Ti decreases, while the segregation of W increases. Laves phase, blocky gamma' phase and ((beta+y')e eutectics form in the interdendritic regions. The solidification path of the Co-7A1-8W-1Ta-4Ti alloy is L -> L-1+gamma -> L-2+gamma+Laves -> L-3+gamma+Laves+(beta+gamma')(e) -> L-4+gamma+Laves+(beta+gamma')(e)+gamma' -> gamma+Laves+(beta+gamma')(e)+gamma'. The above results could provide an experimental basis for composition optimization and solidification process control of novel gamma'-strengthened Co-base superalloys. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Co-based HAYNES(R) 25(TM) and 188(TM) alloys have been studied to determine the effect of shock-loading on the post-shock quasi-static and dynamic mechanical response, and microstructural evolution. The compression properties of these materials were studied in both the as-received and shock-loaded conditions at strain rates from 10(-3)/s to 3000/s, and 77 and 293K. Isochronal annealing treatments were conducted at temperatures ranging from 300 to 800 degrees C, following the shock-loading. For annealing temperatures below 600 degrees C, the reload yield strengths and strain hardening rates were found to increase relative to the as-shocked condition, and only at temperatures above 600 degrees C was the expected softening observed. The microstructural changes responsible for these differences in mechanical properties were documented via TEM.

TI High temperature properties and fatigue strength of novel wrought

SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS RESEARCH
AB This paper presents the high temperature yield and fatigue strength as well as thermophysical properties of two polycrystalline wrought gamma/gamma' Co-base superalloys developed for application in a temperature regime above 700 degrees C. The alloys CoW Alloy1 (Co42Ni32Cr12Al6W3Ti2.5Ta1.5 1 Si,C,B,Zr,Hf) and CoW Alloy2 (Co41Ni32Cr12Al9W5 1 Ti,Ta,Si,C,B,Zr,Hf) exhibited solidus temperatures of 1070 degrees C and 1030 degrees C, respectively, and a gamma' fraction of about 50%. CoW Alloy2 displayed a rather high Young's modulus of 250 GPa. The two Co-base superalloys showed a good high temperature strength exceeding Ni-base disc alloys U720Li and Waspaloy at temperatures above 800 degrees C. When comparing the yield strength from tensile and compression tests, no asymmetry could be found. The low-cycle fatigue life of CoW Alloy2 at a total strain amplitude of 0.5% is similar to that of U720Li and Waspaloy (about 370 cycles, R = -1). During long-term aging for 1024 h at 750 degrees C, no additional phases were formed and the room temperature hardness barely changed.

AB Microstructural instability involving the formation of topologically close-packed (TCP) phases is restricted during the alloy development of Ni-based single crystal superalloys. In this study, the effects of alloying elements including Co, Cr, Mo and Ru on the formation of different TCP phases were investigated in a series of single crystal superalloys. Experimental results showed that more additions of Cr and Mo promoted the TCP phase formation, while Co and Ru played a positive role in improving microstructural stability. It is indicated that sigma, P and R phases existed with various morphology and compositions in different experimental alloys during thermal exposure at 1100 degrees C. The content of Co, Cr and Mo in those alloys affected the types of TCP phases significantly, while Ru additions showed a negligible effect. R phase was prone to form in alloys containing high level of Co addition. Meanwhile, the ratio of Cr and Mo content had strong influence on the formation of sigma and P phases in alloys containing low level of Co addition. The effects of alloying additions on the elemental partitioning ratios between gamma and gamma' phases contributed to their corresponding influence on TCP phase formation.

TI Measurement of the densities of nickel-based ternary, quaternary and

SO MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS
AB The modified sessile drop method (MSDM) and the modified pycnometric method (MPM) have been employed to measure precisely the densities of liquid nickel-based ternary (Ni-Co-Al) and quaternary (Ni-Co-Al-Cr, Ni-Co-Al-Mo, Ni-Cr-Al-Mo) alloys and four commercial superalloys in liquid and mushy states. There was a good agreement between the values measured by the two methods. The measured densities of liquid model alloys and commercial superalloys in liquid and mushy states decreased linearly with increasing temperature for the experimental temperature range. The temperature coefficient of the density of liquid ternary Ni-Co-Al alloys measured in this work can be represented as a quadratic function of the aluminium concentration in the alloys. The density of liquid Ni-Co-Al alloys can be expressed as a function of both temperature and aluminium concentration in the alloys. The recommended equations for the densities of liquid nickel-based ternary and quaternary alloys and four commercial superalloys in liquid and mushy states were obtained by analysing density values measured by both MSDM and MPM. The calculated values from the recommended density equations show good agreement with those measured by both MSDM and MPM.

TI Effect of temperature and reactivity of molten 55Al-Zn alloy on Co based
   alloy coatings
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The short service life of bearings in galvanising industry is a result of a complex set of deterioration mechanisms. This work addressed the effect of temperature and molten bath reactivity on the material of the bearings respectively. Three commercial alloys, the Co-Cr-W Stellite 6 and Co-Cr-Mo-Si Tribaloy (T400 and T800) alloy systems, were deposited by plasma transferred arc on AISI 316L plates. Coatings were evaluated for the effect of temperature exposure on hardness, microstructure and sliding abrasive wear. The reactivity with the molten 55Al-Zn alloy was assessed by immersion tests in an industrial bath. Results showed that exposure at 600 degrees C for 168 h resulted in an increase in hardness, microstructure changes and loss of wear resistance for the Stellite 6 coatings. A superior performance to temperature was shown by Tribaloy T800 with a stable abrasive wear resistance. The three alloys exhibited a strong reactivity with the 55Al-Zn molten bath. An intermetallic layer formed on the coatings as the Al from the bath reacted with elements from the Co based alloys. This reactivity consumed the coatings, causing a reduction on thickness particularly on those processed with the T800 alloy.

AB This paper presents recent progress on the phase diagrams and design for Co-base alloys, focusing on magnetic recording media, ferromagnetic Co-Ni-Al-base shape memory alloys, half-metallic Heusler alloys and Co-base superalloys. The calculated miscibility gap between ferromagnetic and paramagnetic states in the Co-X(X: Cr, Mo, W) systems has been found to agree well with the experimental results, strongly implying that the magnetic induced phase separation is responsible for the compositional heterogeneity in Co-base magnetic recording media. New ferromagnetic Co-Ni-Al shape memory alloys have also been developed based on phase diagrams, where the introduction of gamma(Al structure) to the beta(B2) matrix was found to drastically improve the ductility. The phase stability of half-metal Heusler Co-Cr base alloys is discussed in relation to the order-disorder transition, Curie temperature and the spin polarization ratio. Finally, the possibility of potent strengthening of Co-base superalloys by precipitation of the gamma'(L1(2)) phase is presented.

TI THERMODYNAMIC STUDY ON EQUILIBRIUM PRECIPITATION PHASES IN A NOVEL Ni-Co
   BASE SUPERALLOY
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB Thermodynamic properties of the traditional U720Li alloy and the new Ni-Co base superalloy have been studied using JMatPro and the latest relevant database for Ni base superalloys. The effects of chemical composition on the equilibrium precipitation phases, process-ability and gamma/gamma' mismatch have been analyzed. It is found that the gamma/gamma' mismatch increases with the increase of Ti/Al (atomic ratio). The volume fraction of gamma' is proportional to the Ti+Al contents (atomic fraction). Therefore, by increasing the Ti/Al ratio and Ti+Al content, the yield strength of alloys can be improved. On the other hand, the gamma' solvus temperature decreases by Co additions. As a result, the range of processing temperature is extended. The gamma/gamma' mismatch also increases with Co additions, which adds additional strengthening to the alloy. Moreover, high Ti/Al ratio or low Co content promotes the precipitation of eta phase. Thus, Ni-Co base superalloys with high Ti+Al content, Ti/Al ratio and Co content bear an improved strength, phase stabilities and process-ability.

TI Effect of Pre-Oxidation on High Temperature Oxidation and Corrosion
   Behavior of Co-Al-W-Based Superalloy
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB In 2006, stable gamma' phase was found in Co-Al-W alloy, which provides a new way for developing Co-based superalloys. In order to meet the requirements for applications, the Co-Al-W-based superalloys need to have good oxidation and corrosion resistance. But the oxidation and corrosion resistance of the Co-Al-W-based superalloys is relatively low. In this work, pre-oxidation treatments were to improve the oxidation and corrosion resistance. Three types of pre-oxidation treatments were carried out at 900 degrees C (in air), 950 degrees C (in air) and 1000 degrees C (in 1%O-2 +99%Ar), which were marked as 900-PreO, 950-PreO and 1000-LPreO, respectively. High temperature oxidation tests of both the pre-oxidation treated and untreated superalloys were carried out at 1000 degrees C. And hot corrosion behaviors were also investigated at both 800 and 850 degrees C. XRD, SEM and EDS were used to examine the characteristics of the oxidation and corrosion behaviors. The results show that the pre-oxide layers of the superalloys after different pre-oxidation treatments are compact. During oxidation at 1000 degrees C, the Cr2O3 scale in 900-PreO treated superalloy is oxidized to form volatile products, and the diffusion resistance of both oxygen and the metal elements through the oxide layer is poor. In 1000-LPreO treated superalloy, serious spallation of the oxides occurs and leads to poor oxidation resistance. In 950-PreO treated superalloy, since the continuous CoCr2O4 and Al2O3 scales help to reduce the diffusion of oxygen and the metal elements, the mass gain of 950-PreO treated superalloy is consequently decreased. During the hot corrosion process, the preoxide layer of 950-PreO treated superalloy can hinder the diffusion of corrosive medium. Therefore, the corrosion resistance can be significantly improved by 950-PreO treatment, and the mass gain is decreased by over 80%.

TI Protection of cobalt-based refractory alloys by chromium deposition on
   surface Part II: Behaviour of the coated alloys in oxidation at high
   temperature
SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB A high chromium content, typically 30 wt.%, is generally considered as necessary for cobalt-based alloys to allow them to resist oxidation by hot gases. Cobalt alloys with a bulk poorer in chromium may become resistant against high temperature oxidation if they are enriched in chromium on surface.The aim of this second part of the work is to expose to air at 1200 degrees C three low-chromium cobalt-based alloys (Co-10Cr, Co-10Cr-0.25C-4.4Ta and Co-10Cr-0.5C-8.7Ta in wt.%), previously enriched in chromium on surface by pack cementation, in order to examine if the applied cementation treatments are enough to ensure a good behaviour for a long time. The initial surface enrichment in chromium of the Ta-containing alloys, characterized by a maximal content on surface of about 30 wt.% Cr and a depth of enrichment of several hundreds of micrometers, gives them a good resistance to oxidation at 1200 degrees C, despite the very low-chromium content in the bulk. This is also due to the interdendritic TaC carbides which may facilitate outward diffusion of chromium during oxidation as they facilitated its inward diffusion during cementation. In contrast. the CoCr alloy, enriched in chromium in the same conditions did not display a so good oxidation behaviour. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB First-principles DFT methods are combined with an experimental approach to characterize the creep behavior of quinary Co-based L1(2)-containing superalloys at elevated temperature conditions. Temperature-dependent SISF energies have been modeled, combining 0 K formation energies with vibrational free energy calculations to assess deformation mechanisms at finite temperature. Two different Co-Al-W alloys, containing the maximum possible amount of DFT-identified d-block alloying additions, were identified and cast as single crystals via the Bridgman process. Creep tests have been performed at two primary testing conditions, one at 900 degrees C and the other at 982 degrees C. Transmission scanning electron microscopy (TSEM) was performed at 30 kV in a scanning electron microscope to rapidly characterize the defect substructures. We observe a coupled APB/SISF/APB defect structure in Co-based superalloys at the low-temperature condition, similar to the defect structure observed in CoNi, in spite of containing no Ni. At 982 degrees C, there is no evidence of faults and precipitates instead contain antiphase boundaries. The role of composition and temperature-dependent fault energies in the deformation process is addressed.

TI Ductility enhancement by boron addition in Co-Al-W high-temperature

SO SCRIPTA MATERIALIA
AB The mechanical properties of several B-free and B-doped Co-Al-W superalloys with different volume fractions of the CO3(Al,W)-gamma' phase were examined by mechanical tests at various temperatures up to 980 degrees C. Although grain boundary fracture occurred in the B-free alloys, the addition of a small amount of B drastically improved the ductility. It was also confirmed that the positive temperature dependence of strength was strongly affected not only by the volume fraction of the gamma' phase, but also by the addition of B.

TI High-strength Co-Al-V-base superalloys strengthened by gamma
   '-Co-3(Al,V) with high solvus temperature
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB The gamma/gamma' two-phase Co Al V-base superalloys are investigated in detail, including their phase equilibria, alloying effects, and alloy design. The experimental proof of the existence of a ternary compound with an L1(2)-ordered gamma'-Co-3(Al, V) phase is provided in this study, and the gamma/gamma' two-phase Co-5Al-14V (at.%) alloy is designed. The gamma'-Co-3(Al,V) phase is proved to be thermodynamically stable at 900 degrees C, and a wide gamma/gamma' two-phase composition region in the Co-Al-V ternary phase diagram at 900 degrees C is identified. The performed investigation of Co-5Al-14V-2X (X: Ti, Cr, Nb, Mo, Ta, and W) and Co-xNi-8Al-12V (x = 10, 20, and 30) quaternary alloys revealed that Ti, Nb, Mo, Ta, W, and Ni tend to concentrate in the gamma' phase, whereas Cr tends to partition to the gamma matrix. Besides, the gamma/gamma' two-phase Co-30Ni-10Al-5V-4Ta-2Ti (30Ni4Ta2Ti) alloy is designed. The 30Ni4Ta2Ti alloy exhibits a very high gamma' solvus temperature (namely, 1242 +/- 3 degrees C) combined with a low density (8.46 +/- 0.08 g cm(-3)), which characteristics are comparable with those of the Mar-M-247 Ni-base superalloy. Moreover, the nominal and the specific yield strength values of the obtained 30Ni4Ta2Ti alloy within the temperature range from 600 to 900 degrees C are also close to those of the Mar-M-247 superalloy.

TI Site preference and interaction energies of Co and Cr in gamma prime
   Ni3Al: a first-principles study
SO MODELLING AND SIMULATION IN MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
AB Nickel-based superalloys are critical for aerospace and power applications due to excellent high-temperature properties. These high-temperature properties are attributed to the coherently precipitated gamma prime phase in the gamma matrix. The segregation of alloying elements between the matrix and the gamma prime phase drives precipitate misfit strains and impacts material strength. This study aims at understanding the site preference of Co and Cr within the ordered gamma prime phase. The study also calculates the interaction energy between alloying additions within the ternary systems Ni-Al-Cr and Ni-Al-Co, and the quaternary system Ni-Al-Cr-Co. It is found that Co has mixed substitution behavior between the Al and Ni sites in the gamma prime phase. The results from the Ni-Al-Cr ternary system show that two Cr atoms prefer being close to each other, with the most stable configuration of the first nearest neighbors of the Al-Al site. The interaction energies calculated from the Ni-Al-Co system show that the initial distance between two Co atoms will decide whether the two Co atoms prefer Ni-Ni or Ni-Al configuration. The study on the quaternary system Ni-Al-Cr-Co reveals that the initial configuration of Cr and Co atoms will affect the final most stable configuration. The results are found to be consistent with our previous findings.

TI Thin-walled high temperature alloy structures fabricated from additively
   manufactured polymer templates
SO MATERIALS & DESIGN
AB Additive manufacturing is enabling a paradigm shift in design and production, but conventional techniques reach their limits when metallic structures require walls with <0.5 mm thickness. Here we introduce an approach for indirect additive manufacturing of thin-walled alloy structures. First a polymer template is additively manufactured, then metal layers are deposited by electroplating, physical or chemical vapor deposition. After removal of the polymer, the metal layers can be interdiffused to form an alloy via homogenization heat treatments. Three different alloys designed for three elevated temperature regimes are demonstrated: Monel alloys based on Ni-Cu-Al-Ti, nickel superalloys based on Ni-Cr-Al and refractory rhenium alloys based on Re-Co. A process was developed to co-deposit rhenium and cobalt via aqueous electroplating, resulting in an alloy with a melting point of 2000 degrees C and a Vickers hardness of 480 +/- 50 HV0.2 after homogenization. Two applications of interest for the aerospace industry were chosen to demonstrate the technology. High temperature truss core sandwich structures and rocket engine thruster demos where fabricated.

TI Phase stability and yield stress of Ni-base superalloys containing high
   Co and Ti
SO METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND
   MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Ni-base superalloys containing high Co (> 20 wt pet) and Ti (> 5.5 wt pet) were designed in order to study the effects of Co16.9 wt pet Ti addition on phase stability and mechanical property. These new alloys, though they contained high Ti, mainly consisted of gamma and gamma' phases. Ni3Ti (eta) phase was observed along the grain boundaries in some of the alloys. The formation of eta phase was mainly related to the Ti/Al ratio, Ti content, and alloy composition. Tensile and compression tests showed that these new alloys exhibited higher yield stress than that of the baseline alloy, TMW-1(U720LI). The possible strengthening mechanisms were discussed in terms of solid-solution and precipitation strengthening effects by the Co16.9 wt pet Ti additions. Preliminary results show promising trends for the development of new superalloys for turbine disc applications.

TI Accelerating exploitation of Co-Al-based superalloys from theoretical
   study
SO MATERIALS & DESIGN
AB The discovery of gamma'-Co-3(Al,W) opens up a pathway to exploit novel Co-Al-based alloys as candidates of the next generation of superalloys. Inspired by the unexpected finding of gamma'-Co-3(Al,W), we present a comprehensive investigation concerning the effect of alloying elements on phase stabilities and mechanical properties of Co3Al. Up to 22 transition metal elements, e.g. Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Y, Zr, Nb, Mo, Tc, Ru, Rh, Pd, Hf, Ta, W, Re, Os, Ir, and Pt are considered. Results show that W, Ti, Re, V, and Ta favor to occupy the Al-sublattice. Pd, Pt, Rh, Ni, It, Fe, and Ru favor to occupy the Co-sublattice. The others can occupy both the Co-and Al-sublattices. W, Ta, V, Ti, Nb, Re, Mo, Pt, and Cr are shown to stabilize Co3Al. It verifies that elastic properties are roughly in inverse proportional to the volume change induced by alloying elements within each group of 3d, 4d, or 5d. Based on the analysis of electronic configurations, the influence mechanism of alloying elements is traceable from the chemical bonding and the geometry of charge density. The present calculations are in favorable accord with available experimental data in the literature. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI MICROSTRUCTURES AND PARTITIONING RATIOS OF ALLOYING ELEMENTS IN RHENIUM
   CONTAINING NICKEL-BASED SINGLE-CRYSTAL SUPERALLOYS
SO TETSU TO HAGANE-JOURNAL OF THE IRON AND STEEL INSTITUTE OF JAPAN
AB In order to obtain some criteria for determining the optimum compositions of rhenium (Re) containing nickel-based single crystal superalloys, the phase stability and the partition ratios of alloying elements between gamma and gamma' phases were investigated using the Ni-10Cr-12Al-1.2Ti-2.6Ta-2.0W-0.7Mo-0 approximately 1Re (mol%) alloys.  Most of Re atoms were found to be distributed mainly in the gamma phase and alter significantly the partition ratios of the other elements between gamma and gamma' phases.  It was shown that the decrease of Cr, Ta, W, Mo contents and the increase of Al content were most desirable in the design of alloys containing more than 0.25 mol% Re.  Further, in order to investigate the possibility Co addition into the Re containing alloys, its effects on the phase stability and the partition ratios of elements were examined with the Ni-10Cr-12Al-1.5Ti-2.1Ta-2.3W-0.8Mo-0.25Re (mol%) alloys in which 0 approximately 9 mol% Co was substituted for Ni.  It became evident from the present experiment that the Co substitution for Ni did not induce any large changes in the phase stability and also in the partition ratios of the alloying elements in this system.

TI Elemental site occupancy in the L1(2) A(3)B ordered intermetallic phase
   in Co-based superalloys and its influence on the microstructure
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB We explore the effects of the elemental site occupancy in gamma'-A3B (L1(2)) intermetallic phases and their partitioning across the gamma/gamma' interface in a class of multicomponent W-free Co-based superalloys. Atom probe tomography and first principles density functional theory calculations (DFT) were used to evaluate the Cr site occupancy behavior in the gamma' phase and its effect on the gamma/gamma' partitioning behavior of other solutes in a series of Co-30Ni-10Al-5Mo-2Ta-2Ti-XCr alloys, where x is 0, 2, 5, and 8 at.% Cr, respectively. The increase in Cr content from 0 to 2 to 5 at.% leads to an inversion of the partitioning behavior of the solute Mo from the gamma' phase (K-Mo > 1) into the gamma matrix (K-Mo < 1). At 5 at.% Cr, the Cr also has a preference to replace the excess anti-site Co atoms from the B-sites. At 8 at.% Cr, the Cr develops an additional preference to replace Co atoms from the A-sites. These compositional changes in the phases and the site partitioning behavior in the gamma' phase are accompanied by an overall decrease in the lattice misfit (delta) across the gamma/gamma' interfaces as measured by high-resolution X-ray diffraction at room temperature. The reduction in misfit triggers a change in morphology of the gamma' phase from cuboidal (delta similar to +0.48% at 0 at.% Cr) to round-cornered (delta similar to +0.34% at 5 at.% Cr) to spheroidal shaped (delta similar to +0.19% at 8 at.% Cr) precipitates. We also observed an increase in the solvus temperature from 1066 degrees C to 1105 degrees C when adding 5 at.% Cr to the alloy. These results on the effects of Cr in Co-base superalloys enable tuning the microstructure of these alloys and widening the alloy spectrum for designing improved high temperature alloys.

TI An optimization algorithm and its application for predicting elemental
   concentrations of sublattices of gamma ' phase in Ni base superalloys
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB The effects of mismatch in atomic size and electronegativity of alloying elements on the elemental concentration of sublattices of gamma' phase in Ni base superalloys were investigated. The mathematic model of optimizations was established to predict the elemental concentration of sublattices of gamma' phase. Ranges of the selected values of concentration variables were determined by use of the iterative and substitutional method. Based on chemical compositions of the gamma' phase, the elemental content at the Ni and Al sites in the gamma' phase can be calculated with the layered multi-objective optimization algorithm with tolerance. Using the reported data on both the chemical compositions and the lattice parameters of gamma' phase, a comparison between the predicted and the reported values of lattice parameters was made through the application of the predicted values of the elemental concentrations of the gamma' sublattices to verify the feasibility and the accuracy of the present method.

SO OXIDATION OF METALS
AB The role of refractory metals on the bare oxidation behaviour of a range of compositionally complex single crystal Ni-base superalloys has been investigated using a range of techniques. It has been shown that this series of fourth generation alloys were borderline alumina formers at 1,100 A degrees C, and their cyclic oxidation performance was detrimentally affected by increased levels of Mo and Co. In addition, there was strong evidence that Re, Ru and Mo were lost through the process of cyclic oxidation, which supports the hypothesis that these elemental additions were lost through volatilisation/sublimation, contributing to their poor cyclic oxidation performance.

TI Influence of Iridium on the Properties of gamma '-Strengthened Co-Base
   Superalloys
SO ADVANCED ENGINEERING MATERIALS
AB The influence of iridium on the phase stability, oxidation behavior, and high temperature creep strength of -hardened Co-base superalloys is discussed. Ir increases the -solvus temperature and -volume fraction since it partitions slightly to the -phase. However, Ir leads also to a discontinuous precipitation transformation of the metastable /-microstructure into a lamellar microstructure of Co3W, CoAl, and a Co-rich fcc phase for the W-rich alloys. A reduction of W in presence of Ir leads to a higher phase stability. The constrained lattice misfit between the and phase in the Ir and high W containing alloy is +0.5%. The alloying element Ir strongly increases the creep strength at 850 degrees C as long as the /-microstructure is not discontinuously transformed. Furthermore, the oxidation resistance is improved by the addition of iridium.

TI Assessing the kinetics and mechanisms of corrosion of cast and HIPed
   Stellite 6 in aqueous saline environments
SO CORROSION SCIENCE
AB Cobalt-base (Stellite) alloys have seen extensive use in wear environments mainly due to their high strength, corrosion resistance and hardness. Co-base superalloys rely primarily on carbides, formed in the Co matrix and at grain boundaries, for their strength and the distribution, size and shape of carbides depends on processing conditions. Currently use of Stellite alloys has extended into various industrial sectors (e.g. pulp and paper processing, oil and gas processing, pharmaceuticals, chemical processing) and the need for improved information regarding corrosion (and often tribo-corrosion) of Stellite alloys has increased. It has been recognised that processing changes, which affect the microstructure of Stellite alloys, will most probably affect the corrosion performance.
   In this paper the corrosion behaviour of Stellite 6 in the as-cast and the HIP consolidated forms has been compared and contrasted using DC electrochemical techniques in static saline conditions. It has been shown that there is a significant difference in the corrosion performance of HIP consolidated Stellite 6 and it is possible to link the corrosion mechanisms to the microstructure. The benefits of using HIPing as a manufacturing process for the corrosion performance of Stellite 6 are discussed. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The current work characterizes the microstructure and mechanical properties of two arc melted Co-Ni-based superalloys containing in atomic percent: 1) Co-40Ni-10Al-7.5W-10Cr-3Ta-0.0613-0.6 C and 2) Co-40Ni-10Al-7.5W-10Cr-3Nb-0.0613-0.6 C. These two materials named 3Ta and 3Nb, respectively, were characterized by X-Ray diffraction analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy, electron backscatter diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. Furthermore, compression tests were performed from room temperature up to 1000 degrees C. The 3Ta and 3Nb alloys showed different as-cast microstructures that were confirmed by microstructural characterization and Scheil simulations. The phase transformation temperatures of minor phases were measured and calculated using a thermodynamic approach and some discrepancies observed on the calculated gamma'-solvus temperatures reflect that the thermodynamic description of gamma' phase does not take into account the strong partition effect of Ta, Nb and Ti into gamma'. As shown by DSC results, the gamma' phase was stable for both alloys up to 1000 degrees C, being the main reason for the 3Ta and 3Nb alloys to keep the yield stress above 500 MPa.

SO PHILOSOPHICAL MAGAZINE
AB Using new supercells, the influence of the alloying elements Co, Cr, Ta, Re, and Ru on the elastic properties of ternary and quaternary nickel-base superalloys are systematically studied by the first-principles pseudopotential method. The calculated results of the five ternary and three quaternary superalloys suggest that the alloying elements can increase the elastic moduli. Re is found to be most effective in increasing the moduli of ternary alloys. Among the quaternary alloys, the Ni-Al-Re-Ru system has the largest moduli. Our calculated values of the elastic moduli agree very well with the experimental results. The charge density redistribution and partial density of states are calculated for the quaternary system including both Re and Ru. Covalent-like bonding between Re and its nearest neighbor is observed. The hybridization between the Re-d orbital and the host Ni-p, d orbitals are the origin of the modulus strengthening effect.

TI Effect of high-temperature protective coatings on fatigue lives of

SO FATIGUE & FRACTURE OF ENGINEERING MATERIALS & STRUCTURES
AB This study concerns MCrAlY coatings (M is Ni, Co or both) sprayed by a vacuum plasma spraying process for protection against high-temperature corrosion and oxidation of gas turbine components, such as turbine blades and duct segments. The effect of high-temperature protective coatings on fatigue lives of nickel-based superalloys were investigated at high temperature under push-pull loading and rotary bending and then compared with uncoated superalloys, such as equiaxed IN738LC, unidirectional solidified CM247LC and single-crystal CMSX-2. The high-cycle fatigue lives of MCrAlY-coated superalloys at high temperature under push-pull loading showed an inferior performance when compared with the uncoated superalloys. This was because the crack initiation site was different. The high-cycle fatigue cracks of nickel-based superalloys initiated at casting cavities which were exposed on the specimen surface, whereas the high-cycle fatigue cracks of MCrAlY-coated specimens initiated at interface defects, such as small pores and grid residue, between the MCrAlY coating and the substrate and grew into the MCrAlY coating, and then into the substrate. Similarly, the rotary bending fatigue properties of MCrAlY-coated superalloys at high temperature showed an inferior performance when compared with the uncoated superalloys. This is because of a high stress due to the higher Young's modulus of the MCrAlY coating (in comparison with the substrate) being induced at the MCrAlY coating surface. The crack initiation site was on the specimen surface in both cases of the nickel-based superalloys and the MCrAlY-coated superalloys, respectively. As a result, it was considered that, for rotary bending tests, the fatigue life reduction was due to the high stress that originated from the difference of elastic constants between the MCrAlY coating and the superalloy. Consequently, in fatigue life design it is necessary to take account of the stress levels in a coating layer.

TI MICROSTRUCTURE, HARDNESS AND INTERFACIAL ENERGY IN Co-9Al-10W-xNi (x=15,
   25, 35 at. %) ALLOYS DURING AGING
SO JOURNAL OF MINING AND METALLURGY SECTION B-METALLURGY
AB In the present paper, three Co-Al-W-Ni alloys (i.e., Co-9Al-10W-xNi with x= 15, 25, 35 at. %) and their heat treatment mechanisms were carefully designed on the basis of the available phase equilibrium information. The temporal evolution of the microstructure and hardness in the Co-9Al-10W-xNi ( x= 15, 25, 35) alloys during aging process was measured, from which the effect of additional Ni contents, aging temperature and time on microstructure and hardness in the three Co-Al-W-Ni alloys was analyzed. Considering that the alloy compositions and heat treatment are not directly related with the hardness, the relationship between hardness and microstructure was then linked. It was found that the hardness of Co-based superalloys increases as the volume fraction of gamma' precipitates increases, while decreases with the increase of the radius and interval of gamma' precipitates. Moreover, the interfacial energy of gamma/gamma' interface was also evaluated on the basis of the coarsening kinetics of gamma' precipitates and the Philippe-Voorhees model in combination with the thermodynamic and atomic mobility databases. The results indicate that the interfacial energies of gamma/gamma' interface reduce as the increase of additional Ni content and aging temperature.

TI Effects of Re, W and Co on dislocation nucleation at the crack tip in
   the gamma-phase of Ni-based single-crystal superalloys by atomistic
   simulation
SO ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE
AB The effects of Re, W and Co on dislocation nucleation at the crack tip in Ni have been studied by the molecular dynamics method. The results show that the activation energy of dislocation nucleation is lowered by the addition of Re, W and Co; moreover, the activation energy decreases when the alloying element increases from 1 at.% to 2 at.%. The energy landscapes of the atoms are studied to elucidate these effects. Quantification analyses of the bonding strength between Ni and X (X = Re, W or Co) reveal that strong bonding between Ni and X (X = Re, W or Co) in the dislocation nucleation process can suppress the cleavage process and enhance the ability of dislocation nucleation. The surface energy and unstable stacking fault energy are also calculated to understand the alloying effects on the dislocation nucleation process. The results imply that interaction between alloying elements and Ni atoms plays a role in promoting the dislocation nucleation process at the crack tip. The ability of Re, W and Co in improving the ductility of the Ni crack system is in the order W. Re. Co. The results could provide useful information in the design of Ni-based superalloys.

TI Kinetics of high temperature oxidation of chromium rich HfC reinforced
   cobalt based alloys
SO CORROSION ENGINEERING SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Mostly known to improve the high temperature oxidation resistance of superalloys, hafnium may also form carbides. Several per cents of Hf allow developing a dense carbide network to mechanically strengthen alloys. Here, the high temperature oxidation behaviour of three HfC containing cobalt alloys was characterised at all steps of a thermogravimetry test: heating, isothermal stage and cooling, compared with two Co-Cr-C model alloys. The five alloys were heated in synthetic air, maintained at 1200 degrees C during 50 h and then cooled. The mass gains were plotted versus time or according to (m x dm/dt=Kp-m x Kv) to specify the isothermal kinetic constants, or versus temperature to determine how oxidation acts during heating and oxide spallation occurs during cooling. Compared to the ternary alloys, the oxidation of the HfC reinforced alloys starts earlier but leads to lower mass gains during heating, the isothermal oxidation is faster and oxide spallation occurs later.

AB A new kind of Ni-Co-base disk alloys, named TMW alloys, has been developed on the basis of our innovative concept. Full-scale pancakes (440 mm in diameter and 65 mm in thickness) with an average grain size of about 10 mu m were successfully manufactured from TMW alloys by a conventional cast-and-wrought (C&W) processing route. The property assessments of the pancakes indicate that TMW alloys are superior to C&W U720Li alloys in tensile strength and in creep resistance, while the performances of low-cycle fatigue (LCF) and fatigue crack growth (FCG) are comparative.

TI Planar defect formation in the gamma' phase during high temperature
   creep in single crystal CoNi-base superalloys
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB The structure and formation mechanism of extended planar defects in the gamma/gamma' microstructure of creep deformed CoNi-base single crystal superalloys have been studied by conventional and advanced transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Planar defects in numerous isolated as well as contiguous gamma' precipitates on 011) planes reveal a characteristic configuration whereby superlattice intrinsic stacking faults (SISF) are fully embedded within antiphase boundaries (APB). Detailed analysis revealed that a leading 1/3[1 12] superpartial dislocation first creates an SISF. The SISF is then transformed into an APB by a trailing 1/6[112] partial dislocation. The partial is left inside the precipitate and remains as a dislocation loop. Thus, the entire shearing process constitutes a crystallographic slip of type 1/2[112]. A force balance analysis indicates that the initial APB energy exceeds the SISF energy. However, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS) indicates pronounced local reordering and diffusion processes near both types of planar defects. The APB qualitatively adopts the composition of the gamma phase whereas the SISF locally changes its composition towards that of the Co3W D0(19) phase. We propose that these atomic diffusion processes determine the formation and shrinkage of the loops. A post mortem in situ TEM heating experiment shows that with increasing temperature the APBs exhibit complete faceting into 000) planes followed by coarsening, eventually leading to disintegration of the gamma' precipitate. This indicates a detrimental impact of APBs as potential nuclei for fragmentation of the gamma/gamma' microstructure in CoNi-base superalloys. (C) 2016 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The tensile creep behavior and microstructural stability of a Co-Al-W-Ta-Ti single-crystal alloy were investigated at 1000 degrees C. Long-term aging at 1000 degrees C for 1000 h revealed stable gamma-gamma' structure with 75% gamma ' volume fraction. The measured positive lattice misfit resulted in directional coarsening parallel to the applied stress during creep. The gamma-gamma' interfacial dislocation networks and shearing of gamma ' precipitates with stacking faults and antiphase boundaries appeared to contribute to the creep resistance with 1.0% creep stain. @ 2014 Acta Materialia Inc.

TI Reactions of Co based and Fe based superalloys with a molten Zn-Al alloy
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Static corrosion tests of Co based and Fe based superalloys were carried out at 470degreesC in a molten Zn galvanising alloy containing about 0(.)22 wt.-%Al and saturated with Fe for various lengths of time up to 168 h (one-week). The superalloys readily reacted with the galvanising alloy and CoAl or Fe2Al5 formed initially on the sample surfaces. The reaction front moved towards the depth of the test pieces with increasing dipping time, leaving behind a Zn rich reaction zone. At the same time, other intermetallic phases formed in the Zn rich zone and on the surfaces of the samples. These intermetallic phases are complex in nature and vary with the alloys. In Stellite 6, Fe aluminide was prominently present in the vicinity of surviving carbide particles in the Zn rich zone of the sample tested for 168 h. Some areas of iron aluminide were intimately connected to Fe2Al5 particles building up on the sample surface. This observation suggests that the iron aluminide formed in the reaction zone provided ideal sites for the attachment of Fe2Al5 particles pre-existing in the melt onto the sample surfaces. It also served as nucleation and growth sites for the (FeAl5)-Al-2 compound on the sample surface. This is one possible mechanism of dross buildup on submerged hardware made of this type of Co based superalloy in continuous galvanising.

   behavior of aluminized nickel-base single crystal superalloys
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB The influences of ruthenium and surface orientation on creep behavior of aluminized Ni-base single crystal superalloys were investigated by comparing two different types of NKH superalloys. The aluminized coated specimens were then subjected to creep rupture tests at a temperature of 900 degrees C and a stress of 392 MPa. The coating treatment resulted in a significant decrease in creep rupture lives for both superalloys. The diffusion zones between the coating and substrate led to changes in microstructure, which diminished the creep behavior of the aluminized superalloys. Because of the interdiffusion of Ru, Al and Ni, the solubility of some of the refractory elements, such as W, Re. Mo, Co and Cr decreased in the diffusion zone; the precipitation of topologically close-packed (TCP) phases was thus inevitable. In the present study, the addition of Ru increased the degree of Re and Cr supersaturation in the gamma matrix. Consequently, the addition of Ru indirectly promoted the precipitation of TCP phases in aluminized Ni-base single crystal superalloys. Furthermore, the growth of TCP precipitates was greatly influenced by the specific surface orientations of the Ni-base single crystal superalloys. In conclusion, the {110} specimens showed shorter creep rupture life than the {100} specimens, this was due to the difference in the crystallographic geometry of {111}< 101 > slip system and TCP precipitates between the two side-surface orientations of the specimens.

SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB The solidification paths, microstructures and mechanical properties of two Co-Al-W base superalloys with different additions of tungsten and molybdenum were investigated. Mo addition does not influence the volume fraction of the gamma' phase; however, the morphology of the gamma' phase changes from cuboidal to near cuboidal. The mu phase and beta phase were identified in both alloy systems. Although the melting point of the mu phase is decreased by Mo addition, the solidification paths remain the same: L -> L-1 + gamma -> L-2 + gamma + mu -> gamma + mu + beta -> gamma + mu + beta + gamma' . The precipitation of a gamma' phase envelop around the interdendritic regions in Co-Al-W alloy systems has never been reported. The formation of a surrounding gamma' phase was caused by the diffusion of elements between secondary phases and the substrate during the heat treatments. The microhardness of the mu phase, which can be easily influenced by Mo addition, is the highest in both alloys, followed by the microhardnesses of the beta phase and the substrate. In the fracturing process, microcracks were generated in the mu phase, the number of which increased with Mo addition.

AB New gamma/gamma' Co-based alloys appear to be a promising set of materials for use in the hottest parts of gas turbines. Recent work has shown that these alloys behave similar to conventional Ni-based superalloys and preliminary designs have produced alloys with remarkable strength at high temperatures. Understanding the behavior of solute elements in these alloys is essential for improving their properties and designing viable alloys. In this work, ab initio simulations are used to study the effects of additional elements on fault energies in the gamma' phase. Initial investigation shows that both Ta and Ti retain a strong preference for the second sub-lattice in the gamma' phase. Calculations also show that these elements increase the superlattice intrinsic stacking fault energy of the gamma' precipitates while promoting the stability of the gamma' phase relative to other crystal structures. This work indicates that the stability and resistance to dislocation penetration of the gamma' phase in these alloys are closely linked and are strongly affected by chemical bonding rather than the size of solute atoms.

TI First-principles modeling of superlattice intrinsic stacking fault
   energies in Ni3Al based alloys
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB High-throughput quantum mechanics based simulations have been carried out to establish the change in lattice parameter and superlattice intrinsic stacking fault (SISF) formation energies in Ni3Al-based alloys using the axial Ising model. We had direct access to the variation in SISF energies due to finite compositional change of the added ternary transition metal (TM) element through constructing large supercells, which was equally necessary to account for chemical disorder. We find that most added TM ternaries induce an important quasi-linear increase in the SISF energy as a function of alloying composition x. The most pronounced increase corresponds to Fe addition, while Co addition decreases the SISF energy monotonically. Our results shed light on the role played by TM elements on strengthening L1(2) Ni3Al precipitates against stacking fault shear. The data are of high importance for designing new Ni-based superalloys based on computational approaches. (C) 2017 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Microsegregation and precipitates of an as-cast Co-based
   superalloy-microstructural characterization and phase stability
   modelling
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB The demand for increased efficiency of industrial gas turbines and aero engines drives the search for the next generation of materials. Promising candidates for such new materials are Co-based superalloys. We characterize the microsegregation and solidification of a multi-component Co-based superalloy and compare it to a ternary Co-Al-W compound and to two exemplary Ni-based superalloys by combining the experimental characterization of the as-cast microstructures with complementary modelling of phase stability. On the experimental side, we characterize the microstructure and precipitates by electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and determine the element distributions and microsegregation coefficients by electron probe microanalysis (EPMA). On the modelling side, we carry out solidification simulations and a structure map analysis in order to relate the local chemical composition with phase stability. We find that the microsegregation coefficients for the individual elements are very similar in the investigated Co-based and Ni-based superalloys. By interpreting the local chemical composition from EPMA with the structure map, we effectively unite the set of element distribution maps to compound maps with very good contrast of the dendritic microstructure. The resulting compound maps of the microstructure in terms of average band filling and atomic-size difference explain the formation of topologically close-packed phases in the interdendritic regions. We identify B2, C14, and D0(24) precipitates with chemical compositions that are in line with the structure map.

AB We characterized the microstructural features and mechanical performance of a model Co-5.6Al-5.8W-6.6Ti-0.12B (at.%) alloy consisting of gamma(L1(2))-precipitates in a gamma(f.c.c.)-matrix. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to follow the isothermal aging of the micro-structure at 900 and 1000 degrees C for 256 h, and 950 degrees C for 1000 h. The compositions of the gamma'(L1(2))-precipitates and gamma(f.c.c.)-matrix were evaluated by atom-probe tomography (APT) for solution-treated and air-cooled conditions, as well as in specimens aged at 950 degrees C for 16 and 100 h. Boron was shown to partition preferentially to the gamma'(L1(2))-precipitates, and profiles taken across the gamma(f.c.c.)-matrix channels in both aged specimens revealed confined segregation of A1 at one of the two gamma(f.c.c.)/gamma'(L1(2)) heterophase interfaces. After aging at 950 degrees C for 16 h, Co-5.6Al-5.8W-6.6Ti-0.12B (at.%) exhibited anomalous flow-strength behavior in the range 625-900 degrees C with a peak yield stress of 822 MPa between 800 and 825 degrees C. Compressive creep tests performed at 850 degrees C demonstrated a creep strength comparable to archival literature results for Co-9Al-9W-0.12B (at.%), despite a smaller gamma'(L1(2))-volume fraction and lack of strengthening borides along the grain boundaries (GBs). The activation energy for creep in the temperature range 800-900 degrees C was 606 kJ mol(-1). The post-creep microstructure consists of rafted gamma'(L1(2))-precipitates perpendicular to the compression axis, consistent with the positive gamma(f.c.c.)/gamma'(L1(2)) lattice parameter misfit character of this class of alloys. Creep failure could occur due to GB embrittlement caused by deleterious Ti-rich (L2(1) or B2) and D0(19) phases formed at the GBs during creep. (C) 2019 Acta Materialia Inc.

TI Temperature evolution and life prediction in fatigue of superalloys
SO METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND
   MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Low-cycle fatigue behavior of two superalloys, ULTIMET(R) alloy, Co-26 pct Cr-9 pct Ni (wt pct), and HAYNES(R) HR-120(R) alloy, Ni-33 pct Fe-25 pct Cr, was studied at room temperature. An infrared thermography system was employed to monitor the temperature evolution of fatigue processes for both superalloys. Temperature changes during fatigue were related to the hysteresis effect, and were successfully predicted, based on the consideration of the hysteresis effect and heat conduction. The temperature increase of a specimen from the initial to the equilibrium stages was used as an index to predict the fatigue life of the two superalloys. It was found that the fatigue-life predictions using the present model were in good agreement with the experimental results.

TI The microstructure and hardness of Ni-Co-Al-Ti-Cr quinary alloys
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB The effects of Ni:Co and Al:Ti ratios on the room temperature microstructure, hardness and lattice parameter of twenty-seven quinary Ni-Co-Al-Ti-Cr alloys have been evaluated. All of the alloys exhibited a uniform gamma-gamma' microstructure. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) showed that the liquidus and solidus temperatures of the alloys increased with greater Al: Ti ratios, decreased with Cr concentration and remained largely unchanged with respect to the Ni:Co ratio. Neutron diffraction measurements of the gamma and gamma' lattice parameters revealed that the lattice misfit in all of the alloys was positive and increased with Ti concentration (i.e. lower Al:Ti ratio) regardless of the concentration of Cr, or the ratio of Ni: Co. Importantly, alloys with a Ni:Co ratio of 1:1, were found to have consistently greater lattice misfits than alloys with Ni:Co ratios of either 1:3 or 3:1. The measured lattice misfits were found to be strongly correlated with the Vickers hardness of the alloys, suggesting that lattice misfit plays a key role in the strengthening of gamma-gamma' alloys of this type.

TI Hot deformation behavior and DRX mechanism in a gamma-gamma '
   cobalt-based superalloy
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB gamma-gamma'cobalt-based superalloys have been the main focus of attention as a new class of high temperature materials. The present research studies the hot deformation, microstructure evolution, and dynamic recrystallization (DRX) mechanisms of a cast Co-Al-W superalloy during the hot compression process. The microstructure of the starting material is constituted of large MC carbide particles within a coarse grain structure. Two hot deformation regimes, i.e., low temperature (950 degrees C-1050 degrees C) and high temperature (1100 degrees C-1200 degrees C) were designed and performed. Flow curve and constitutive analysis using a hyperbolic sine equation evidenced two distinct behaviors among the regimes. Microstructural evaluation revealed a large volume fraction of fine gamma'particles with radius less than 100 nm, precipitated during heating and isothermal holding, which precluded DRX in the low temperature regime. In the high temperature regime, new grains were formed through a special discontinuous DRX at three different regions in the microstructure: original grain boundaries, vicinity of MC carbides and the interior of the relatively coarse grains; these may be attributed to the mechanisms of SIBM, PSN and sub-grain growth, respectively. A conceptual descriptive model for the especial DRX phenomenon was proposed.

SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB The influence of high temperature aging treatment on room temperature tensile properties of wrought nickel-base superalloys Alloy 617 and Haynes 230 was investigated. A significant decrease in elongation was observed for Alloy 617 exposed to a heavily oxidizing and decarburizing condition because of coarsening of grain boundary carbides and extensive inter-granular oxidation. On the other hand, Haynes 230 showed much lower ductility when exposed to a heavily carburizing condition, especially at 1000 degrees C because extensive carburization occurred due to a reaction with tungsten. Considerable loss of ductility for Alloy 617 and Haynes 230 was also observed in He-H-2-H2O-CO-CO2-CH4 and He-H2O-CO-CO2 environments, which were the slightly oxidizing and decarburizing conditions. Loss of ductility was predominantly associated with brittle inter-granular cracking, while the extent of loss of ductility decreased depending on the decarburization depth. Decarburization was observed more extensively in helium with H-2-H2O-CO-CO2-CH4 than helium with H2O-CO-CO2, and for Alloy 617 than for Haynes 230. Finally, the role of H-2 in accelerating decarburization is discussed. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved,

AB The abilities of artificial neural networks and Gaussian processes to model the yield strength of nickel-base superalloys as a function of composition and temperature have been compared on the basis of simple well-known metallurgical trends (influence of Ti, Al, Co, Mo, W, Ta, of the Ti/Al ratio, gamma' volume fraction and the testing temperature). The methodologies are found to give similar results, and are able to predict the behaviour of materials that were not shown to the models during their creation. The Gaussian process modelling method is the simpler method to use, but its computational cost becomes larger than that of neural networks for large data sets.

SO COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB The strengthening effects induced by alloying elements (Re, Ru, Cr, Co, Mor, W, Ta) on Ni/Ni3Al interface in single crystal Ni-based superalloys are investigated in terms of Griffith work using first-principles density functional theory. The best strengthening effect on Ni/Ni3Al interface can be attributed to Re, and the elements W and Ta appear to be less potent with Co having little effect. This sequence of creep-strengthening effect of alloying elements obtained from our calculations is consistent with relevant experimental observations. The calculated Griffith works for more elements of transition metals indicate that elements near the centre of the d block of the periodic table are more favorable for improving the rupture strength than those from the far west and far east of the transition metal block.

TI Codeposition of Co and Al on nickel base superalloys by pack cementation
   process
SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB To seek favorable conditions for the codeposition of Co and Al to form diffusion coatings on nickel base superalloys, the thermochemical analyses were adopted for a series of pack powder mixtures containing Co, Al, halide salts and Al2O3. The halide salts studied were AlF3 and NH4Cl. On the basis of the thermochemical calculations, the pack powder mixture of 7.6A1-20Co-4NR(4)Cl-68.4Al(2)O(3) (wt.%) activated by NH4Cl was formulated. The coatings had a two-layer structure, of which the outer layer was mainly composed of Al0.9Ni1.1 where a part of Ni was replaced by Co. Once this was achieved, a series of further experiments was undertaken to investigate the effects of deposition duration and temperature on the kinetics of coating growth process. It was observed that these parameters only affected the coating thickness. The parabolic relationship between the coating thickness and the deposition duration confirms that the process was mainly diffusion-controlled. The experimental results of the oxidation showed that the coating can prevent efficiently substrate from oxidizing. The excellent oxidation resistance was attributed to a continuous and compact alpha-Al2O3 film formed on the surface of sample. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SO ANNALES DE CHIMIE-SCIENCE DES MATERIAUX
AB High temperature oxidation of cast cobalt-based alloys reinforced by different MC carbides (M = Ta, Nb, Hf or Zr) The aim of this work is to study if NbC, HfC and ZrC carbides can be obtained in a cobalt-based alloy, and what can be the high temperature behaviours of alloys containing such MC carbides in both stability and oxidation. Several alloys, all based on Co-8Ni-30Cr-0,2 or 0,4C (weight contents), and containing quantities of Nb, Hf or Zr which allow obtaining the same carbides densities, were synthesized by high frequency induction melting, and compared to a similar TaC-containing alloy. The as-cast alloys display NbC, HfC or ZrC carbides forming an interdendritic eutectic with matrix. After several tens hours at 1200 degrees C, all carbides are affected by a decrease in volume fraction and by a fragmentation phenomenon. This effect does not influence significantly the room temperature hardness of the alloys. Oxidation of the (Nb, Hf or Zr)C-containing alloys at 1200 degrees C is much faster than for a TaC-containing alloy. After thermogravimetry runs, external oxides formed on the (Nb, Hf or Zr)C-containing samples are mainly spinels while a TaC-containing alloy is still covered by chromia.

AB The formation of topologically close-packed (TCP) phases in nickel-base superalloys is an issue of increasing importance as alloys are designed with higher refractory element contents to meet the requirements of next generation turbine engines. This review considers the factors that affect an alloy's susceptibility to TCP formation. In particular, the debate surrounding the effect of certain individual elements, such as Co and Re, in promoting or suppressing TCP formation is examined alongside the various mechanisms that have been proposed to account for this behaviour. In addition, the detrimental effects of these phases on the alloy's mechanical properties are discussed, including crack initiation at precipitates, depletion of solid solution strengthening refractory elements and the effect on Y/Y' rafting behaviour.

SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB Microstructural features, including gamma channel width, gamma' size, gamma' volume fraction, gamma-gamma' lattice misfit, TCP phase as well as dislocation substructures had influence on the creep performance in Ni-base single crystal superalloys. However, relatively limited work has been conducted to investigate the effect of microstructural features based on various alloying additions on creep properties in Ru-containing single crystal superalloys. In this study, the creep tests were conducted at 950 degrees C and 400 MPa in experimental alloys with different levels Co (7.0 wt% and 15.0 wt%), Cr (3.5 wt% and 6.0 wt%), Mo (1.0 wt% and 2.5 wt%) and Ru (2.5 wt% and 4.0 wt%) additions, and the microstructures during creep were characterized in detail. Co and Ru were found to decrease the gamma channel width, respectively. The high level of Cr addition decreased the gamma' volume fraction and promote the TCP phase formation during creep. The addition of Mo decreased the gamma channel width and also acted as a TCP former. The gamma-gamma' lattice misfit was increased to more negative by the individual additions of Co, Ru, Cr, and Mo, respectively. The joint addition of microstructural stabilizers Co and Ru inhibited the TCP phase formation during creep. The precipitation of TCP phases served as one of the main factor to decrease the creep property in alloys with high level of Cr and Mo additions, respectively. The synergistic effect of Mo and Ru additions in the alloy with high level of Co content was found to increase the gamma-gamma' lattice misfit and the amount of stacking faults in gamma matrix during creep process, which improved the creep resistance at 950 degrees C and 400 MPa. This study is helpful to understand the effect of alloying elements additions and microstructures on creep performance and to get better improvement of physical metallurgy knowledge and alloy design in Ru-containing single crystal superalloys.

Results reveal that the calculated oxide layer sequence (Thermo-Calc, TCNI6) is in good agreement with the formed oxide scales on the alloy surface.

TI EFFECT OF NOTCH ORIENTATION AND LOCAL RECRYSTALLIZATION ON THERMAL
   FATIGUE PROPERTIES OF A DIRECTIONALLY SOLIDIFIED Co-BASED SUPERALLOY
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB The directionally solidificated (DS) Co-based superalloys are widely used in aircraft turbine vanes due to the good stress-rupture parameters and excellent hot corrosion resistance. The cyclic change of temperatures and complex stress state thermal fatigue (TF) cracks happen frequently in vanes during service. However, most of the work are conducted in Ni-based superalloys and there is rare report concerning the TF behavior of DS Co-based superalloys. Furthermore, due to the residual strain accumulated during processing, shot peening, grinding and recrystallization (RX) frequently occur when the DS components are exposed to high temperatures. It is believed that RX may change the microstructure, especially adding more grain boundaries to DS alloys, and result in the reduction of the mechanical properties of DS superalloys. Therefore, in this work, V-notch plate specimens with notch direction perpendicular and parallel to the DS orientation are machined from the DS plate. Local RX grains are prepared (local indented and then heat treated) in the notch areas of some samples. TF test is conducted between 1000 degrees C to room temperature. The effect of DS orientation and RX on TF properties of a DS Co-based superalloy is investigated. The results indicate that the cracks propagate along the interdendritic regions in the samples with notches parallel to the DS direction, which exhibites lower TF properties than samples with notches vertical to the DS direction. TF cracks initiate and propagate along RX boundaries in samples containing RX grains. Precipitation of M23C6 carbides is found along the RX boundaries during TF tests. Due to the oxidation at the tip of crack, M23C6 desquamates and leads to the formation of micro voids, which accelerates the crack propagation and decreases TF properties of tested alloy. In samples with notches parallel to the DS direction, cracks preferentially propagate along the RX grain boundaries.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MATERIALS RESEARCH
AB The role of vaporisation in the evolution of surface microstructural instability has been investigated in Ni-base superalloys during heat treatment below the solvus temperature. Initial nucleation of beta (beta) grains at the surface with random orientations arose from vaporisation of Ni, Co and Cr with subsequent de-stabilisation of gamma (gamma) phase. Further vaporisation and inter-diffusion resulted in a discontinuous reaction (secondary reaction zone -gamma prime (gamma') matrix + topologically close packed phases with needle-like morphology). On the other hand, advancement of the secondary reaction zone grain boundary was shown to be dependent only on the solute supersaturation ahead of the boundary. The driving force for growth of the secondary reaction zone was calculated from the Gibbs energy change and nearly all of this force was available to pull the grain boundary.

AB High-temperature constructional parts of aircraft engines and energy units are exposed to high dynamic stress (fatigue processes and creep) and various temperatures in dioxide-corrosion condition (hot corrosion, oxidation and erosion). The improvement of aero-engine and turbine efficiency is possible through the increase of temperature in front of turbine. This requires the use of heat-resistant and creep-resistant materials, especially nickel-base superalloys which resist mentioned effects for a limited period of time. A deposition of protective layers should improve hot corrosion resistance. This paper is focused on microstructure of protective layers created by co-deposition of Al and Si on nickel-base superalloys INCO 713 LC and INCO 738 LC after thermal and thermal-stress exposition and on microstructure of basic materials (substrates). The contribution also shows creep tests results for both superalloys with and without a protective layer.

TI Segregation at stacking faults within the gamma ' phase of two Ni-base
   superalloys following intermediate temperature creep
SO SCRIPTA MATERIALIA
AB Using state-of-the-art energy dispersive spectroscopy, it has been established for the first time that there exists significant compositional variation (enrichment of Co and Cr and deficiency of Ni and Al) associated with superlattice intrinsic stacking faults created in the ordered gamma' precipitates following intermediate temperature deformation of two commercial superalloys. The results indicate that long range diffusion of these elements is intimately involved in the precipitate shearing process and is therefore closely linked to the time-dependent deformation of the alloys.

TI The Co-Ti system revisited: About the cubic-to-hexagonal Laves phase
   transformation and other controversial features of the phase diagram
SO CALPHAD-COMPUTER COUPLING OF PHASE DIAGRAMS AND THERMOCHEMISTRY
AB The Co-Ti system is one of the important systems for the development of Co-based superalloys and it is the only binary Co-X system where the characteristic, fine-scaled gamma/gamma' microstructures (fcc-Co with fcc L1(2)-ordered TiCo3) can form. Surprisingly, the phase relations and invariant reaction temperatures in the Co-rich part of the system are not very well established and there are fundamental inconsistencies between different versions of the phase diagram. Crucial points such as the type of formation reaction of the gamma' phase TiCo3 from the melt are unclear. The system is not only of high scientific interest because of the presence of the gamma/gamma' microstructure, but also due to the occurrence of two different, stable polytypes of the Laves phase TiCo2 (hexagonal C36 and cubic C15 type). The phase fields of these two polytypes should be separated by a two-phase field the existence of which however has never been clearly proven. A re-investigation of the Co-rich part of the phase diagram (0-50 at.% Ti) including all invariant reactions as well as the liquidus, solidus, and solvus lines was performed by not only making use of equilibrated alloys but also applying diffusion couples.

TI First-principles investigation of electronic, mechanical and
   thermodynamic properties of L1(2) ordered Co-3(M, W) (M = Al, Ge, Ga)
   phases
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB Studies were carried out on the equilibrium structural, temperature-dependent mechanical and thermodynamic properties of the Co-3(M, W) (M = Al, Ge, Ga) phases in terms of first-principles calculations. The results of the ground-state elastic constants revealed that Co-3(M, W) phases are mechanically stable and possess intrinsic ductility. It was found that the elastic heat-resistant properties of Co-3(Ge, W) phase are inferior to those of Co-3(Al, W) and Co-3(Ga, W). Analyzing the charge density difference provides the explanation that the sharp decrease in mechanical properties is mainly due to the weakening of Co-Ge bonding at elevated temperatures for Co-3(Ge, W). The elastic anisotropy as a function of temperature is discussed using a universal index. It is observed that Co-3(M, W) phases show a high degree of elastic anisotropy. The degree of elastic anisotropy could be significantly decreased by an increase in temperature for Co-3(M, W). The lattice vibration is treated with the quasiharmonic phonon approach, considering both the vibrational and thermal electronic contributions. The thermodynamic properties as a function of temperature are computed without any adjustable parameters, including heat capacity, entropy, enthalpy and thermal expansion coefficient.

TI Analysis of element-content effects on equilibrium segregation at

   variation method
SO INTERMETALLICS
AB Effects of alloying element-content on equilibrium segregation at and adjacent to the (100) gamma/gamma' interface in Ni-base superalloys were analyzed by using the cluster variation method incorporated with tetrahedron approximation and the phenomenological Lennard-Jones potential. Results suggest that Al-site occupiers in the gamma' phase such as Mo, Re and W were enriched near the interface on the side of the gamma phase. On the other hand, Co, which prefers to substitute for Ni site, exhibited minimal segregation in the gamma phase. The enrichment of the refractory elements such as Mo, Re and W around the interface was moderated, because Co addition slightly diluted refractory elements throughout the gamma phase.

AB Nine cast alloys reinforced by very high fractions of carbides, Ni-30Cr-xC, Co-30Cr-xC and Fe-30Cr-xC with x varying from 1.2 to 2.0, were tested in oxidation at high temperature between 1,000 and 1,200 degrees C in air for 50 hours. After oxidation, their surfaces and sub-surfaces were characterized. Even for very high carbon contents, the chromia-forming behaviour of the nickel alloys is kept. The oxidation modes of the cobalt alloys and iron alloys are not changed compared to low carbon alloys of these families. The differences of diffusion easiness of chromium in matrix, between nickel alloys, cobalt alloys and iron alloys are the same as for alloys with lower carbon content.,;, as suggested by the lower chromium gradients in the nickel alloys compared to the two other alloy types. Sub-surface microstructure transformations due to oxidation were observed in some cases (coarsening of carbides due to an inwards diffusion of carbon, change of the sharing between BCC-FCC of iron matrix due to outwards diffusion of chromium). Catastrophic never occurred for these alloys during the 50 hours of exposition to air at high temperature.

TI A New Polycrystalline Co-Ni Superalloy
SO JOM
AB In 2006, a new-ordered L1(2) phase, Co-3(Al,W), was discovered that can form coherently in a face-centered cubic (fcc) A1 Co matrix. Since then, a community has developed that is attempting to take these alloys forward into practical applications in gas turbines. A new candidate polycrystalline Co-Ni gamma/gamma' superalloy, V208C, is presented that has the nominal composition 36Co-35Ni-15Cr-10Al-3W-1Ta (at.%). The alloy was produced by conventional powder metallurgy superalloy methods. After forging, a gamma' fraction of similar to 56% and a secondary gamma' size of 88 nm were obtained, with a grain size of 2.5 mu m. The solvus temperature was 1000 degrees C. The density was found to be 8.52 g cm(-3), which is similar to existing Ni alloys with this level of gamma'. The alloy showed the flow stress anomaly and a yield strength of 920 MPa at room temperature and 820 MPa at 800 degrees C, similar to that of Mar-M247. These values are significantly higher than those found for either conventional solution and carbide-strengthened Co alloys or the gamma/gamma' Co superalloys presented in the literature thus far. The oxidation resistance, with a mass gain of 0.08 mg cm(-2) in 100 h at 800 degrees C, is also comparable with that of existing high-temperature Ni superalloys. These results suggest that Co-based and Co-Ni superalloys may hold some promise for the future in gas turbine applications.

TI Freckle Formation in Ni-base Superalloys
SO TETSU TO HAGANE-JOURNAL OF THE IRON AND STEEL INSTITUTE OF JAPAN
AB In order to reduce CO(2) emissions from fusel power plants, advanced ultra super critical (A-USC) steam turbine has been developing in Europe, the United States, and Japan. Candidate materials for A-USC steam turbine are Ni-base superalloys because 700 degrees C exceeds the maximum service temperature of heat-resistant ferrite steels. Ni-base superalloys have Superior high temperature properties, but they are well known as freckle prone material. One of the keys to the Success of A-USC development is the availability of large size ingots for turbine shaft materials. There have been few Studies on the productivity of Ni-base superalloys for large ingots. In this study, six A-USC candidate alloys were selected. Freckle tendencies of those A-USC candidate alloys were assessed using a horizontal directional solidification apparatus. The tested alloys tended to freckle in the following order: Alloy230>LTES700>Alloy625>Alloy706>Alloy617-Ti free>FENIX-700>USC141>Alloy617-Ti. We propose that the tendencies could be estimated from liquid density difference calculations.

SO CORROSION SCIENCE
AB The microstructure and corrosion behavior was studied for a Co modified NiAl coating formed on the superalloy DZ125 by pack cementation process. The hot corrosion kinetics showed that the mass gain of the coated specimen was three orders of magnitude lower than that of the uncoated specimen at 1173 K up to 100 h. The corrosion product formed on the surface of the coating mainly consisted of a protective alpha-Al2O3 film. The presence of Co in the coating could promote the establishment of a protective Al2O3 scale on the coating and restrain the internal diffusion of sulphur in the coating. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

TI On the compatibility of single crystal superalloys with a thermal
   barrier coating system
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB The compatibility of three Co-containing prototype single crystal nickel-based superalloys with a thermal barrier coating (TBC) system is examined. These contain 2.1, 8.4 and 12.6 at.% Co; the concentrations of At, Cr, Ta, W, Re, Hf are identical and chosen to be representative of advanced grades of these alloys. The TBC consists of an yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) layer formed by electron beam physical vapour deposition (EB-PVD) and a bond coat made by electrodeposited platinum with a subsequent interdiffusion heat treatment - a so-called 'platinum-diffused' bond coat. The resistance to spallation of the TBC system is degraded as the Co content of the substrate increases. Wavelength-dispersive X-ray analysis and secondary ion mass spectrometry indicate that quantities of Co are present in the thermally grown oxide (TGO) by the time that failure occurs, this effect being most pronounced when the Co content of the substrate is high; the TGO is then more wavy and convoluted. The bond coat consists exclusively of the gamma and gamma' phases, with the balance shifting towards gamma with increasing thermal exposure; the loss of At from the bond coat due to TGO formation means that the TGO is eventually in contact with the gamma phase solely, which is enriched in Co.

The misfit in the two alloys was found to be +0.67 and +0.59%, using neutron diffraction at HRPD. The misfit was found to increase with temperature, as in Ni superalloys. This implies that the amount of coherency strengthening increases with temperature.

SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING AND PERFORMANCE
AB Alumina ceramics were brazed to Inconel 600 and UMCo-50 superalloys at 900 C for 10 min using an Sn10Ag4Ti active filler metal. The brazing filler showed good wettability on alumina and super-alloys. The flexural strengths were 69 and 57 MPa for alumina/Inconel 600 and alumina/UMCo-50 joints, respectively. In both cases, the brazed specimens fractured along the Sn10Ag4Ti/superalloy interfaces after four-point bending tests. Electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) elemental mapping revealed that the Ni of Inconel 600 and the Co of UMCo-50 dissolved into Sn10Ag4Ti filler metal, which serves to reinforce the weak Sn10Ag4Ti matrix.

SO SURFACE ENGINEERING
AB Cr3C2-25NiCr coatings are essential to provide protection against both wear and corrosion of superalloys particularly in the temperature range up to 900-1000 degrees C. The Cr3C2-25NiCr coatings were deposited on the Fe and Ni based superalloys by D gun spray technique and subsequently investigated for their microstructural characteristics such as coating thickness, porosity, phase formation, microhardness, surface and cross-sectional morphologies. The coatings showed a dense microstructure with porosity contents less than 0(.)69%. The carbide grains of different size are uniformly cladded with the metallic binder and located around the splat boundaries as observed in the coatings. Lower carbide dissolution and its uniform distribution ensured a better binder protection in the coatings. High cohesive strength of the individual splats and high volume fraction of carbides contributed for the higher microhardness values of the coatings (775-1200 HV).

TI Role of Superficially Applied SnO2 Inhibitor in Controlling High
   Temperature Corrosion of Some Fe-, Co- and Ni-Base Superalloys
SO OXIDATION OF METALS
AB Inhibitors and fuel additives have been used with varying success to combat high temperature corrosion of metals and alloys. In this work, the role of a superficially applied SnO2 coating to combat high temperature corrosion of some superalloys viz Superfer 800H (Alloy A), Superco 605 (Alloy B) and Superni 75 (Alloy C) has been investigated. Accelerated corrosion testing of the coated as well as bare superalloys was done in a molten salt environment (Na2SO4-60 %V2O5-) at 900 A degrees C for 50 cycles. Each cycle consisted of 1 h heating in a silicon carbide tube furnace followed by 20 min cooling in ambient air. Weight change measurements after each cycle were taken by an electronic balance having an accuracy of 0.01 mg. XRD, SEM and EPMA analyses of the exposed specimens were carried out to characterize the oxide scales. The bare superalloys showed more overall weight gains, in general, in comparison with their SnO2 coated counterparts. The corrosion rate for the bare Co-base alloy was found to be highest, whereas that for the Fe-base Superfer 800H a lowest. The percentage decrease in the weight gain in alloys A, B and C with superficially applied SnO2 was found to be 17.2, 66 and 50 % respectively after 30 cycles. The effectiveness of the SnO2 was perhaps due to its non-reactive nature with the corroding species and high melting point (1630 A degrees C).

Differently oriented crystals with [001] and [011] orientations were fabricated with seeding technique. The results showed that primary dendrite arm spacings decreased simultaneously with the increase of misroientation. The primary dendrites arrange in lines in [011] single crystal. For [001] oriented crystals, the size of ?' phase increased with the increasing of misorientation. However, it was observed that the size of ?' decreased with large misorientation for [011] orientated growth. Meanwhile, more ?' in [011] crystals tended to be triangular.

AB Five cast cobalt alloys based on Co-M-30Cr-0.4/0.45C and containing Ta, Nb, Hf and/or Zr were studied by metallography in the as-cast condition and after treatments at 1300 degrees C. The obtained MC carbides were all interdendritic with a eutectic script-like morphology. For similar carbon contents, the HfC carbides are the most developed in the as-cast microstructure and the most stable at 1300 degrees C. As-cast, the TaC carbides are less developed than the former and they tend to become more firactioned and less present in microstructure at 1300 degrees C. The NbC carbides, which have initially the same morphology and the same fraction as TaC rapidly dissolve at 1300 degrees C. The cobalt alloys containing HfC or TaC are chromia - forming at 1300 degrees C. The NbC-containing alloy catastrophically oxides after only few hours at 1300 degrees C. The average hardness is the highest for the WC-containing alloy and the lowest for the W-containing alloy. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Microstructural features, including gamma' volume fraction and size, gamma-gamma' lattice misfit, gamma channel width, and dislocation substructure, are known to significantly influence the creep performance in Ni-base single-crystal superalloys. In this study, the microstructural characteristics of Ru-containing single-crystal superalloys with different levels of Co, Mo, and Ru additions were quantitatively investigated after ruptured and interrupted creep tests conducted at 1223 K (950 degrees C) and 400 MPa. The creep lifetime was slightly increased with the high level of Co addition and significantly increased with the coadditions of Mo and Ru. A minor effect of Co content on the gamma channel width and gamma' volume fraction was found in experimental alloys. The alloy with high levels of Mo and Ru additions was determined to possess a more negative gamma-gamma' lattice misfit, and a high density of stacking faults (SFs) was formed in the gamma channels during creep. The combined effects of the SFs in the gamma matrix serving as the barriers to dislocation movement, as well as the dense interfacial dislocation networks preventing dislocation to shear the gamma' phase, were considered as the main mechanism responsible for the improvement of creep resistance. Results from this study are helpful to understand the effect of microstructural features on creep performance and contribute to the knowledge of physical metallurgy in Ru-containing single-crystal superalloys.

TI Phase Formation and Oxidation Behavior at 500 degrees C in a Ni-Co-Al
   Thin-Film Materials Library
SO ACS COMBINATORIAL SCIENCE
AB The complete ternary system Ni-Co-Al was fabricated as a thin film materials library by combinatorial magnetron sputtering and was annealed subsequently in several steps in Ar and under atmospheric conditions at 500 degrees C. Ni-Co-Al is the base system for both Ni- and Co-based superalloys. Therefore, the phases occurring in this system and their oxidation behavior is of high interest. The Ni-Co-Al materials library was investigated using high-throughput characterization methods such as optical measurements, resistance screening, automated EDX, automated XRD, and XPS. From the obtained data a thin film phase diagram for the Ni-Co-Al system in its state after annealing at 500 degrees C in air was established. Furthermore, a surface oxide composition map of the full Ni-Co-Al system for oxidation at 500 degrees C was concluded. As a result, it could be shown that at 500 degrees C an amount of 10 at. % Al is necessary for a Ni-Co-Al thin film to produce a protective Al-oxide scale.

TI Features and effect factors of creep of single-crystal nickel-base
   superalloys
SO METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND
   MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB The creep behavior of two single-crystal nickel-base superalloys with [001] orientation has been studied by measuring the creep curves, internal friction stress of dislocation motion, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observation and energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX) composition analysis. The results show that over the stress and temperature range, there are different creep activation energies, time exponents, and effective stress exponents in two alloys at different creep stages. The size and volume fraction of the gamma' phase in the tantalum-free alloy is obviously decreased with the elevated temperature, This results in the decrease of the internal friction stress during steady-state creep. Higher levels of tungsten in the alloy result in a smaller strain value and lower directional-coarsening rate during primary creep. During steady-state creep, the primary reason for the better creep resistance of the other alloy is that it contains more Al and also Ta, which maintains a high volume fraction of gamma' phase. The dislocation climb over the gamma' rafts is the major deformation mechanisms during steady-state tensile creep. The fact that the strain rate is decreased with the increase of the size and volume fraction of the gamma' rafts may be described by a modified constitutive equation that is based on a model of the rate of dislocation motion.

TI Effect of stacking fault segregation and local phase transformations on
   creep strength in Ni-base superalloys
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB In this study, two similar, commercial polycrystalline Ni-based disk superalloys (LSHR and ME3) were creep tested at 760 degrees C and 552 MPa to approximately 0.3% plastic strain. LSHR consistently displayed superior creep properties at this stress/temperature regime even though the microstructural characteristics between the two alloys were comparable. High resolution structural and chemical analysis, however, revealed significant differences between the two alloys among active gamma' shearing modes involving superlattice intrinsic and extrinsic stacking faults. In ME3, Co and Cr segregation and Ni and Al depletion were observed along the intrinsic faults-revealing a gamma' to gamma phase transformation. Conversely in LSHR, an alloy with a higher W content, Co and W segregation was observed along the intrinsic faults. This observation combined with scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) simulations confirm a gamma'-to-D0(19) chi phase transformation along the intrinsic faults in LSHR. Using experimental observations and density functional theory calculations, a novel local phase transformation strengthening mechanism is proposed that could be further utilized to improve the high temperature creep capabilities of Ni-base disk alloys.

TI Co-growing mechanism of gamma/gamma ' eutectic on MC-type carbide in
   Ni-based single crystal superalloys
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB To clarify and comprehend the co-growing mechanism of gamma/gamma' eutectic on MC-type carbide in a single crystal CM247LC superalloy, the interface and the elements' segregation between MC-type carbide and gamma/gamma' eutectic was investigated in this paper. The results show that a semi-coherent boundary was observed having an orientation relationship of {(11) over bar1}(MC) parallel to {(11) over bar1}(gamma/gamma') with < 011>(MC) parallel to < 011>(gamma/gamma'). This interface structure resulted in a high interface energy, and a reduced preference of gamma/gamma' eutectic's nucleation on MC-type carbide. However, this unfavorable interfacial feature was offset by the elements' segregation profile during the MC-type carbide's solidification, which is characterized by Al, Ni, Co and Cr enrichment and a co-growing mode.

AB A polycrystalline hot working ingot metallurgy processing route for gamma/gamma' Co-Al-W superalloys has been developed. Based on Co-7Al-7W (at%), substitutions of Mo, V, Ti, Ta, Ni, Si, Fe and Cr were examined. The gamma' solvus was found to follow the same trends as those exhibited by alloys with higher gamma' fractions considered by other investigators. Excessive Cr additions were found to lead to discontinuous coarsening and eventually, the loss of the gamma' phase from the microstructures observed. Ni additions were examined, with some success, and found to restore the gamma' phase and raise the solvus temperature. It was found that the addition of 13 at.% Cr improved the oxidation resistance at 800 degrees C by over 40 times. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The high-temperature oxidation behaviours of Ni base and Co base cast superalloys were studied to determine the effect of different grain sizes and different surface dendritic orientations. These microstructural characteristics were obtained by varying solidification rate and cutting orientation with regard to the external surface. Thermogravimetry tests were run at 1000 and 1100degreesC and parabolic oxidation constants were considered. It appears that oxidation is faster for fine microstructures than for coarser ones for Ni or Co alloys including tungsten in their chemical composition, while it is the contrary when W is not present. When the sample surface is mainly parallel to the dendritic network, the oxidation rate is greater than for a surface perpendicular to dendrites, for the studied Ni alloy. The same phenomenon is observed for the studied Co base alloy at 1100degreesC but the order is inverted at 1000degreesC. These different behaviours can be explained by the grain boundary densities and orientations obtained on surface, since they can influence the diffusion of species involved in the oxidation phenomena. It is also possible that the characteristics of the chromia scale, such as grain size and general quality, depend on the microstructural texture of the alloy.

Different, phenomena occurred in the sub-surface microstructure, depending on both alloy and temperature. Thermodynamic modelling was used to know what it happened for carbon during oxidation, then to explain the observed microstructural changes. It appears that carbon atoms either quit the alloy probably after its oxidation into gases, or on the contrary go deeper into the bulk where they promote the precipitation of new carbides by solid state transformation. Thereafter, thermodynamic modelling allowed to know the new local refractoriness of the zones affected by oxidation, then to appreciate the new mechanical properties in the sub-surface.

TI Cluster formulas of Co-Al-W-base superalloys
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Having a gamma/gamma' microstructure similar to Ni-base superalloys and also including various alloying elements such as Al and W, new Co-base superalloy, namely Co-Al-W-base alloy, has been widely studied as a kind of potential alternative of Ni-base superalloy, which is the most important high-temperature structural material in industrial applications. Besides, Co-Al-W-base alloy has also excellent mechanical properties, for example, creep properties comparable to those of the first-generation Ni-base single crystal superalloys. In our previous work, the ideal composition formula of Ni-base superalloy has been obtained by applying the cluster-plus-glue-atom structure model of faced centered cubic solid solution, which shows that the most stable chemical short-range-order unit is composed of a nearest-neighbor cluster and three next-neighbor glue atoms. In this paper, the ideal cluster formula of Co-Al-W-base superalloy is addressed by using the same approach. Based on cluster-plusglue-atom model theory, according to lattice constants and atom radii, calculations are carried out. The results show that the atom radius of Al is equal to Covalent radius (0.126 nm) and for gamma' phase the atom radius of W changes obviously (0.1316 nm). After analyzing atomic radii, the chemical formula for Co-Al-W ternary alloy is calculated to be [Al-Co-12](Co,Al,W)(3), which signifies an Al centered atom and twelve Co nearest-neighbored cluster atoms plus three glue atoms, which is in good consistence with that for Ni-base single crystal superalloy. For multi-element alloy, the alloying elements are classified, according to the heat of mixing between the alloying elements and Co as well as partition behavior of alloying elements, as solvent elements-Co-like elements (Co) over bar (Co, Ni, Ir, Ru, Cr, Fe, and Re) and solute elements-Al-like elements (Al) over bar (Al, W, Mo, Ta, Ti, Nb, V, etc.). The solvent elements can be divided into two kinds according to partition behaves: (Co) over bar (gamma) (Cr, Fe, and Re) and (Co) over bar (gamma)' (Ni, Ir, and Ru).
   The latter is further grouped into Al, (W) over bar (W and Mo, which have weaker heat of mixing than Al-Co ) and (Ta) over bar (Ta, Ti, Nb, V, etc., which have stronger heat of mixing than Al-Co). Then all chemically complex Co-Al-W-base superalloys are simplified into (Co) over bar-(Al) over bar pseudo-binary or (Co) over bar -Al-(W) over bar, (Ta) over bar pseudo-ternary system. Within the framework of the cluster-plus-glue-atom formulism and by analyzing the compositions of alloy, it is shown that the Co-Al-W-base superalloy satisfies the ideal formula [(Al) over bar-(Co) over bar (12)] ((Co) over bar (1.0)(Al) over bar (2.0)) (or [(Al) over bar-(Co) over bar Al-1.0(0.5)((W) over bar,(Ta) over bar)(1.5) = (Co) over bar (81.250)(Al) over bar9.375 ((W) over bar, (Ta) over bar)(9.375) at.%). In the same way, those of gamma and gamma' phases are respectively [(Al) over bar-(Co) over bar (12)] ((Co) over bar (1.5)(Al) over bar (1.5)) (or [Al-(Co) over bar (12)] (Co) over bar Al-0.5(2.5)((W) over bar, (Ta) over bar)(1.0 )= (Co) over bar Al-84.375(9.375)((W) over bar, (Ta) over bar)(6.250) at.%) and (Al) over bar-(Co) over bar (12)((Co) over bar (0.5 )(Al) over bar (2.5) ) (or [Al-(Co) over bar (12)]Co (Co) over bar (0.5) Al-0.5 ((W) over bar, (Ta) over bar)(2.0) = (Co) over bar Al-78.125(9.375) ((W) over bar, (Ta) over bar)(12.500) at.%). For example, alloy Co82Al9W9 and its gamma and gamma' phases are formulated respectively as [Al-Co-12] Co1.1Al0.4W1.4 (similar to[Al-Co-12]Co1.5Al0.5W1.0), [Al-Co-12]Co1.6Al0.4W1.0) (similar to[Al-Co-12]Co1.5Al0.5W1.0), and [Al-Co-12]Co0.3Al0.5W2.2) (similar to[Al-Co-12]Co0.5Al0.5W2.0).

TI Probing the crystallography of ordered Phases by coupling of orientation
   microscopy with atom probe tomography
SO ULTRAMICROSCOPY
AB The determination of atomic scale structural and compositional information using atom probe tomography is currently limited to elemental solids and dilute alloys. In the present article, a unique coupling of orientation microscopy and atom probe tomography successfully facilitates the crystallographic study of non-dilute alloy systems, with high evaporation fields. This reproducible methodology affords a new perspective to the conventional atom probe tomography of ordered precipitate strengthened superalloys. The high accuracy in crystallographic site-specific sample preparation results in high spatial resolution in APT, which has been demonstrated in Co-base superalloys. The practical applications of this technique can be extended to accurately characterize the nature of buried order/disorder interfaces at the atomic scale, as well as the site occupancies associated with different solute atoms in multi-component superalloys.

TI Density functional theory study of the thermodynamic and elastic
   properties of Ni-based superalloys
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER
AB The thermophysical properties of Ni-based single-crystal superalloys were investigated using first-principles calculations combined with the quasiharmonic approximation. The effect of alloying elements X (X = Re, Ru, Ta, W, Mo, Cr, and Co) on the thermophysical properties of the gamma-Ni and gamma'-Ni3Al phases was investigated. The calculations showed that alloying can effectively adjust the lattice misfit between the two phases, and Cr can suppress lattice misfit and may improve the creep resistance of alloys. At 0 K, doping with refractory elements leads to tetragonal shear softening of the gamma-Ni phase. For gamma-Ni, Re, Ru, Cr, and Co slightly increase C-44, while Mo, W, and Ta decrease c44. Importantly, high-temperature relative hardening was found to occur close to the service temperature of the superalloy, at which Ru and Cr increase c' and Mo and W increase c44 of gamma-Ni. For the gamma'-Ni3Al phase, all of the alloying elements except Co considerably increase c' and c44. Re and W at the Al site were found to most effectively harden the gamma'-Ni3Al phase. The thermophysical and elastic properties were fully understood by analysis of the electronic structures and phonon spectra. It was found that the electronic density of states (DOS) can account for elastic hardening due to alloying. The phonon spectra along with electronic DOS analysis showed that alloying not only strengthens the first nearest neighbor Ni-X bond through additional d-d hybridization, but it is also important for stiffening the second nearest neighbor Al-X bonding through p-band filling.

TI High Temperature Corrosion Behavior of Superficially Applied CeO2 on
   Some Fe-, Co- and Ni-Based Superalloys
SO SURFACE ENGINEERING AND APPLIED ELECTROCHEMISTRY
AB High temperature corrosion of metals and alloys can be controlled by the use of inhibitors. In this work, the role of a superficially applied CeO2 coating to combat high temperature corrosion of some superalloys such as Superfer 800H (Alloy A), Superco 605 (Alloy B) and Superni 75 (Alloy C) has been investigated. An accelerated corrosion testing of the coated as well as bare superalloys was done in a molten salt environment (Na2SO4-60% V2O5) at 900 degrees C for 50 cycles. The weight change, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Electron Probe Micro Analysis (EPMA) of the exposed specimens were carried out to characterize the oxide scales. The percentage decrease in the weight gain in alloys A, B and C, with superficially applied CeO2, was found to be 23, 35 and 68%, respectively. It was concluded that ceria (ceric oxide) was most effective in reducing the corrosion rate in alloy C.

TI Wetting and interactions of Ni- and Co-based superalloys with different
   ceramic materials
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB In this work, a systematic study of the wetting behavior of two Ni-based and one Co-based superalloys, used, in particular, for the fabrication of turbine blades, is presented with reference to different ceramic substrates: sapphire, polycrystalline alumina, zirconia, and mullite. Wettability tests have been performed by means of the "sessile drop" method at 1500 A degrees C; the characterization of the interfaces between the molten drop and the substrates has been performed by SEM/EDS analysis in order to check the final characteristics of the solidified interfaces. The results are discussed in terms of chemical interactions in relation to the processing parameters and as a function of the surface and interfacial, morphological and energetic properties of the systems.

TI Microstructure formation in gamma-gamma ' Co-Al-W-Ti alloys during
   directional solidification
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB The microstructure formation process in Co-Al-W-Ti alloys was investigated through quenching performed during directional solidification. The phase transition route of the Co-Al-W-Ti alloys during directional solidification is determined as follows: L -> L + gamma -> L + gamma + (beta + gamma') -> L + gamma + gamma' + (beta + gamma') -> gamma + gamma' + beta + (beta + gamma'). The eutectic (beta + gamma'), primary gamma' and b are orderly deposited in terminal stages of solidification. The eutectic gamma' and beta are well distributed and nucleate in random directions. The gamma' particles are precipitated initially from the interdendritic Al-rich regions and subsequently from the dendritic region. The sizes of the gamma' particles close to the primary gamma' and beta phases are greater than that of the particles far from them. Since the growth of eutectic colonies restricts the interdendritic liquid convection at earlier stage of the terminal solidification, Co-Al-W-Ti alloys are resistant to the grain defect formation and suitable for fabricating single crystal components.

TI On the design and feasibility of tantalum-base superalloys
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB In order to reduce the environmental impact of air travel, it is desirable that the efficiencies of gas turbine engines are increased. One way to achieve this goal is to increase the operating temperatures of the engine cores. Unfortunately for aero-engine manufacturers, the temperature capability limits of the Ni-base superalloys used currently have been reached. Hence, new alloys need to be developed that are capable of operating at significantly higher temperatures. In this article, the potential of tantalum-base superalloys is discussed and explored. A suite of alloys based on the Ta-Al-Co system was investigated. It was found that an array of fine carbide precipitates was formed in the Ta-rich matrix in a subset of the alloys, which is promising in terms of developing a strong and damage-tolerant microstructure, but that the elemental partitioning of Al out of the matrix accompanying precipitation is likely to degrade environmental resistance. Nevertheless, it is believed that the design principles described have the potential to facilitate the development of the next generation of high-temperature alloys based on systems of this type.

TI An overview of Na2SO4 and/or V2O5 induced hot corrosion of Fe- and
   Ni-based superalloys
SO REVIEWS ON ADVANCED MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Metals and alloys sometimes experience accelerated oxidation when their surfaces are covered with a thin film of fused salt in an oxidizing gas atmosphere at elevated temperatures. This is known as hot corrosion where a porous non-protective oxide scale is formed at the surfaces and sulphides in the substrate. Hot corrosion has been identified as a serious problem in high temperature applications such as in boilers, gas turbines, waste incinerations, diesel engines, coal gasification plants, chemical plants and other energy generation systems. It is basically induced by the impurities such as Na, V, S, K and Cl, which are present in the coal or in fuel oil used for combustion in the abovementioned applications. The use of Ni-, Fe- and Co- based superalloys in high temperature applications such as gas turbines, boilers, etc. is well known, and many more applications are still to be explored. Although the superalloys have adequate mechanical strength for such high temperature applications, they are prone to degradation by hot corrosion/high temperature oxidation during long term exposures. Therefore, the superalloys need to be protected, however the protection system must be practical, reliable, and economically viable. In this paper the hot corrosion phenomenon has been described in detail with a special reference to Fe- and Ni-based superalloys with the help of a survey of the available literature related to the hot corrosion of the superalloys, in the environments constituting mainly of Na2SO4 and/or V2O5.

AB The analytical limitations in atom probe tomography such as resolving a desired set of atomic planes, for solving complex materials science problems, have been overcome by employing a well-developed unique and reproducible crystallographic technique, involving synergetic coupling of orientation microscopy with atom probe tomography. The crystallographic information in atom probe reconstructions has been utilized to determine the solute site occupancies in Ni-Al-Cr based superalloys accurately. The structural information in atom probe reveals that both Al and Cr occupy the same sub-lattice within the Ll(2)-ordered gamma' precipitates to form Ni-3(Al,Cr) precipitates in a Ni-14Al-7Cr (at%) alloy. Interestingly, the addition of Co, which is a solid solution strengthener, to a Ni-14Al-7Cr alloy results in the partial reversal of Al site occupancy within gamma' precipitates to form (Ni, Al)(3)(Al,Cr,Co) precipitates. This unique evidence of reversal of Al site occupancy, resulting from the introduction of other solutes within the ordered structures, gives insights into the relative energetics of different sub-lattice sites when occupied by different solutes.

TI Formation and cyclic oxidation resistance of Hf-Co-modified aluminide
   coatings on nickel base superalloys
SO MATERIALS CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
AB The codeposition of Co, Al and Hf on nickel base superalloys by pack cementation in a single-step process was investigated in this work. Thermochemical analyses were applied to search for suitable conditions including pack composition and deposition temperature. Co, Al, Hf, NH4Cl, NH4I and Al2O3 made up the pack powder mixture. According to a series of thermochemical calculations, the pack powder mixture of 20Co-10Al-2Hf-4NH(4)Cl-4NH(4)I-60Al(2)O(3) (wt.%) was adopted. Further experimental results demonstrated that the codeposition of Co, Al and Hf could be achieved practically. The coating consisted of a diffusion zone and an outer layer. The outer layer was mainly composed of Al0.9Ni1.1 where a part of Ni was replaced by Co or Hf. The trace element Hf was enriched in the interface between the outer layer and the diffusion zone. The Co-Al-Hf coating exhibited excellent cyclic oxidation resistance due to improvement in adhesion between the oxide scale and the coating. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Mechanical and microstructural characterisations of NiCrCoAlYTa coatings
   on superalloys deposited by detonation gun technique
SO SURFACE ENGINEERING
AB The microstructure and mechanical properties of detonation gun sprayed NiCoCrAlYTa alloy coatings on the selected superalloys were investigated. The coatings were characterised in relation to thickness, porosity, microhardness, microstructure, compositions, and phases across by using the techniques such as optical microscopy, X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive analysis and X-ray mapping. The formation of spherical or elliptical shaped dendritic splats was observed in the as sprayed coatings on the superalloys. The splat morphology of the coatings is due to the deposition and re-solidification of successive molten or semimolten powder particles. The coatings showed a bond strength of 50 MPa and the surface roughness ( arithmetic average height) of the coatings was found to be in the range of 6(.)25-7(.)48 mm. The porosity and microhardness of the coatings were less than 0(.)48% and 385-748 Hv respectively. The XRD analysis of the coatings showed the phases gamma-Ni or gamma'- Ni3Al and beta-NiAl inter metallic as the minor phase.

SO SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF METALLURGY
AB A thermodynamic database has been developed for Ni-base superalloys. Following the CALPHAD procedure, it is based on the assessment of thermodynamic behaviour of the relevant constituting sub-systems of the complex system of interest. The current database contains 7 elements: Al, Co, Cr, Ni, Ti, W, Re. The thermodynamics of the gamma and gamma' phases are modelled with a single Gibbs energy function taking into account the crystallographic relation between these two phases. The formalism of the thermodynamic models used is briefly introduced. A few phase diagrams calculated with the current database in assessed binary and ternary systems are presented. Some experiments available in higher order systems are compared with the results of calculations with the current database. The ability of extrapolation of the database is verified for solid state equilibria as well as for solidification behaviour (liquidus temperature and partition ratios). The introduction of Mo and Ta to the current database is in progress. Other elements (Nb, Fe, Zr, Hf, C, B, . . .) are planed to be introduced.

Based on the molar Gibbs energy of the pure Re updated in SGTE Pure 5 database, the Re-X(X = Al, Co, Cr, Ta) systems were re-optimized by means of CALPHAD (CALculation of PHAse Diagrams) technique. In the present work, the phases liquid, fcc, bcc and hcp were described using a substitutional solution model. The phases AlRe, Al3Re, Al6Re, Al12Re, AlRe2 and Al11Re4 in the Re-Al system were described as stochiometric compound. The Al4Re_H and Al4Re_L instead of Al4Re were evaluated in the present work. The phases a in the Re-Cr and Re-Ta systems and chi in the Re Ta system were modeled as (X, Re)(10)(X, Re)(20) (X = Cr or Ta) and Re-24(Re, Ta)(10)(Re, Ta)(24), respectively. A set of self consistent thermodynamic parameters of the Re-X systems were obtained and the optimized results were in good agreement with the experimental data.

TI Microstructure, phase stability and element partitioning of gamma-gamma
   ' Co-9Al-9W-2X alloys in different annealing conditions
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB The phase stability, gamma' precipitate morphology and element partitioning behavior in dependence on temperature and alloying composition have been systematically investigated in Co-9Al-9W-2X alloys using electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and high-energy X-ray diffraction (HEXRD). The results show that the decomposition of the gamma' phase is promoted by adding some quaternary elements which increase the gamma' solvus temperature (except V). A larger lattice misfit in the Mo, V, Ti, Nb or Ta containing alloys can explain that coarser gamma' particles with a more cuboidal morphology were found in these alloys. Additional alloying elements and the annealing temperature show a stronger influence on the partitioning behavior of W between the gamma and gamma' phases compared to that of Co and Al. The partitioning tendency towards the g 0 phase decreases with increasing temperature for all investigated alloying elements except Cr. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Effect of solute segregation on the intrinsic stacking fault energy of
   Co-based binary alloys: A first-principles study
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Segregation of solute atoms to stacking faults (Suzuki segregation) and their interactions are of longstanding attention since it has a deep impact on mechanical properties. In this study, we systematically investigate the segregation behavior of different solute atoms in fcc Co-based binary alloys and its effect on the intrinsic stacking fault energy (SFE) using first-principles density-functional-theory (DFT) calculations. Interestingly, while Mo, W, Cr, Mn and Al atoms have a strong tendency to Suzuki segregation with some significant energy barriers, Ni atom has no tendency of segregation and only Fe atom has extremely low energy barriers. A strong segregation effect on the intrinsic SFE was observed and it only extends at a few atomic layers in the vicinity of the intrinsic stacking fault plane. The results are consistent with observed solute segregation in similar alloys and commercial superalloys then it would be useful for SFE modeling and Co-based alloys design. Furthermore, the effect of solute concentrations and changes in the electronic features (charge density difference and density of states) are also investigated. A mutual interaction between solutes and stacking faults enhanced local bonding between the solute atom and the adjacent Co atoms, resulted in the lower intrinsic SFE, thus favoring Suzuki segregation.

TI Effect of Co on Microstructure and Stress Rupture Properties of K4750
   Alloy
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA-ENGLISH LETTERS
AB The effects of substituting Co for Fe on the microstructure and stress rupture properties of K4750 alloy were studied. The microstructure of the alloy without Co (K4750 alloy) and the alloy containing Co (K4750-Co alloy) were analyzed. Substitution of Co for Fe inhibited the decomposition of MC carbide and the precipitation of eta phase during long-term aging treatment. In K4750-Co alloy, the morphology of MC carbide at the grain boundary (GB) remained dispersed blocky shape and no eta phase was observed after aging at 750 degrees C for 3000 h. However, in K4750 alloy, almost all the MC carbides at GBs broke down into granular M23C6 carbide and needle-like eta phase. The addition of cobalt could delay the decomposition of MC carbides, which accordingly restricted the elemental supply for the formation of eta phase. The stress rupture tests were conducted on two alloys at 750 degrees C/430 MPa. When Co is substituted for Fe in K4750 alloy, the stress rupture life increased from 164.10 to 264.67 h after standard heat treatment. This was mainly attributed to increased concentration of Al, Ti and Nb in gamma ' phase in K4750-Co alloy, which further enhanced the strengthening effect of gamma ' phase. After aging at 750 degrees C for 3000 h, substitution of Co for Fe can also cause the stress rupture life at 750 degrees C/430 MPa to increase from 48.72 to 208.18 h. The reason was mainly because MC carbide degradation and eta phase precipitation in K4750 alloy, which promoted the initiation and propagation of micro-crack during stress rupture testing.

TI Numerical simulation of microstructure evolution in Ni-based superalloys
   during P-type rafting using multiphase-field model and crystal
   plasticity
SO COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB During the service process, Ni-based superalloys undergo microstructure evolutions such as rafting, which greatly affect its service performance. In the present study, a multiphase-field model coupled with crystal plasticity was established to simulate the gamma/gamma' microstructure evolution of Ni-based superalloys during P-type rafting. The anisotropic plasticity considering 12 octahedral slip systems was defined in gamma matrix channel. The PanNickel (c) database was used to calculate thermodynamic and kinetic data for phase transition and diffusion in multicomponent superalloys. First, the model was validated by two benchmarks with and without consideration of external load respectively. Then, the anisotropic of slip systems was analyzed. It was found that eight slip systems A2, A3, B2, B4, C1, C3, D1, D4 were activated in gable channel first when the structure was compressed in [0 0 1] direction. Besides, the elements distribution was studied. It can be seen that Al, Ti, Ta diffused into precipitates while Co, Cr and Mo diffused away the roof channel when the structure was compressed in [0 0 1] direction. Re and W mainly distributed in the gamma/gamma' interface because their slow diffusion rate. Finally, the P-type raft of CMSX-4 superalloy was simulated, and the plasticity distribution and plastic behavior of the 12 slip systems were discussed. The current model can be used to simulate phase transformation of multicomponent superalloys where plasticity is strongly coupled.

AB The oxidation of multi-component alloys is complex and there are several competing oxidation reactions. This paper focuses on the oxidation performance of a gas.,turbine engine substrate, alloy 188. Co-Ni-Cr-W alloys can have a complex oxide structure that Vanes as a function of time and temperature. Alloy 188 was exposed in air at temperatures from 1050 to 1200 degrees C for up to 1500 h to determine its oxidation kinetics and to elucidate the form of damage accumulation.
   Previous results show parabolic corrosion kinetics at low (820 degrees C) temperatures and this work found similar kinetics above 1150 degrees C. However, in the mid temperature range, 1050-1100 degrees C, linear kinetics were observed.
   The performance of alloy 188 is of interest because of its use in turbines with oxidation resistant coatings designed to allow higher temperature operation than would normally be recommended.
   Because of the differing kinetics the lower temperature exposures give higher material loss than the higher temperature exposures at 1150 degrees C after 1500h. Rates of damage accumulation at 1050 degrees C were of the order of 10 mu m/h.

The multiple correlation coefficient was found to be R = 0.84; this indicates that alloy composition has a considerable relationship with the number of TMF cycles to failure. It was also found that the addition of Co, Ru and Al is effective to improve the TMF property. In addition, another multiple regression analysis was also carried out for the correlation between the number of TMF cycles to failure among high temperature mechanical properties and microstructural parameters.

   elements in sigma and gamma phases of Ni-based single crystal
   superalloys based on first principles
SO MATERIALS CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
AB The impurity formation energies of the sigma and gamma phases of Ni-based single crystal superalloys doped with W, Cr and Co in different sublattices have been investigated using first-principles based on the density functional theory. The bonding characteristics of the doped a phase were analyzed with the valence charge densities and the density of the states. The results of the calculations indicated that the typical refractory element W, which has a large atomic size, preferentially partitions into the sigma phase due to the nature of the bonding and the unique crystal structure with close-packed planes and large interstitial spaces. In addition, the site preference of refractory elements in gamma phase was in the order of W, Cr and Co. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Computational thermodynamics and genetic algorithms to design affordable
   gamma '-strengthened nickel-iron based superalloys
SO MODELLING AND SIMULATION IN MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
AB Computational thermodynamics based on the CALPHAD approach (Thermo-Calc software) are used to design creep-resistant and affordable superalloys for large-scale applications such as power plants. Cost is reduced by the introduction of iron and by avoiding the use of expensive alloying elements such as Nb, Ta, Mo, Co etc. Strengthening is ensured by the addition of W, and of Al and Ti to provoke the precipitation of gamma'. However, the addition of iron reduces the maximum possible volume fraction of gamma'. The latter is maximized automatically using a genetic algorithm during simulation, while keeping the alloys free of undesirable phases at high temperatures. New superalloys with 20 wt% Cr are designed, with Fe content up to 37 wt%. They should be forgeable, weldable, oxidation resistant and significantly cheaper than existing alloys with equivalent properties.

CY MAY 25-28, 2010
CL Wildbad Kreuth, GERMANY
AB Fourth generation superalloys are characterised by the addition of Ru which contributes to improved creep resistance whilst improving the microstructural stability. However, Ru additions have a negative effect on coated Ni-base superalloys, promoting Secondary Reaction Zone (SRZ) formation. Formation of a layer of SRZ beneath an aluminised or Pt-aluminised coating has the potential to reduce the effective cross section of a blade by in excess of 100 gm or 10% of the wall thickness. In this paper the effects of alloy composition on the formation of the SRZ in Pt-Aluminised fourth generation alloys were investigated systematically. A series of experimental fourth generation alloys was used having two distinct compositions of Co, Mo, W and Ru and conforming to a four factorial 'Design of Experiments' model. These alloys showed significant and consistent changes in the SRZ depending on alloy composition. These were in distinct contrast to the effects of these elements on stability in the bulk. Mo was demonstrated to be by far the most effective element suppressing SRZ formation, followed by Co. In contrast, both W and Ru enhance SRZ formation.

AB The density of liquid NiCoAlMo quaternary alloy with a fixed molar ratio of Ni:Co:Al (x(Ni):x(Co):x(Al)approximate to 73:12:15) which is close to the average value of the commercial Ni-based superalloys TMS75, INCO713, CM247LC and CMSX-4, and molybdenum concentration change from 0% to 10% (mass fraction) was measured by a modified sessile drop method. It is found that the density of the liquid NiCoAlMo quaternary alloy decreases with increasing of temperature, but increases with the increase of molybdenum concentration in the alloys. The molar volume of liquid NiCoAlMo quaternary alloy increases with the increase of temperature and molybdenum concentration, and shows a negative deviation from the ideal linear mixing. The liquid density of NiCoAlMo quaternary alloy calculated from the partial molar volumes of nickel, cobalt, aluminum and molybdenum in the corresponding Ni-bases binary alloy are in good agreement with the experimental results; it means that within the error tolerance range the density of liquid Ni-based multi-component alloys can be predicted from the partial volumes of elements in Ni-based binary alloys in liquid state.

SO MATERIALS LETTERS
AB The micro-segregation behavior of different oriented single crystal nickel based superalloys in directional solidification has been explored. The results show that the segregation level in the dendrite structure has relationship with the crystal orientation. in general, with increasing deviation angle from the < 001 > orientation, the segregation coefficients of Al, Ti and Ta increase, and the segregation coefficients of W and Co decrease. The segregation degree of Al, Ta, W and Co increases with the misorientation in the < 011 > oriented crystals, except for Ti. Segregation of Mo and Cr is less affected by the orientation variation. Different misorientations also lead to different segregation profiles. The crystal with smaller deviation angle from the < 001 > orientation has a shorter segregation distance. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB Nanostructural features of nickel-base superalloys as revealed by atom probe field ion microscopy (APFIM) and atom probe tomography (APT) are reviewed. The more salient information provided by these techniques is discussed through an almost exhaustive analysis of literature over the last 30 years. Atom probe techniques are shown to be able to measure the composition of tiny gamma' precipitates, a few nanometers in size, and to reveal chemical order within these precipitates. Phase separation kinetics in model NiCrAl alloys was investigated with both 3DAP and Monte-Carlo simulation. Results are shown to be in good agreement. Plane by plane analysis of {001} planes of Ni3Al-type gamma' phase makes it possible to estimate the degree of order as well as the preferential sites of various addition elements (Ti, Cr, Co, W, Ta, Re, Ru, etc.) included in superalloys. Clustering effects of Re in the gamma solid solution were also exhibited. Due to its ultrahigh depth resolution, the microchemistry of interfaces and grain boundaries can be characterized on an atomic scale. Grain boundaries in Astroloy or N18 superalloys were found to be enriched in B, Mo, and Cr and Al depleted.

TI Corrosion behaviour assessment of cast and HIPed Stellite 6 alloy in a
   chloride-containing environment
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB Cobalt-base (Stelae) alloys have seen extensive use in wear environments mainly due to their high strength, corrosion resistance and hardness. Co-base superalloys rely primarily on carbides formed in the Co matrix and at grain boundaries, for their strength and wear resistance. The distribution, size and shape of carbides depend on processing conditions. Currently, the use of Stellite alloys has extended into various industrial sectors (e.g. pulp and paper processing, oil and gas processing, pharmaceuticals, chemical processing) and the need for improved information regarding corrosion of Stellite alloys has increased. It has been recognized that processing changes, which affect the microstructure of Stellite alloys, most affect corrosion resistance.
   In this work the corrosion behaviour of Stellite 6 alloy in the as-cast and the HIPed consolidated forms is compared and contrasted using DC and AC electrochemical techniques in static saline conditions. The results show that there is a significant difference in the corrosion performance of HIP consolidated Stellite 6 and it is possible to link the corrosion behaviour to the microstructure. The benefits of using HIPing as a manufacturing process for the corrosion performance of Stellite 6 are discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Low-activity aluminide coatings for superalloys using a slurry process
   free of halide activators and chromates
SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB Slurry aluminide coatings have been well known for a number of years and are widely used to protect metallic surfaces from oxidation and corrosion. A variety of commercial slurries is available to aluminize the surfaces of nickel-based superalloys, however, they have several disadvantages. They contain environmentally harmful substances such as chromates or halides which are used as binders or to activate the diffusion species. Additionally, up to now slurry coatings were only used to produce precipitate-rich coatings, with a microstructure comparable to high aluminum activity coatings produced by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) like pack cementation.
   In this work these limitations have been overcome by carefully designing the powder composition of the slurry. Three different nickel-aluminide coatings were developed and applied onto CM-247 nickel-based alloy and Pt-diffused CM-247. By addition of chromium we achieved coatings with a similar microstructure and Al-content (of around 40 at.%), comparable to the state of the art low-activity coatings produced by CVD. Co-deposition of silicon was also achieved in a single step, maintaining the low-activity structure by combining Al-Si powder and chromium. Furthermore, this coating procedure was combined with a platinum electrodeposition step in order to produce single phase Pt-modified low-activity aluminide coatings. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

TI Combined phase-field crystal plasticity simulation of P- and N-type
   rafting in Co-based superalloys
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB We combine a phase-field model with a crystal plasticity model to simulate the microstructural evolution during creep in the Co-based superalloy ERBOCo-2Ta. Three-dimensional simulations of tensile and compressive creep tests in [100] direction were performed to study the rafting behavior in Co-based superalloys. The loss of coherency between gamma matrix and gamma' precipitate, which is essential for the understanding of rafted structures, is modeled in relation to the dislocation activity in the gamma-channels. Special attention is given to the interplay between creep deformation and microstructure stability. Appropriate constitutive modeling is applied to simulate realistic microstructure evolution under creep conditions. Thus, with the removal of the misfit stress, gamma' precipitates lose their cuboidal shape and form rafts. During N-type rafting more gamma' precipitates coalesce than during P-type rafting. The gamma' volume fraction during rafting increases under tensile stress but decreases under compressive stress. The morphological evolution of gamma' precipitates under tensile and compressive stresses in Co-based superalloy is consistent with the rafting characteristics in experimental observations.

AB The surface states of twelve chromia-forming simple alloys based on Co, Ni and Fe oxidized during 50 hours at 1000 degrees C, 1100 degrees C and 1200 degrees C were examined. The nickel alloys display an external scale that is essentially chromia. The oxides present on the surfaces of the iron base and cobalt base alloys are more complex. The depths of the carbide-free zones that developed from the surface increase when the initial carbide fraction of the alloys decreases, and there is always a part of chromium supplied on the oxidation front by dissolving carbides. Hence the mass of carbon released by the latter must be taken into account in the mass gain results to get more precise values of the Kp and Kv rate-constants. The treatment according to the d(Delta m/S)/dt versus 1/(Delta m/S) plot may not be really correct when the external oxides are of several types. It is possible that chromia volatilization could be limited by the presence of Fe in the Cr-containing M2O3 oxides or of covering parts of CoO.

AB In this study, Al-Co-Ni ternary alloys were synthesized, in order to obtain low-cost starting material for Ni-based superalloy production, by a self-propagating high temperature synthesis (SHS) both under normal gravity conditions (a = 9.81 m/s(2)) and under high gravity conditions (up to 1000 g-force) by using a centrifugal machine. The mixture of Co3O4-NiO powder were reduced by Al powder for the production of SHS alloys with the estimated compositions of 5-10 mass% Al, 20-65 mass% Co, 25-75 mass% Ni. The effect of green mixture compositions and centrifugal overload on combustion temperature, alloy/slag separations, chemical composition and microstructure of final alloys were investigated. The chemical analysis results showed that production of SHS alloys were achieved by having up to 86.12% of Co and 92.32% of Ni recoveries. The highest metal recovery value was obtained in SHS alloy with the estimated composition of 10%Al-65%Co-25% Ni by the addition of 20% Al2O3 into the green mixture. The metal/slag separation efficiency increased by increasing the centrifugal overload.

The statistical analysis showed that Al and Ta generally improve the oxidation resistance of the alloy, whereas Ti and Mo degrade the oxidation resistance. Co, Cr, and W did not alter oxidation rate significantly when examined by the mass gain averaged for all model alloys. However, it is remarkable that the degree of the effects of alloying elements varied with the concentration of other elements. Further, the effect of each element was sometimes found to be reversed for alloy groups specified by the concentration of another element.

   RR3000 and CMSX-4
SO CORROSION ENGINEERING SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB This paper describes the oxidation behaviour of two technologically important nickel based superalloys, RR3000 and CMSX-4, used extensively in gas turbine blade applications. Oxidation tests were conducted in air at 1100 degrees C for equal and extended periods of time, up to 100 h to compare the superalloys characteristic properties. The morphology of oxide growth in the test samples was investigated using metallography, SEM, EDX, X-ray diffraction ( XRD) and Cr3+ photoluminescence spectroscopy. The results indicated that irrespective of the duration of exposure, alloy RR3000 develops a much thicker oxide scale than alloy CMSX-4. Examination of cross-sections revealed that the scale grown on the alloy RR3000 is porous and has a three layered structure consisting of an outer layer of ( Ni,Co)O; a sublayer of CrTaO4 rich oxide with different spinels; and an inner layer of alpha-Al2O3. By contrast, the scale that forms on alloy CMSX-4 is compact and consists of two layers. The upper layer is primarily composed of spinels ( Ni, Co) Al2O4 and ( Ni,Cr)(2)O-4, and the inner layer of alpha-Al2O3. Residual stress measurements using luminescence spectroscopy point to a weak adhesion of the oxide scale to the substrate for alloy RR3000 and a strong adhesion for alloy CMSX-4.

TI CORROSION OF NICKEL, IRON, COBALT AND THEIR ALLOYS IN MOLTEN-SALT
   ELECTROLYTES
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB The processes of high-temperature corrosion, anodic dissolution and passivation of nickel, iron, cobalt and their alloys are reviewed to reveal the progress in understanding the reaction mechanisms defined in the last two decades. In the first part, the procedures of thermodynamical analysis of corrosion processes by potential - pO(2-) diagrams are outlined. The second part is devoted to the electrochemical corrosion, anodic dissolution and passivation of the metals studied, the reaction mechanisms and composition of the corrosion layers formed. The effect of the alloying elements on the corrosion resistance and anodic behaviour of the base metal is treated in the third part. A brief summary of the kinetics of the so-called ''hot corrosion'' of the studied metals and their alloys in contact with thin molten salt films and aggressive atmospheres is then given. Finally, some conclusions are drawn and some future trends of investigation are indicated.

TI Phase equilibria in Co-rich region of Co-Ti-Ta system
SO TRANSACTIONS OF NONFERROUS METALS SOCIETY OF CHINA
AB The phase equilibria in Co-rich region of Co-Ti-Ta system were studied. The microstructure and XRD analysis together with EDS determination show that L1(2) type Co(3)Ti phase and Laves_C36_Co(3)Ta phase get equilibrium with alpha-Co phase from 1 000 to 1 200 degrees C. The Co(3)Ti phase possesses a solubility of Ta higher than 10%, and the addition of Ta stabilizes the Co(3)Ti phase. The isothermal sections of the Co-Ti-Ta system in the Co-rich region at 1 000, 1 100 and 1 200 degrees C were constructed according to the result.

TI The effect of Ni additions on the oxidation behaviour of Co-Re-Cr
   high-temperature alloys
SO MATERIALS AT HIGH TEMPERATURES
AB The present study focused on the influence of Ni on the microstructure and oxidation behaviour of Co-Re-Cr-based alloys. Alloys with three different Ni contents were tested in laboratory air at 800-1100 degrees C. A refinement and a reduction of the sigma phase volume fraction as well as a change in the matrix microstructure were observed. Thermogravimetric measurements showed that the alloys with higher Ni contents possess a better oxidation resistance when exposed to higher temperatures. All alloys suffered from continuous mass loss during oxidation at 800 degrees C due to the formation of porous oxides scales, consisting of Co3O4, Co(Ni)O and Ni-doped CoCr2O4, which allow the evaporation of Re-oxides. At 900-1100 degrees C, only the alloy with 25 at. % Ni showed parabolic oxidation kinetics after a short period of transient oxidation. This is a result of the fast formation of a protective Cr2O3 layer. It was also found that exposure to air at 1000 degrees C leads to a phase transformation of the bulk material; an oxidation-induced formation of fine hexagonal close-packed (hcp) grains was observed near the oxide scales. It is supposed that the improved oxidation resistance of Ni-containing Co-Re-Cr alloys is a result of enhanced Cr diffusion caused by the Ni addition. The extensive formation of the fcc phase in the alloy matrix had a detrimental effect on the oxidation behaviour of the Ni-containing Co-Re-Cr-based alloys.

TI Effects of strain amount and strain rate on grain structure of a novel
   high Co nickel-based polycrystalline superalloy
SO MATERIALS & DESIGN
AB The development of nickel-based superalloys with high Co addition has aroused widespread interest recently owing to their potential application in hot sections of gas turbine. However, how hot working parameters impact the grain evolution of these superalloys remains to be studied systematically. In this work, high-throughput double cone ( DC) specimen, which yielded gradient strain at different regions in a single sample after hot compression, were designed to investigate the thermo-mechanical behaviors of a novel superalloy. Superslovus treatment was subsequently conducted to investigate the susceptibility to abnormal grain growth (AGG). By means of finite element simulation, transmission electron microscope (TEM), and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), it was found that slow strained DC was preferred to obtain a well-distributed grain structure after supersolvus annealing, owing to its adequate dynamical recrystallization (DRX) and dynamical recovery (DRV) during deformation.

AB Trace amounts of selenium and tellurium in nickel-based heat-resisting superalloys and constituent metals were separated by a reductive coprecipitation technique with palladium using ascorbic acid, and determined by electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry. Selenium and tellurium each added in 1 mu g amounts to solutions of metals (Ni, Al, Cr, Co, Cu, Mn, Mo, V, Ti, Nb, Ta, W and Zr), were recovered by the proposed method. In all metals, both selenium and tellurium were quantitatively recovered in H2SO4, H2SO4-tartaric acid, H2SO4-oxalic acid or H2SO4-H3PO4 solution. In Ni, Al, Nb, Ta, W and Zr, they were also quantitatively recovered in HF-H2SO4 solution. This proposed method could be adapted to determine trace amounts of selenium and tellurium in several alloys (heat-resisting superalloys, stainless steels and high speed steels).

SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB The oxidation resistance of Ni-Co-Cr-Al-W-Mo-Ta-Re-Ru alloys is evaluated by cyclic oxidation at 1100 degrees C and modelled using an artificial neural network. The database required for the modelling was constructed using design of experiment (the Box-Behnken method) followed by oxidation experiments. The obtained model with a 7-10-1 architecture exhibits consistent prediction of the experimental data (R = 0.999). Cr and Al enhance the oxidation resistance by promoting the formation of a protective NiA1204 layer. Mo and Ru are detrimental to the oxidation resistance.

TI Effect of Mo:W ratio on segregation behavior and creep strength of
   nickel-based single crystal superalloys
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB In past decades, molybdenum (Mo) has demonstrated the potential to replace tungsten (W) in designing lighter nickel-based single crystal superalloys with enhanced creep resistance. In this research, three groups of nickel-based single crystal superalloys are designed and prepared by tuning the Mo:W ratio. The experimental observations show that the primary and secondary dendrite arm spacings are both independent on Mo:W ratio, but the gamma/gamma' eutectic volume fraction decreases as Mo:W ratio increases. The electron probe microanalysis reveals that Re, W and Co segregate to dendrite core regions, while Al, Ti, Cr, Mo and Ta to interdendritic regions. The microsegregation of Ta, W and Re are gradually relieved with increasing Mo:W ratio. Atom probe tomography results further indicate that Cr and Mo are depleted in y/y' eutectics, leading to the enrichment of Cr and Mo at interdendritic regions away from gamma/gamma' eutectics. Creep rupture results show that the rupture life at 1040 degrees C/145 MPa is improved as Mo:W ratio increases.

TI Modeling of Thermal Expansion Coefficients of Ni-Based Superalloys Using
   Artificial Neural Network
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING AND PERFORMANCE
AB The objective of this work is to model the thermal expansion coefficients of various Ni-based superalloys used in gas turbine components. The thermal expansion coefficient is described as a function of temperature, chemical composition including Ni, Cr, Co, Mo, W, Ta, Nb, Al, Ti, B, Zr, and C contents as well as heat treatment including solutionizing and aging. Experimental values are well described and their relative changes well correlated by the model. Because gas turbine engine components operate under severe loading conditions and at high and varying temperatures, the prediction of their thermal expansion coefficient is crucial. The model developed in this work can be useful for design optimizations for minimizing thermo-mechanical stresses between the base alloys and potential protective coatings or adjacent components. It can substantially contribute to improve the performance and service life of gas turbine components.

TI Coupling between Re segregation and gamma/gamma ' interfacial
   dislocations during high-temperature, low-stress creep of a nickel-based
   single-crystal superalloy
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB The synergistic action of local elemental distribution, and in particular Re doping, with interfacial dislocations at the gamma/gamma' interface is still one of the most considered and unclear issues during creep of nickel-based single-crystal superalloys. In order to investigate this problem, a detailed characterization of interfacial dislocations in a DD6 superalloy after creep loading for 12 h at high temperature and low stress was carried out using transmission electron microscopy and high-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy techniques. In addition, the local elemental distribution near dislocation core regions was determined by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping. It was found for the first time that three types of interfacial protrusions are formed at the gamma/gamma' interface after creep loading for 12 h under conditions of high temperature and low stress and demonstrated that the formation of these features originates from dislocation motion. Additionally, EDS mapping provides evidence for co-segregation of Re with Cr and Co at the tip of the protrusions. Based on this, a model concerning dislocation core structure and dislocation climb was proposed to explain the different morphology of the protrusions. The observations highlight the importance of the coupling between Re segregation and gamma/gamma' interfacial dislocations for improving creep properties in nickel-based superalloys. The results of the study will be beneficial for the design of new high-temperature materials and for understanding the origin of the effect of Re additions in nickel-based single-crystal superalloys.

TI Brazing and wide gap repair of X-40 using Ni-base alloys
SO JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING FOR GAS TURBINES AND POWER-TRANSACTIONS OF THE
   ASME
AB Co-base superalloys are commonly used for vanes and parts of the combustion chamber in gas turbine engines. The Co-base superalloys are primarily solid solution strengthened and have good resistance to hot corrosion, creep, and thermal fatigue. In particular Co-base alloy X-40 was used to fabricate the first stage NGV airfoils of T56 series engines: inspections after service have revealed that X-40 airfoils suffered from severe thermal fatigue damages. In this study, a new braze repair scheme is proposed; in which Ni-base alloys are used to repair the X-40 substrate in both narrow and wide gap configurations. Metallographic examination, X-ray mapping, and energy dispersive Spectroscopy semiquantitative compositional analyses were carried out to study the microstructures in the braze joint in the as-brazed condition and after thermal exposure at 950 degrees C. The results obtained so far suggest the formation of Cr-rich borides, eutectic phases, and various carbides in the joint. No TCP phases were found in the brazed joint and base metals adjacent to the joint. The high carbon content in the alloy X-40 may have played an important role in preventing the formation of TCP phases,during brazing and subsequent thermal exposure.

TI Energetics of cobalt alloys and compounds and solute-vacancy binding in
   fcc cobalt: A first-principles database
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB Using extensive first-principles density functional calculations, we calculate thermodynamic properties of binary fcc cobalt-based alloys with 25 different solute elements. For each solute element X, we calculate its (a) nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor solute-vacancy binding energy, (b) dilute impurity mixing energy with respect to the equilibrium and hypothetical fcc-based reference states of the solute, (c) enthalpy of formation of cobalt-rich binary ordered compounds in the Co-X system, (d) solubility enthalpy, and other derived quantities. We find that the solute-vacancy binding energies of all the studied solutes in fcc cobalt are positive (indicating favorable binding), in contrast to nickel, aluminum, magnesium, and copper-based alloys, where mid 3d transition metal solutes have unfavorable solute -vacancy binding. We study the physical and chemical effects influencing solute-vacancy binding energy, and find that (a) it correlates broadly with solute size larger solute atoms possess stronger binding with vacancies and this is understood in terms of strain relief and secondary next-nearest-neighbor interactions, and (b) it follows a parabolic trend as a function of d-occupancy across the transition metal series falling to a minimum at the middle of the series and this is understood in terms of a d band filling effect. We also find this d-band filling effect in other calculated quantities such as the dilute impurity volumes and dilute impurity mixing energies. To aid in building thermodynamic databases, we tabulate all the calculated thermodynamic quantities, and compare them with experimental phase diagrams data and previous literature, and find good agreement where such data is available.

AB Long-term creep and rupture data of NIMS Creep Data Sheets show that the time to rupture at a minimum creep rate of 10(-5) %/h is longer than 105 h for most ferritic steels, while it is shorter than 105 h for most austenitic steels, Ni base and Co base superalloys. This is correlated with the larger total elongation in ferritic steels than in austenitic steels and in Ni base and Co base superalloys at a minimum creep rate of 10(-5)%/h. However, 67% of the average stress to cause rupture at the end of 105 It is lower than the stress to produce a minimum creep rate of 10-5 %/h for all the materials examined. This indicates that the ASME allowable stress in a high-temperature creep region is determined by creep rupture data but not by creep strain data. The creep and creep rate curves are compared between 2.25Cr-1Mo steel and 18Cr-8Ni austenitic steel at approximately the same minimum creep rate. 18Cr-8Ni austenitic steel reaches a minimum creep rate in shorter time and spends shorter time in the acceleration creep before creep rupture than 2.25Cr-1Mo steel at low stress and long time conditions. This is correlated with different microstructure evolution during creep. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Since the discovery [1] of gamma' precipitate (L1(2) - Co-3 (Al, W)) in the Co-Al-W ternary system, there has been an increased interest in Co-based superalloys. Since these alloys have two phase microstructures (gamma + gamma') similar to Ni-based superalloys [2], they are viable candidates in high temperature applications, particularly in land-based turbines. The role of alloying on stability of the gamma' phase has been an active area of research. In this study, electronic structure calculations were done to probe the effect of alloying in Co3W with L1(2) structure. Compositions of type Co-3(W, X), (where X/Y = Mn, Fe, Ni, Pt, Cr, Al, Si, V, W, Ta, Ti, Nb, Hf, Zr and Mo) were studied. Effect of alloying on equilibrium lattice parameters and ground state energies was used to calculate Vegard's coefficients and site preference related data. The effect of alloying on the stability of the L1(2) structure vis a vis other geometrically close packed ordered structures was also studied for a range of Co3X compounds. Results suggest that the penchant of element for the W sublattice can be predicted by comparing heats of formation of Co3X in different structures.

TI Effect of gamma ' volume fraction for creep strength of Ni-base
   superalloys at 800 degrees C
SO JOURNAL OF THE JAPAN INSTITUTE OF METALS
AB The creep behavior of Ni-base single-crystal superalloys TMS-75 and TMS-26 with various gamma' fractions was investigated at 800 degrees C and 735 MPa. Creep strength of two-phase alloys was superior to single phase alloys. The creep rupture lives were the longest for the 60% gamma' alloys. In contrast with creep behavior above 900 degrees C, 40% gamma' alloys were stronger than 80% gamma' alloys at 800 degrees C. 60% gamma' alloy of TMS-26 was much stronger than that of TMS-75 because of lower Co and Re contents and lower stacking fault energy. Changes in the microstructure after creep rupture were studied. While raft structure was observed perpendicular in 60% gamma' alloy of TMS-26, rafts were parallel in 80% gamma' alloy. Super stacking faults were often observed in gamma' precipitates in 60% gamma' alloy of TMS-75. However, super stacking faults were not frequent in the other alloys. Usual a/2 < 110 > dislocations were observed in gamma matrix in 20 and 40% gamma' alloys, and superdislocations were observed in coarse gamma' phases in 80% gamma' alloy.

TI A ternary Ni-Al-W EAM potential for Ni-based single crystal superalloys
SO PHYSICA B-CONDENSED MATTER
AB Based on experiments and first-principles calculations, a ternary Ni-Al-W embedded-atom-method (EAM) potential is constructed for the Ni-based single crystal superalloys. The potential predicts that W atoms do not tend to form clusters in gamma(Ni), which is consistent with experiments. The impurity diffusion of W in gamma(Ni) is investigated using the five-frequency model. The diffusion coefficients and the diffusion activation energy of W are in reasonable agreement with the data in literatures. By W doping, the lattice misfit between the two phases decreases and the elastic constants of gamma'(Ni3Al) increase. As for alloyed elements Co, Re and W, the pinning effect of solute atom on the gamma(Ni)/gamma'(Ni3Al) misfit dislocation increases with the increasing of the atomic radius. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

TI Strengthening Effect of Alloying Elements on Powder Metallurgical FGH97
   Superalloys
SO RARE METAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING
AB Based on typical FGH97 components, three P/M superalloys were designed and prepared by modifying alloying elements contents of Co, Cr, Mo and W. The strengthening effect of alloying elements on FGH97 was investigated. The results show that after modifying four alloying elements contents, the lattice parameters of gamma phases increase which enhances the effect of solid solution strengthening, and absolute values of gamma/gamma' misfit increase which enhances coherent strain strengthening. However, there is no precipitation strengthening or grain boundary strengthening. Solid solution strengthening makes the largest contribution to the increment of tensile strength at room temperature.

   of Mar-M247 superalloys with Ni-Cr-Co-W-Ta-B interlayer
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY
AB The three-stage isothermal solidification process of TLP bonded Mar-M247 nickel-based superalloy was studied. The transient liquid phase bonding of Mar-M247 superalloys was conducted at 1150 degrees C for 1,60, 120 and 240 min. Dendritic formation and solute partitioning governed the microstructure development. Ni-rich solid solution, Ni-rich boride W-rich boride and other carboborides were formed in the joint area. The maximum tensile strength of 443 MPa was obtained when TLP bonding at 1150 degrees C for 240 min. It had completed isothermal solidification. After isothermal solidification, the distribution of microhardness across the joints was more homogeneous. Enrichment of refractory elements in the Ni-Cr-Co-W-Ta-B interlayer was detrimental to the process of isothermal solidification. The presence of hard and brittle borides reduced the hardness and tensile strength of the bonded area. Post-bonding heat treatments are suggested to improve mechanical properties in future studies.

AB The demand for higher engine operating temperatures to improve aeroengine efficiency has meant that increasing levels of alloying additions are being added to single-crystal nickel-base superalloys for turbine blades applications. Whilst better mechanical and environmental performance may be obtained with these alloying additions, they also destabilise the alloys forming topologically closed-packed (TCP) phases. In this study, the formation of TCP phases has been studied in a series of four alloys designated LDSX1-4 which have a systematic variation in the levels of Co, Mo and W. The alloys were exposed to elevated temperatures between 900-1100 degrees C for up to 1000 hours. This was followed by detailed analysis of the microstructures in the SEM. Identification of the TCP phases in selected alloys was also carried out. The effects of each alloying addition on TCP phase formation is discussed in light of these results.

SO METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND
   MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Co-Re alloy development is prompted by the search for new materials for future gas turbines which can be used at temperatures considerably higher than the current day single crystal Ni-based superalloys. The Co-Re-based alloys have been designed to have very high melting range, and they are meant for application at + 373 K (+100 degrees C) above Ni-superalloys. They are significantly different from the conventional Co-based alloys that are used in static components of today's gas turbines, and the Co-Re alloys have never been used for structural applications before. The Co-Re-Cr system has complex microstructure with many different phases present. Phase transformations and stabilities of fine strengthening precipitates at high temperatures remain mostly unexplored in the Co-Re alloys, and to develop basic understanding, model ternary and quaternary compositions were studied within the alloy development program. In situ neutron and synchrotron measurements at high temperatures were extensively used for this purpose, and some recent results from the in situ measurements are presented. In particular, the effect of boron doping in Co-Re alloys and the stabilities of the fine TaC precipitates at high temperatures were investigated. A fine dispersion of TaC precipitates strengthens some Co-Re alloys, and their stabilities at the application temperatures are critical. In the beginning, the alloy development strategy is very briefly discussed. DOI: 10.1007/s11661-012-1363-6 (C) The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society and ASM International 2012

TI Comprehensive first-principles study of transition-metal substitution in
   the gamma phase of nickel-based superalloys
SO CALPHAD-COMPUTER COUPLING OF PHASE DIAGRAMS AND THERMOCHEMISTRY
AB In order to elucidate the role of various M-alloying additions in the fcc-type gamma phase of nickel-based superalloys, we have performed a comprehensive and systematical computation on all 3d-, 4d- and 5d-M alloying additions substituting in the Ni lattice using the same standard of the first-principles calculations within the framework of the density functional theory. The results show that the substitution enthalpies of Sc, Ti, V, Mn, Fe, Co, Zn, Zr, Nb, Hf, Ta, and Pt are negative, while the others elements have positive substitution enthalpies. To further explore the contributions of various factors to the substitution enthalpy, we have attempted to divide the substitution enthalpy into two parts. The first one is the mechanical deformation energy caused by the atomic volume change because of the M-alloying additions substituting in fcc Ni and the other one is the chemical and magnetic energy through electronic hybridizations and local magnetic interactions. It is found that the substitution enthalpy is a consequence of the balancing of these two contributions. Furthermore, we have attempted to correlate their mechanical deformation energies with metallic atomic radii of substitutional M-alloying addition with respect to Ni, and the chemical and magnetic energies with transferred charges between M-alloying addition and Ni, which are indeed associated with the so-called electronegativity difference.

AB The microstructure and tensile behaviour of Mo-doped Co-9Al-(9-x)W-2Ta-0.02B-xMo alloys (where x=0, 2, and 4 at% is hereafter referred to as 0Mo, 2Mo, and 4Mo alloys, respectively) at room and high temperatures have been investigated. Aged at 800 degrees C for 100 h, all alloys consist of a Co solid-solution gamma-Coss matrix and nano-scale cuboidal gamma'-Co-3(Al, W) intermetallic precipitates. The gamma matrix is coherent with the gamma-Co-3(Al, W) precipitates. With a coherent gamma/gamma'-Co3(Al, W) microstructure, the aged alloys show tensile yield strength anomalies at temperatures above 700 degrees C, and the 0Mo alloy always exhibits the highest strength at 600-800 degrees C. It is interesting that the alloys also possess anomalously low elongation of 0.4-3.3% at 600-800 degrees C, which is significantly below the similar to 10% elongation at room temperature. Intergranular cleavage is found to be the dominant failure mode of the gamma/gamma'-Co-3(Al, W) microstructure at high temperatures, resulting in tensile plasticity anomalies. At room temperature, however, slip bends are observed on the aligned gamma and gamma' phases, and the gamma/gamma'-Co-3(Al, W) coherent microstructure fails in a dimple mode with excellent elongation.

TI Development of wrought precipitation strengthened IN939 superalloy
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The potential of cast IN939 superalloy to be converted to wrought alloy has been explored in the present work. For this objective, bars of cast alloy were rolled under different conditions and then subjected to various heat treatment cycles. The results indicated that the yield strength, ultimate tensile strength and ductility of the wrought IN939 alloy are superior to the cast version. The stress rupture properties of wrought IN939 superalloy are better than those of the widely used superalloys, such as Nimonic 90 and Waspaloy, and approach the alloy Nimonic 105 properties. This is very notable because Nimonic 105 contains similar to 45 vol.-% gamma' that is much greater than the volume fraction of those strengthening precipitates in the alloy IN939 (similar to 35%). On the whole, the wrought form of this alloy has a high potential for manufacturing hot components to be used safely under aggressive turbine environment.

TI SULFIDATION-OXIDATION BEHAVIOR OF A NI-CO-CR-SI ALLOY IN AN SO2+O2
   ATMOSPHERE
SO OXIDATION OF METALS
AB The high-temperature-corrosion behavior of a Ni-Co-Cr-Si superalloy (HAYNES Alloy HR-160) in an SO2+O2 (SO2:O2=2:1) has been studied at 625-degrees-C and 750-degrees-C. Alloy samples were corroded for 72 hr, followed by XRD, SEM, EDS, and XPS analysis on the surface and/or cross-section of the samples, It was found that the simultaneous nucleation of nickel and cobalt oxides and chromia at the initial stage lead to the subsequent formation of a sulphate layer on reaction with the gas phase. This eventually lead to the formation of a thick sulphide layer above the chromia scale. The stable phases for Cr, Ni, and Co in such an atmosphere are chromia as well as Ni and Co sulphates. The existence of a thin sulphate layer was suggested some time ago but could not be detected and was disputed. The XPS analysis in this work now provides evidence for the existence of this sulphate layer. The transport of sulphur through the oxide scale into the alloy substrate is discussed It was concluded that sulphur advanced into the substrate by the oxidation of sulphides, thus liberating the sulphur. The possibility of sulphur transport in the form of SO2 molecules was also discussed. Based on the results and discussion, a schematic corrosion mechanism is presented.

TI Use of plasma spray technology for deposition of high temperature
   oxidation/corrosion resistant coatings - a review
SO MATERIALS AND CORROSION-WERKSTOFFE UND KORROSION
AB High temperature oxidation is one of the main failure modes of the hot-section components in gas turbines, boilers, waste incinerations, diesel engines, coal gasification plants, chemical plants and other energy generation systems. In such applications the use of Fe-, Ni- and Co-based alloys, especially of superalloys is well known. The superior mechanical strength and good corrosion resistance of the superalloys at high temperature make them favorites for such applications. However, the presence of combustion gases constitutes an extreme environment and hot corrosion is inevitable when superalloys are used at high temperatures for long durations of time. Therefore these alloys need to be protected against this type of oxidation. Several countermeasures have been suggested in the literature to combat the same. One such countermeasure against hot corrosion and oxidation constitutes the deposition of protective coatings on these alloys. Among the various techniques used for deposition of coatings, plasma spraying is a versatile technology that has been successful as a reliable cost-effective solution for many industrial problems. It allows the spraying of a wide range of high performance materials from superalloys and refractory intermetallic compounds to ceramics with continuously increasing commercial applications. Furthermore it does not cause deterioration of the substrate alloys, and relatively thick coatings can be formed with high deposition rates. In this paper the technique of plasma spraying has been detailed and the role of plasma sprayed coatings to arrest high temperature oxidation has been discussed with the help of a comprehensive literature survey. The main focus of this investigation is the studies related to plasma sprayed Ni-CrA1Y, Ni-Cr, Nickel aluminide and Co-based coatings.

TI Prospect of nickel-based superalloys with low Cr and high Re contents
SO ISIJ INTERNATIONAL
AB There is a clear trend of lowering Cr and increasing Re content in the evolution from the 1st- to the 2nd- and to the 3rd-generation Ni-based single crystal (SC) superalloys. Following this trend, two groups of superalloys were made with the aid of the d-electrons concept. One is the A-group which is characterized by the lower Cr and the higher Re contents in the alloys than in the 3rd-generation SC alloys. A homogeneous microstructure was obtained in these A-group superalloys containing 0, 1 and 2 mass% Cr, while their Re and Co contents were set at about 8.5 mass% and 13.5 mass% respectively. The other is the B-group which is characterized by the lower Re content than the A-group. Three alloys in the B-group containing 2.5, 4.2 and 12.1 mass% Cr were studied for the comparison with the A-group. According to a hot corrosion test, weight gain occurred in a Cr-free alloy instead of observing weight loss in Cr containing alloys. Hot corrosion resistance of 2 mass% Cr alloy was quite good as long as the alloy contains about 8.5 mass% Be. The oxidation resistance was improved remarkably in 1 mass% Cr alloy than in the Cr-free alloy. It was found that the addition of at least 2 mass% Cr into superalloys is necessary in order to keep good surface stability at high temperatures. Also, it was seen that Re is a harmful element for oxidation resistance.

   superalloy
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB The partitioning behaviors of alloying elements Cr, Co, Al, Ta, etc. on the gamma and gamma' phases of high Cr-containing (similar to 9wt.%) nickel-base single crystal superalloys have been investigated with and without the addition of 3wt.% Ru. The "reverse partitioning effect" occurs, which means that the addition of Ru causes the partition of Cr and Co into gamma' phase, while Al an Ta concentrate into gamma matrix. However, Ru promotes the precipitation of topologically close-packed (TCP) phases, since the diffusion coefficient between the TCP phase and the matrix interface increases with the diffusion behaviors of refractory elements. For the coarsening and slightly rafting of gamma' phases, the increase of elemental diffusion plays much more important role in its kinetic process than the decrease of lattice misfit.

This precipitate was identified as the hexagonal topologically close-packed (TCP) mu phase with lattice parameters a = 0.473 nm and c = 2.565 nm. The energy-dispersive x-ray (EDX) spectrum of the mu phase suggested a refractory element rich compound comprising the elements Re, W, and Co. Twin domains parallel to (001) were found in the mu phase. The mechanisms of the mu phase and twinning formation were discussed.

AB The Al/W ratio was increased in a new polycrystalline gamma/gamma' Co-based superalloy in order to introduce a grain boundary pinning phase while at the same time reducing the density and increasing the oxidation resistance. The grain boundary pinning phase was identified as beta-phase (B2-(Ni,Co)Al) by high-energy X-ray diffraction. The grain boundary pinning effect was confirmed to be effective up to temperatures of 1050 degrees C by synchrotron radiation in-situ heating experiments. The precipitation of the beta phase led to a reduced gamma' volume fraction thereby decreasing the high-temperature strength. The density was lowered to 8.52 g/cm(3), so the specific strength was equivalent to the strength of the reference alloy up to 750 degrees C. Due to the low gamma' volume fraction and the low W content, the creep resistance was also reduced compared with the reference alloy. The oxidation resistance, however, was improved by the formation of a thin, continuous Al-oxide layer during oxidation at 900 degrees C for 50 hours.

SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB Microstructural features of nickel base superalloys N18 have been investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), field emission gun-scanning electron microscopy (FEG-SEM), field ion microscopy (FIM), one-dimensional atom probe (APFIM) and three-dimensional atom probe (3DAP). Heat treatments conducted at 700 and 800 C lead to the precipitation of a large volume fraction of gamma precipitates (57%) that are Al and Ti enriched. Cr, Co and Mo preferentially partition to the gamma solid solution. Small Cr-enriched particles (0) were discovered in the core of largest gamma particles. These contain more Cr and less Mo than the gamma solid solution but are thought to be tiny metastable gamma particles that were formed in the inner region of gamma particles during cooling from 800 degreesC. Intergranular Ni-depleted borides arranged in "clusters" of particles very close to each other were observed using 3DAP. Their stoichiometry is M2B with M = Cr, Mo. One nanometer-thick Ni and Co enriched films (compared to borides) separate adjoining boride particles. Grain boundary (GB) segregation of B, Mo and to some extent Cr has been observed. The thickness of the segregated layer wetting GB is close to 1 nm. (C) 2002 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI On the Role of Superlattice Structures with Ni3X-type Composition in
   Selected Ni-Based Superalloys with Commercial Grades
SO METALLOGRAPHY MICROSTRUCTURE AND ANALYSIS
AB Close-packed superlattice derivatives of the face-centered cubic (fcc) structure with Ni3X-type composition in some commercial Ni-based superalloys have been characterized, and their effect on tensile strength has been determined. Both the L1(2) and DO22 superlattices can form directly from the fcc structure by minor atoms rearrangement. However, the two superlattices can act as transient metastable phases which transform into more stable superlattices (L1(2) -> DO24 and DO22 -> D0(a)) with extended thermal exposure at elevated temperatures. It is shown that the stability and morphology of each superlattice are dependent upon the alloy composition. Although some superlattices produce adverse effects on tensile strength, others are found to have beneficial effects. The exact effect is correlated with the particular morphology and deformation mode. It is concluded that the DO22 superlattice can form the basis for designing alloys deformable by twinning and combine high strength and high ductility.

TI Optimum microstructure combination for maximizing tensile strength in a
   polycrystalline superalloy with a two-phase structure
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB Different microstructural features were obtained under various heat treatment conditions, which provided insight into the factors controlling the critical strength in a polycrystalline Ni-Co-based disk superalloy (TMW-4M3 alloy) with a two-phase structure. The contribution of each microstructural feature, namely, the grain size, annealing twin boundary and distribution of gamma' precipitates, to the total strength was analyzed quantitatively by measuring the Vickers hardness over the nanometer to micron size range. Grain boundary strengthening decreased to nearly zero with increasing solution heat treatment temperature, while the secondary and tertiary gamma' precipitation hardening increased. Therefore, there is an optimum combination of microstructural features for achieving the highest tensile strength in such superalloys, the key factors being the temperature and time used for the solution heat treatment and the subsequent aging treatment. A method for determining the optimum factors for TMW-4M3 is proposed. (C) 2012 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Ni- and Co-BASED SUPERALLOYS AS POTENTIAL TOOL MATERIALS FOR
   THIXOFORMING OF STEELS
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MATERIAL FORMING
AB Thixoforming of steel is very demanding on tool materials. With process temperatures often exceeding 1300 degrees C, the surface-to-interior temperature gradients and the thermal stresses thus generated across the die are much larger than with Al and Mg. The principle die failure mechanism is thus claimed to be thermal fatigue as the mechanical loading on the tooling is modest owing to a mushy feedstock. The erosive wear caused by abrasion and impact of the already solid particles in the slurry and high temperature oxidation of the die surface, cannot be overlooked either. The conventional hot work tool steels were shown to rapidly deteriorate under such severe conditions. Suitable die materials with extended service life are required to set up an appropriate process for the production of steel parts on an industrial scale. Ni- and Co-based superalloys were tested in the present work for their potential to withstand the steel thixoforming environment for an economically acceptable life.

SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB Low cycle fatigue behavior was studied at 400,650 and 725 degrees C in the total strain ranges of 0.79-1.22% for a recently developed Ni-base superalloy containing high Co and Ti contents. Detailed examinations were conducted on cyclic hardening/softening behavior, deformation substructure, fatigue life, as well as crack initiation and subsequent propagation. Continuous cyclic hardening at 400 degrees C was observed whereas cyclic softening at 650 and 725 degrees C was examined, except at 650 degrees C and low strain range (0.8%) where alloy exhibited relative stable stress response until crack initiation. Transmission electron microscopy analysis suggests that cyclic hardening is caused by the inhomogeneous dislocation activity and interactions of dislocations, and cyclic softening is related to shearing of gamma prime precipitates by stacking faults and coupled dislocation pairs combining with thermal activation process. The relation between fatigue life and plastic strain followed the Coffin-Manson law. Fatigue cracks often initiated on or near the surfaces of specimen during cycling, while subsurface carbide clusters initiation was also observed. Oxidation accelerated crack propagation at 650 and 725 degrees C. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Interim results from the development of a polycrystalline Co-Al-W based superalloy are presented. Cr has been added to provide oxidation resistance and Ni has then been added to widen and stabilise the gamma' phase field. The alloy presented has a solvus of 1010 degrees C and a density of 8.7 g cm(-3). The room temperature flow stress is over 1000 MPa and this reduces dramatically above 800 degrees C. The flow stress anomaly is observed. A microstructure with both similar to 50 nm gamma ' produced on cooling and larger 100-200 nm gamma ' can be obtained. Isothermal oxidation at 800 degrees C in air for 200 h gave a mass gain of 0.96 mg cm(-2). After hot deformation in the 650-850 degrees C temperature range, both anti phase boundaries (APBs) and stacking faults could be observed. An APB energy of 71 mJm(-2) was measured, which is comparable to that found in commercial nickel superalloys.

AB The microstructural patterns formed during liquid to solid phase transformations control the properties of a wide range of materials. We developed a novel methodology that enables in situ quantification of the microstructures formed during solidification of high temperature advanced alloys via synchrotron tomography. The patterns formed are captured in 4D (3D plus time) using a methodology which exploits three separate advances: a bespoke high temperature environment cell; the development of high X-ray contrast alloys; and a novel environmental encapsulation system. This methodology is demonstrated on Ni, Fe, and Co advanced alloy systems, revealing dendritic pattern formation. We present detailed quantification of microstructural pattern evolution in a novel high attenuation contrast Co-Hf alloy, including microstructural patterning and dendrite tip velocity. The images are quantified to provide 4D experimental data of growth and coarsening mechanisms in Co alloys, which are used for a range of applications from energy to aerospace.

AB Design of advanced materials in general calls for better understanding of phase transitions at service temperatures and relevant equilibrium phase diagrams. In the case of multicomponent alloys, it is often necessary to study phase transformations on model systems. Ni-Al-Cr-X quaternary systems (X = Co, W, Ti, Ta, etc.) are relatively simple yet sufficiently representative models for Ni-base superalloys. However, their complete thermodynamic description requires qualified knowledge of thermodynamic parameters for lower order systems as well as higher order correction terms.
   This work continues our previous studies on Ni-Al-Cr-(Co, W, Mo) systems. This time it is focused on titanium as the fourth element. Experimental alloys were prepared with respect to gamma + gamma' phases presence and studied by means of analytical electron microscopy after annealing at typical service temperatures. Experimentally identified types of phases are compared with those obtained by means of thermodynamic calculations. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The molybdenum content of CoMoP alloys is 0.7-1.0 at.% at 5 to 8 at.% P. The electrolytic tungsten alloys are nanocrystalline and subgrains are 4 to 7 nm in size. The nanohardness of tungsten-rich alloys similar to 13 GPa) is comparable with that of electrolytic chromium coatings. The wear resistance of the deposited alloys is quite high and is commensurable with that of hard coatings such as TiB2, TiN, and TiAlN. The tribooxidation of FeW alloys in dry friction is revealed. The corrosion resistance of the coatings is similar to that for electrolytic chromium.

AB Single-crystal elastic constants of Co-3(Al, W) with cubic L1(2) structure have been experimentally measured by resonance ultrasound spectroscopy at liquid helium temperature. The values of all three independent single-crystal elastic constants and polycrystalline elastic constants of Co-3(Al, W) experimentally determined are 15%-25% larger than those of Ni-3(Al, Ta) but are considerably smaller than previously calculated values of the constants. When judged from the values of Poisson's ratio, Cauchy pressure, and G(h)/B-h, the ductility of Co-3(Al, W) is expected to be sufficiently high so that Co-3(Al, W) can be practically used as the constituent phase of "Co-base superalloys."

TI Compositional effects on the cyclic oxidation resistance of conventional
   superalloys
SO MATERIALS AT HIGH TEMPERATURES
AB The 1100 degrees C cyclic oxidation performance of 25 Ni-base commercial and developmental alloys was compiled from an extensive database and ranked according to the 200 h weight change. Cyclic oxidation performance of superalloys is directly controlled by composition. These conventionally cast superalloys were composed of base elements [Ni-Co-Cr-Al], refractory elements [Nb-Mo-Ta-W], oxygen-active elements [Ti-Zr-Hf], light elements [B, C], and occasionally [V-Mn-Si], with P and S trace impurities. The oxidation results were broadly categorised as less than 4 mg/cm(2) weight loss for alloys with high 5-6% Al and 3-9% Ta, and with low <= 1% Ti ( wt.%). Conversely, weight loss of 200-300 mg/cm2 characterised alloys containing low < 3.5% Al, no Ta, and high > 3% Ti. These trends correlated with beneficial and detrimental scale phases previously reported. An unambiguous Cr effect was masked because of its strongly coupled, but inverse, correlation with Al. Multiple linear regression was used to fit alloy composition to a simple logarithmic weight change transform. The function contained 10 terms and yielded a correlation coefficient, r(2), of 0.84. Various graphical representations helped to further illustrate, quantify, and predict complex oxidation effects within a 10-element compositional space.

TI Compositional variations for small-scale gamma prime (gamma ')
   precipitates formed at different cooling rates in an advanced Ni-based
   superalloy
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB Size-dependent compositional variations under different cooling regimes have been investigated for ordered L1(2)-structured gamma prime (gamma') precipitates in the commercial powder metallurgy Ni-based superalloy RR1000. Using scanning transmission electron microscope imaging combined with absorption-corrected energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, we have discovered large differences in the Al, Ti and Co compositions for gamma' precipitates in the size range 10-300 nm. Our experimental results, coupled with complementary thermodynamic calculations, demonstrate the importance of kinetic factors on precipitate composition in Ni-based superalloys. In particular, these results provide new evidence for the role of elemental diffusion kinetics and aluminium antisite atoms on the low-temperature growth kinetics of fine-scale gamma' precipitates. Our findings have important implications for understanding the microstructure and precipitation behaviour of Ni-based superalloys, suggesting a transition in the mechanism of vacancy-mediated diffusion of Al from intrasublattice exchange at high temperatures to intersublattice antisite-assisted exchange at low temperatures.

TI Microstructural Observations on Oxidized Ni-Based Superalloy TMS-75 and
   PGM-Doped Derivatives
SO JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB The isothermal oxidation behavior of experimental third and fourth generation Ni-based superalloys was studied at temperatures between 900 and 1100 degrees C. It was found that the lower Cr concentration in third and fourth generation alloys compared to second generation alloys negatively affects the ability of the alloy to form and maintain a protective alumina scale especially at lower temperatures (900 degrees C). An extensive internal reaction zone comprised of oxide and nitride phases is observed underneath a nonprotective external oxide scale. At higher temperatures, a continuous alumina scale forms underneath (Ni,Co)O and spinel layers. Due to the low level of reactive element (RE) additions in these experimental alloys, scale adhesion is poor. An increase of Cr content is necessary to ensure formation of a protective alumina scale at lower temperatures. Addition of Y and/or Zr is recommended for improved oxide adhesion, resulting in better overall oxidation performance. (C) 2010 The Electrochemical Society.

AB The Co-Ta system has been reviewed and the thermodynamic description was re-assessed in the present work. DFT (density functional theory) calculations considering spin polarization were performed to obtain the energies for all end-member configurations of the C14, C15, C36 and mu phases for the evaluation of the Gibbs energies of these phases. The phase diagram calculated with the present description agrees well with the experimental and theoretical data. Considering the DFT results was essential for giving a better description of the mu phase at lower temperatures.

AB The phase equilibria of Co-base trial alloys of Co-9Al-7.5W, Co-5.5Al-10W and Co-9Al-3W at 1300 degrees C and 900 degrees C were determined in the present investigation. The experimental alloys were gamma single-phase alloys at 1300 degrees C, although the existence of the gamma' phase and the epsilon phase was identified due to cooling effect. The nearly cuboidal gamma' phase and the plate-like DO19 phase in alloys 9Al-7.5W and 5.5Al-10W were coarsened after long-term annealing at 900 degrees C. It is suggested that the alloy 9Al-7.5W was in gamma+gamma' two-phase region, while the alloys 5.5Al-10W and 9Al-3W were in gamma+DO19 two-phase region and gamma singe-phase region at 900 degrees C, respectively.

TI Exploration of crystal structure and the origin of unexpected intrinsic
   ductility of chi Co7Ta2
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB The precise information on phase constitutions in the Co-Ta system is of practical significance for exploiting g 0 gamma'-strengthened Co-Ta-based superalloys. The unidentified crystal structure of chi Co7Ta2 and the ambiguous description of phase relationship between chi Co7Ta2 and g gamma'Co3Ta result in the uncertainty of phase constitutions in the Co-rich region of Co-Ta. In this work, we present a systematical study of crystallographic data of Co7Ta2 on the basis of first principles and an unbiased structure searching method. A layered-sandwich structure with C2/m monoclinic symmetry (Pearson symbol mC18) is identified for Co7Ta2. The thermodynamic, mechanical and phonon calculations further verify the stability of C2/m. The quasi-harmonic thermodynamics exhibit that Co3Ta is stable and Co7Ta2 should be metastable at ambient temperature. The entropy effect remarkably stabilizes Co7Ta2 but destabilizes Co3Ta phase. The Co7Ta2 would be the thermodynamically stable at T >= 1200 K. Further results of mechanical properties show that Co7Ta2 yields an unexpected intrinsic ductility. Through the electronic configurations, it demonstrates that the ductility is associated with the bonding alteration in the specific layered-sandwich structure of Co7Ta2 during deformation process.

SO INTERMETALLICS
AB Three compositions of Re containing Co-Ti-based alloys with gamma/gamma' two-phase microstructure were obtained based on the determined phase relationship in the Co-rich corner at 800 degrees C. The effect of Re on microstructure, elemental partition behavior, thermodynamic properties, lattice parameter misfits, mechanical properties and gamma' coarsening behavior of the Co-Ti-Re alloys were investigated. The gamma/gamma' lattice parameter misfit of the alloys decreases from 0.72% to 0.50%, and the gamma' coarsening rate constant K of alloys decreases from 0.30 x 10(-27) m(3) s(-1) to 0.073 x 10(-27) m(3) s(-1) as Re content increasing form 1 at. % to 5 at. %. Additionally, the volume fraction of gamma' phase (V-gamma') increases from 42.15% to 53.19% and the gamma' solvus temperature increases from 1059 degrees C to 1085 degrees C (Tsolvus-gamma') with increasing Re content. Moreover, the 0.2% flow stresses and the 0.2% specific flow stresses of all three alloys exhibit negative temperature dependence at the temperatures ranging from room temperature to 900 degrees C. And both the 0.2% flow stresses and the 0.2% specific flow stresses increase with the Re content.

TI High temperature corrosion behaviour of some Fe-, Co- and Ni-base
   superalloys in the presence of Y2O3 as inhibitor
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB High temperature corrosion is accelerated degradation of materials at higher temperatures of operation caused by the presence of a deposit of salt or ash. Inhibitors and fuel additives have been investigated with varying success to control this type of corrosion. In this work, effect of an oxide additive namely Y2O3 on the hot corrosion behaviour of some superalloys viz Superfer 800H (alloy A), Superco 605 (alloy B) and Superni 75 (alloy C) has been investigated in an Na2SO4-60%V2O5 environment at 900 degrees C for 50 cycles. Each cycle consisted of 1 h heating in a Silicon Carbide Tube Furnace followed by 20 min cooling in ambient air. Weight data were taken by an electronic balance having an accuracy of 0.01 mg after each cycle. Subsequently, the exposed alloys were characterized by XRD, SEM and EPMA analyses to evaluate the role of the oxide additive. In the Na2SO4-60%V2O5 environment, the corrosion rate for the Co-base alloy was found to be highest, whereas that for the Ni-base Superni 75 the lowest. Superficially applied Y2O3 was observed to be useful in reducing the high temperature corrosion of the alloys. It was found to be most effective for the alloy A for which the oxide scale was continuous and rich in protective Cr. Alloy B showed the formation of medium size scale rich in Cr and Co. The oxide scale for the alloy C contained mainly Cr and Ni. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

The Co-Ta, Ni-Ta and Co-Ni-Ta systems were optimized using the CALculation of PHAse Diagram (CALPHAD) method based on the present experimental results and literature data. Three Laves phases lambda(1), lambda(2) and lambda(3) were described using a two-sublattice model (Co,Ni,Ta)(0.6667)(Co,Ni,Ta)(0.3333), and compound (Co,Ni)Ta was modeled as (Co,Ni,Ta)(1)Ta-4(Co,Ni,Ta)(2)(Co,Ni,Ta)(6) by a four-sublattice model. A set of reliable and self-consistent thermodynamic parameters was obtained, which can be used for a variety of thermodynamic calculations and database establishment of the Co-Ni-based superalloys.

Thin wall part with smooth surface was obtained by LENS of layer-by-layer deposition of the powder materials. This thin wall sample was tested for metallographic examinations, micro-hardness, X-ray diffraction and mechanical property test. Microstructural results show that the layers possess rapid solidification microstructural feature, fine dendritic crystal and M7C3-type carbides (essentially chromium-rich carbide) dispersed in the gamma(Co,Cr) phase matrix. Dendrite spacing as well as the solidification mode can be controlled through control process parameters. In addition, this microstructural feature of the as-formed Co-base sample leads to an evident hardening and a superior tensile strength and toughness.

AB Two levels of non-refractory (V and Ti) and refractory (Mo, Nb and Ta) alloying elements were added to Co-9Al-10W ternary alloy (at.%, baseline alloy) in order to investigate alloying effects on phase equilibria, microstructural features of gamma' phase and secondary phases at 1300 degrees C and 900 degrees C, respectively. It is suggested that refractory alloying additions promoted the precipitation of the mu phase at 1300 degrees C. The phase equilibria changed from gamma single-phase region in the baseline alloy to gamma+mu two-phase region in quaternary alloys containing high levels of refractory alloying elements (4 at.%) at 1300 degrees C. The mu phase was enriched in W, Mo, Nb and Ta, but depleted in AI, V and Ti. For quaternary alloys with low levels of alloying additions (2 at.%), the gamma/gamma' two-phase microstructure was observed after aging treatment at 900 degrees C for 50h and 300h, but small amounts of the plate-like DO19 phase precipitated in the matrix of 2Mo and 2Nb alloys. The volume fractions of the gamma' phase were at very high level in the range of 74% to 83% in all these experimental alloys. Compared with the baseline alloy, alloying additions did not show the strong effect on gamma' morphology, which remained cuboidal after long term aging except Mo addition. For quaternary alloys with high levels of alloying additions after aging at 900 degrees C, the DO19 phase precipitated in addition to gamma and gamma' phases, as well as the blocky mu phase inherited from the precipitation at 1300 degrees C. There were two types of the DO19 phase: one was plate-like and precipitated in the matrix; the other was blocky and transformed from the previous mu phase. Again, refractory alloying additions (Mo, Nb and Ta) promoted phase transformation for both types of the DO19 phase. The current study is helpful to understand phase equilibria and microstructure in Co-Al-W-base alloys and further develop multi-component gamma'-strengthened Co-base superalloys.

TI Tensile Behavior and Evolution of the Phases in the
   Al10Co25Cr8Fe15Ni36Ti6 Compositionally Complex/High Entropy Alloy
SO ENTROPY
AB Compositionally complex alloys, or high entropy alloys, are good candidates for applications at higher temperatures in gas turbines. After their introduction, the equiatomic Al17Co17Cr17Cu17Fe17Ni17 (at.%) served as a starting material and a long optimization road finally led to the recently optimized Al10Co25Cr8Fe15Ni36Ti6 (at.%) alloy, which shows promising mechanical properties. Investigations of the as-cast state and after different heat treatments focus on the evolution of the microstructure and provide an overview of some mechanical properties. The dendritic solidification provides two phases in the dendritic cores and two different ones in the interdendritic regions. Three of the four phases remain after heat treatments. Homogenization and subsequent annealing produce a -' based microstructure, similar to Ni-based superalloys. The phase is Co-Cr-Fe rich and the ' phase is Al-Ni-Ti rich. The understanding of the mechanical behavior of the investigated alloy is supported and enhanced by the study of the different phases and their nanohardness measurements. The observations are compared with mechanical and microstructural data from commercial Ni-based superalloys, Co-based alloys, and Co-Ni-based alloys at the desired application temperature of similar to 800 degrees C.

   KINETICS OF GAMMA' PHASE IN NICKEL-BASED WROUGHT SUPERALLOYS
SO ZEITSCHRIFT FUR METALLKUNDE
AB Formation kinetics of gamma (Ni3Al) phase in Ni-based wrought superalloys were investigated using the indirect measurement method of electrical resistivity change during isothermal holding.
   It was found that formation of gamma' phase occurs in a very short time (as a function of temperature and alloying level) by a diffusion controlled nucleation mechanism. Al alone enhances the formation of gamma' nuclei in the alloy and enlarges their quantity. On the other hand, addition of Ti or Ta causes delay in nucleation. Any other alloying addition (e.g. Co or W) delays the primary stage of nucleation. Ta was found to be more substantial than Ti in increasing nucleation rate and volume fraction of the gamma' phase.

SO JOURNAL OF THE JAPAN INSTITUTE OF METALS
AB The partitioning behavior of platinum group metals (PGM) into gamma matrix and gamma' precipitates for gamma' precipitation hardening Ni-base superalloys has been investigated using electron probe X-ray micro-analyzer (EPMA). The TMS-75 (Ni-12 mass% Co-3 mass% Cr-2 mass% Mo-6 mass% W-6 mass% Al-6 mass% Ta-5 mass% Re-0.1 mass% Hf) and five alloys with 1 at% PGM additions to TMS-75 were investigated. It became clear that in equilibrium state at 1100degreesC, It is slightly partitioned more into gamma' precipitates, Ru has a preference to partition into gamma matrix, in contrast Rh, Pd and Pt are partitioned into gamma' precipitates, and the partitioning ratio of these elements is about K-i(gamma/gamma) approximate to 1/2. Furthermore, it appears that the partitioning behavior of refractory elements, such as W, Re, are not so changed by PGM addition, for example, Re is partitioned into gamma matrix in any alloy (K-Re(gamma/gamma) is in range of 6 to 7.5).

TI Nano-twinning in a precipitate strengthened Ni-based superalloy
SO MATERIALS RESEARCH LETTERS
AB Twinning has been found to be a dominate mechanism in the precipitate strengthened Ni-based superalloys during service at intermediate temperatures. Here, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and atomistic simulations have been combined to show that the twin nucleation process can be facilitated by Co replacing a fraction of Al in the precipitates, due to the negative binding energy of Co-Co atoms. The study further reveals that the presence of Co promotes a new twinning pathway featured with nucleation of one complex stacking fault (CSF) on the middle plane in between two separated CSFs. IMPACT STATEMENTWe demonstrate that Co in the precipitates promotes a new twinning pathway featured with nucleation of one CSF on the middle plane between two separated CSFs.

AB Ni-Co-Cr-Al-Y-Si-B coatings were deposited on Ni base superalloys DZ125 and DSM11 by arc ion plating (AIP). The corrosion behaviours of DZ125, DSM11 and Ni-Co-Cr-Al-Y-Si-B coating in molten 75%Na2SO4+25%K2SO4 at 900 degreesC were studied. The results indicate that the coating can protect the DZ125 and DSM11 alloys from hot corrosion destruction due to the formation of a continuous and dense alpha-Al2O3 scale. In the last stage of the hot corrosion process, the hot corrosion behaviours of base alloys have important influences on behaviours of the whole systems.

   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB In order to obtain more knowledge to replace or lower the content of expensive and heavy elements Re and Ru in advanced Ni-based single crystal superalloys, the role of Ru playing in the microstructure and creep performance at 1100 degrees C and 140 MPa was evaluated in this study by considering its individual effect and also synergizing it with Mo to maximize the beneficial effect from each element. A series of single crystal superalloys with varying alloying elements were investigated and their initial microstructure and microstructural evolution during the creep deformation were characterized. It was shown that both Mo and Ru could increase the gamma/gamma' lattice misfit and density of interfacial dislocations, that contributed to improve the creep resistance at high temperature and low stress condition. The inferior microstructural stability regarding to the TCP phase formation in alloys with more Mo addition lowered creep performance to some extent, however, that could be restrained by the addition of Ru. The high temperature and low stress creep performance could be enhanced by the co-addition of Mo and Ru since their synergistic effect could be able to enhance the gamma/gamma' interfacial strengthening and retain the microstructural stability.

SO RARE METAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING
AB Mechanical properties and structure stability have been investigated on new Ni-Cr-Co base superalloys after long-term aging at 700degreesC by microstructure analysis and high temperature property measurement. Long time aging at 700degreesC, results in the precipitation of the carbides MC, M23C6 as well as gamma ' (gamma prime). The carbides MC and M23C6 remain stable up to 5 008 h aging. The gamma prime grows obviously and coarsenis by diffusion-controlled growth. After long time aging at 700degreesC the hardnees (measured at room temperature) does not change much initially and then decreases with further aging in resonse to changes in the size, morphology and distribution of gamma prime. The high temperature tensile strength and the stress rupture for the tested alloy were considerably higher than Nimonic 263. In brief, the new alloys maintain a stable structure at 700degreesC and exhibit improved high-temperature properties.

SO INTERMETALLICS
AB Mechanical properties of Ni-based superalloys strongly depend on phase and site preferences of alloying elements which influence bonding strength within gamma'-Ni3Al precipitates and microstructural characteristics of these unique class of materials. In the current work, therefore, besides disclosure of the phase partitioning behaviours of alloying X elements (i.e. X = Co, Cr, Nb, Ta or Ti) among gamma' and gamma phases, their site occupancy tendencies in gamma' precipitates (determined via first-principles ab initio calculations at 0 K) and effects on the microstructural evolution of Ni80Al15X5 alloy systems (exposed to aging at 800 degrees C for 4, 16, 64 and 256 h, respectively) have been examined. Bonding features of Ni-Al, Ni-X and Al-X atomic pairs within Ni3Al-X intermetallics have been simulated by utilizing charge density difference (CDD) method, which reveals site preferences of alloying X elements as well. Present theoretical and experimental investigations have shown that mechanical strength of Nibased superalloys is predominantly affected by bonding properties within precipitates. As atomic radii of alloying X elements become closer to that of Al atom, energy change parameter, E-Ni -> Al(X) values decrease and more Al sublattice sites are preferentially occupied in gamma' precipitates. Correspondingly, bonding strength of Ni-X atomic pairs along < 110 > directions of Ni3Al-X phases and micro-hardness properties of both as-cast and pre aged Ni80Al15X5 alloy systems enhance in the order of X = Co < Cr < Ti < Nb < Ta additions. Nevertheless, with increasing aging time, mechanical strength of alloys weakens in parallel with increasing size of gamma' precipitates simultaneously evolved from near-spherical to irregular forms.

TI Oxidation of a chromia-forming nickel base alloy at high temperature in
   mixed diluted CO/H2O atmospheres
SO CORROSION SCIENCE
AB Corrosion of a chromia-forming nickel base alloy, Haynes 230 (R), has been investigated under impure helium containing a few Pa of CO and H2O at 900 degrees C. It has been found that this alloy reacts simultaneously with CO and H2O. Oxidation by CO has been revealed to occur mainly in the first hours. CO diffuses through the scale via short-circuit pathways and oxidizes Al, Cr and Si at the oxide/metal interface. Kinetics of CO oxidation has been investigated and several rate limiting steps are proposed. In the long term, H2O is the major oxidant of chromia-forming nickel base alloys in impure helium.

AB The influence of gamma precipitates on the deformation behavior of gamma' Ni3Al nanocubes with {100} side surfaces is investigated by molecular dynamics simulations of uniaxial compression tests at 300 K. The plastic deformation of the nanocubes is caused by the nucleation of Shockley partial dislocations near the cube corners followed by the formation of pseudo-twins. While the dominant deformation mechanisms and the flow stress are not affected by the presence of precipitates, the precipitates reduce the yield stress by up to 10 pct and determine the location of dislocation nucleation. These findings can be rationalized by accounting for the misfit stresses caused by the presence of the gamma precipitates. Within the simulated ranges, the results are independent of cube size, rounding of the cube or precipitate corners, surface roughness, and strain rate. The observed precipitate softening in the dislocation-nucleation-controlled deformation of gamma' NiAl nanocubes is in stark contrast to the strengthening effect caused by the presence of a gamma phase in the gamma' precipitates in the microstructure of typical Ni- and Co-based superalloys.

TI Fatigue crack growth mechanisms in superalloys: overview
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Fatigue studies on disc and blade nickel based superalloys by the author and co-workers are reviewed. Crack initiation in single crystal turbine blade alloys is dominated by interdendritic porosity with oxidation processes affecting initiation position. Lifetime trends can be modelled using a multipart Paris type lifing approach. Orientation, loading state, temperature and environment determine stage I/II crack growth mechanisms and the resulting crack path and should be considered in lifing. Mechanistic insights on how complex stress states, subsurface failures and different temperatures/environments affect fatigue processes can thus improve turbine blade lifing, and direct alloy development programmes. In polycrystalline disc alloys cracks at high temperature may initiate at oxidised subsurface carbides or porosity. Grain size controls cycle and time dependent crack growth: the benefits of increased grain size in resisting grain boundary attack mechanisms predominate over those of gamma' distribution variation. Optimising grain boundary character and distribution should yield the best alloy design strategy for high temperature fatigue performance in turbine discs.

AB Blades and vanes made from Ni - and Co - base superalloys that are used in the hot section of all gas turbine engines are coated to enhance resistance to hot corrosion. The most widely used coatings are those based on the intermetallic compounds NiAl and CoAl, which are formed by diffusion interaction of aluminium with surfaces of the nickel and cobalt alloys, respectively. Simple aluminide coatings resist high - temperature oxidation by the formation of protective layer of alumina and can be used up to about 1 150 degrees C. The coatings degrade by loss of aluminium due to spalling of oxides under thermal cycling conditions. HPT blades of DV - 2 jet engines are made from Ni - based superalloy ZS6K. For improving alloy's high temperature resistance are blades coated with Al - Si diffusion layer. Depending on jet engine flying regime an overcrossing of working temperature may occur. It may result into coarsening of the gamma prime particles, thus decreasing its strengthening effect. A real case study of DV-2 jet engine turbine blades after high temperature exposition is discussed in this article. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Kink structures induced in nickel-based single crystal superalloys by
   high-Z element migration
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Here, we investigate a new type of kink structure that is found at gamma/gamma' interfaces in nickel-based single crystal superalloys. We studied these structures at the atomic and elemental level using aberration corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM). The core of the dislocation absorbs high-Z elements (i.e., Co and Re) that adopt hexagonal arrangements, and it extrudes elements (i.e., Ni and Al) that adopt face centered cubic (fcc) structures. High-Z elements (i.e., Ta and W) and Cr, which is a low-Z element, are stabilized in body centered cubic (bcc) arrangements; Cr tends to behave like Re. High-Z elements, which migrate and adopt a hexagonal structure, induce kink formation at gamma/gamma' interfaces. This process must be analyzed to fully understand the kinetics and dynamics of creep in nickel-based single crystal superalloys. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Effects of Withdrawal Rate on the Microstructure of Directionally
   Solidified GH4720Li Superalloys
SO MATERIALS
AB Increasing the ingot size of GH4720Li superalloys makes it difficult to control their microstructure, and the withdrawal rate is an important factor in controlling and refining the microstructure of GH4720Li superalloys. In this study, GH4720Li superalloy samples were prepared via Bridgman-type directional solidification with different withdrawal rates. The morphology and average size of the dendrites in the stable growth zone during directional solidification in each sample, morphology and average size of the ' phases, and microsegregation of each alloying element were analyzed using optical microscopy, Photoshop, Image Pro Plus, field emission scanning electron microscopy, and electron probe microanalysis. Increasing the withdrawal rate significantly helped in refining the superalloy microstructure; the average secondary dendrite arm spacing decreased from 133 to 79 mu m, whereas the average sizes of the ' phases in the dendrite arms and the interdendritic regions decreased from 1.02 and 2.15 mu m to 0.69 and 1.26 mu m, respectively. Moreover, the ' phase distribution became more uniform. The microsegregation of Al, Ti, Cr, and Co decreased with the increase in the withdrawal rate; the segregation coefficients of Al, Cr, and Co approached 1 at higher withdrawal rates, whereas that of Ti remained above 2.2 at all the withdrawal rates.

TI High-temperature oxidation behaviour of novel Co-Al-W-Ta-B-(Mo, Hf, Nb)
   alloys with a coherent gamma/gamma '-dominant microstructure
SO PROGRESS IN NATURAL SCIENCE-MATERIALS INTERNATIONAL
AB In this work, 2 at% Mo, 2 at% Nb and 2 at% Hf were substituted for the same amount of W into a Co-9Al-9W-2Ta-0.02B alloy (hereafter referred as to 2Mo, 2Nb and 2Hf alloys, respectively, while the original alloy is denoted as 0Me alloy). The effect of the Mo, Hf and Nb additions on the isothermal oxidation resistance, oxide scale evolution and failure mechanism, of the Co-9Al-9W-2Ta-0.02B alloy when exposed at 800 degrees C and 900 degrees C for 100 h was investigated. It was found the Mo, Hf and Nb additions degraded the oxidation resistance of the Co-9Al-9W-2Ta-0.02B alloy, while the 2Mo alloy always displayed the poorest oxidation resistance, resulted from heavy spallation of the oxide scale. An oxide scale composed of an outer Co3O4+CoO layer, a middle complex oxide layer enriched with Al, W and Ta, and gamma/needle-like Co3W zone adhering to the gamma/gamma' substrate was gradually formed; moreover, a continuous or discontinuous Al2O3 layer and dispersive Al2O3 dots or slices were observed within the gamma/needle-like Co3W zone, depending on the oxidation temperature and added elements (Mo, Hf and Nb). The formation of volatile MoO3 in the oxide scale of the 2Mo alloy enhance the exfoliation of the oxide products, resulting in severe spallation and poor oxidation resistance.

TI Microstructure and oxidation behavior of Al plus Cr co-deposited
   coatings on nickel-based superalloys
SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB The microstructure and oxidation behavior were investigated in Al and Cr co-deposited diffusion coatings prepared by the pack cementation process. The composition (in wt.%) of the packs was 3NH(4)Cl-xAl-(25-x)Cr-72Al(2)O(3) with different Al levels (x = 0.5,1,2,4, and 10). After the heat-treatment process, the corresponding microstructure of the coatings was Cr + Cr2Ni3 + Al-rich phase, Cr + Cr2Ni3, Cr + NiAl + Ni3Al and NiAl + AlCr2, respectively. The isothermal oxidation tests were performed at 950 degrees C for up to 100 h in air, and the oxidation kinetic curves were obtained. It indicated that the coatings formed in the packs containing 1.2 wt.% Al had the lowest weight gain, while the weight gain of the coating formed in the packs having 4 wt.% Al was the largest. The presence of Cr in Al and Cr co-deposited coatings promotes Al2O3 generation. The formation mechanisms of Al + Cr co-deposited coatings and the effect of Cr in different types of coatings during the oxidation process were discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Effect of initial gamma/gamma ' microstructure on creep of single
   crystal nickel-based superalloys: A phase-field simulation incorporating
   dislocation dynamics
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB The initial gamma/gamma' microstructure (e.g. gamma' shape, size, volume fraction) may dramatically affect creep behaviour of single crystal Nickel-based superalloys. However, it is difficult to have accurate control on each of these initial aspects and to understand the role of each by experimental methods. In the present work, a novel coupled model of phase-field and continuum dislocation dynamics is developed for the co-evolution of gamma/gamma' and dislocation microstructures, such that the creep deformation of single crystal Nickel-based superalloys can be described in a physical way. The creep curve can be directly obtained by averaging dislocation activity, without any phenomenological effort that is needed for traditional constitutive models. With the coupled model, we study the effect of initial gamma/gamma' microstructure on creep of single crystal Nickel-based superalloys. The role of initial gamma' shape is studied by comparing simulations with different initial gamma' shapes but with the same gamma' size and volume fraction. The role of initial gamma' size and volume fraction are studied in the same methodology. Simulation results show that as the gamma/gamma' misfit magnitude increases, the gamma' shape transits from circular to cubic and the dislocation microstructure symmetry shifts. The cubic gamma' shape corresponding to gamma/gamma' misfit of -0.003 is the most beneficial for creep resistance, compare with gamma/gamma' misfit of -0.0015 and 0. Bigger gamma' size and higher gamma' volume fraction also result in better creep resistance, especially the benefit of high gamma' volume fraction to creep resistance is dramatic. The simulation results may bring inspirations for design of new single crystal Nickel-based superalloys with excellent creep resistance. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB To understand how to tailor microstructure of high-Co polycrystalline superalloys during hot processing, the flow curves of a nickel-based superalloy with high Co content was quantitatively analyzed, and the microstructure evolution was studied by a high-throughput method. The results suggested that hot working conditions, especially the temperature, strongly influenced the grain structure at annealing. In specific, deforming under low strain rate and high temperature conditions facilitated the recovery and grain growth to consume the stored strain energy, furthermore, the weakened pinning effects of gamma' precipitates accelerated these procedures, which made the high-Co superalloy more vulnerable to the formation of abnormally large grains during subsequent supersolvus annealing.

AB Superalloys are extensively used at high temperature applications due to their good oxidation and corrosion resistance properties in addition to their high stability were made at high temperature. Experimental measurements of hot corrosion at high temperature of Inconel 617 and Inconel 738 superalloys. The experiments were carried out at temperatures 700 degrees C, 800 degrees C and 900 degrees C for different exposure times to up to 100 h. The corrosive media was NaCl and Na2SO4 sprayed on the specimens. Seven different specimens were used at each temperature. The corrosion process is endothermic and the spontaneity increased by increasing temperature. The activation energy was found to be Ea = 23.54 and E-a = 25.18 Kj/mol for Inconel 738 and Inconel 617 respectively. X-ray diffraction technique (XRD) was used to analyze the formed scale. The morphology of the specimen and scale were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results show that the major corrosion products formed were NiCr2O4, and Co Cr2O4 spinles, in addition to Cr2O3. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB For the fcc phase of the Ni-Al-Co-Cr-Hf-Mo-Re-Ta-Ti-W system, diffusion data in various constituent binary systems were assessed to establish a multicomponent diffusion mobility database. The diffusion assessment relied on an existing thermodynamic database for the calculation of needed thermodynamic factors. The mobilities determined for the self-diffusion of the components in the fcc phase (a metastable state for some components) were consistent with the correlation of the diffusivity with the melting point. The general agreement of calculated and measured diffusion coefficients in the Ni-Co-Cr-Mo and Ni-Al-Cr-Mo quaternary systems demonstrated the ability of the database to extrapolate to higher order systems. Finally, the mobility database, in conjunction with an available thermodynamic database and a finite-difference diffusion code. was used to simulate a multicomponent diffusion couple between two commercial Ni-base superalloys.

TI Properties of newly developed Co-based brazing fillers
SO WELDING IN THE WORLD
AB Co-based materials are widely used in high temperature applications like aircraft industry, industrial furnaces, or gas turbine manufacturing. The main requirements on the Co superalloys are high temperature and corrosion resistance. To produce complex structures, it is necessary to join these alloys. In this work, Co-based brazing fillers for high temperature service conditions are developed. The influence of different alloying elements on the melting behavior as well as on the microstructure is investigated. A melting temperature below 1200 degrees C is achieved via addition of Ti to the near eutectic alloy CoZrTaC9, developed in previous studies. Brazing tests are carried out on the Co-based superalloy Mar M 509 using induction heating. The mechanical properties are determined by tensile tests at room temperature and at an elevated temperature of 850 degrees C. The fracture morphology of the tensile samples is investigated by light microscopy as well as SEM.

AB Interatomic potentials for pure Co and the Co-Al binary system have been developed based on the second nearest-neighbor modified embedded-atom method (2NN MEAM) potential formalism. The potentials can describe various fundamental physical properties of the relevant materials in good agreement with experimental information. The potential is utilized to an atomistic computation of interfacial properties between fcc-Co (gamma) and Co3Al (gamma') phases. It is found that the anisotropy in the gamma/gamma' interfacial energy is relatively small and leaves a room for further modification by alloying other elements. The applicability of the atomistic approach to an elaborate alloy design of advanced Co-based superalloys through the investigation of the effect of alloying elements on interfacial and elastic properties is discussed.

TI Diffusion of Germanium in Binary and Multicomponent Nickel Alloys
SO JOURNAL OF PHASE EQUILIBRIA AND DIFFUSION
AB Interdiffusion and impurity diffusion of Ge is studied in Ni and multicomponent alloys over the temperature range of 1150-1250 degrees C. The diffusion is investigated using diffusion couples, which are evaluated using microprobe measurements. The interdiffusion coefficients are calculated with the den Broeder method, while the impurity diffusion coefficients are determined with the Hall method. A model for the diffusion simulation software DICTRA is developed by mobility assessments. Further on, the diffusion of Ge in the multicomponent superalloys PWA1483 and Rene N5 is investigated. The Ge diffusion coefficient in Rene N5 is 4.5x10(-14) m(2)/s at 1180 degrees C which is similar to other alloying elements such as Co, Cr, Mo or Ta.

SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB The effects of Co and Ti additions on the microstructures and compressive strength of the Ni-based superalloy Udiemt710 (U710) were investigated. The preliminary results showed that the Ni(3)Ti-type (eta) phase was observed in the alloys with low Co and Ti content; while a (Ni(x)Co(1-x))(3)Ti phase with a hexagonal structure was detected in the alloys with high Co and Ti content. The gamma ' ->eta ->( Ni(x)Co(1-0))(3)Ti phase transformation was discussed in terms of Co and Ti contents. The gamma ' morphology changed from spherical to cuboidal with increasing Co and Ti content. Compressive tests showed that the alloys with Co and Ti addition possessed higher yield strength than the base alloy, U710. The strength increase could be ascribed to solid-solution strengthening of the gamma and gamma ' phases as a result of the Co and Ti additions, and the higher volume fraction of gamma ' in the new alloys.

SO TRANSACTIONS OF NONFERROUS METALS SOCIETY OF CHINA
AB The Co-Cr-W ternary system was critically assessed using the CALPHAD technique. The solution phases including the liquid, gamma-Co, epsilon-Co and alpha-Cr were described by a substitutional solution model. The sigma, mu and R phases were described by three-sublattice models of (Co,W)(8)(Cr,W)(4)(Co,Cr,W)(18), (Co,Cr,W)(7)W(2)(Co,Cr,W)(4) and (Co,W)(27)(Cr,W)(14)(Co,Cr,W)(12), respectively, in order to reproduce their homogeneity ranges. A self-consistent set of thermodynamic parameters for each phase was derived. The calculated isothermal sections at 1 000, 1 200 and 1 350 degrees C are in good agreement with the experimental data. A eutectoid reaction of R double left right arrow mu+gamma-Co+sigma in this ternary system was predicted to occur at 1 022 degrees C.

TI Prediction of creep rupture life in nickel-base superalloys using
   Bayesian neural network
SO JOURNAL OF THE JAPAN INSTITUTE OF METALS
AB The creep rupture life of nickel-base superalloys has been predicted using a neural network model within a Bayesian framework. The rupture life was modelled as a function of some 42 variables, including temperature, chemical composition: Cr, Co, C, Si, Mn, P, S, Mo, Cu, Ti, Al, B, N, Nb, Ta, Zr, Fe, W, V, Hf, Re, Mg, ThO2, La, four steps of heat treatment (each has its own temperature, duration and cooling rate), sample shape, solidification method, yield strength, ultimate tensile strength and elongation. The Bayesian method puts error bars on the predicted value of the rupture life and allows the significance of each individual factor to be estimated. The scale of the error bars changes with the accuracy of the prediction: it is large when the prediction is uncertain, indicating that the whole prediction system is reliable.

SO CALPHAD-COMPUTER COUPLING OF PHASE DIAGRAMS AND THERMOCHEMISTRY
AB Diffusion couples for fcc Cu-Fe-Co ternary system are prepared, all of which are annealed at 1573 K for 50 h. Interdiffusion coefficients are evaluated at the intersection points of two independent diffusion paths sharing a common composition. Such main and cross interdiffusion coefficients are then used to inversely retrieve atomic mobilities of Cu, Fe and Co in fcc Cu-Fe-Co alloys, with the aid of available thermodynamic description. Further validation concerning the quality of atomic mobilities is conducted with computational simulations for diffusion couples, the results of which are compared with experimental data.

CT Seminar on the Modelling of Atomic and Microstructures in Metals and

CY NOV, 1994
CL JAPAN
AB The Monte Carlo method was applied to the simulation of temporal evolutions of atomic arrangement in Ni-base superalloys. The ordering kinetics was controlled by direct exchange of a randomly selected single atom with one of its neighbouring atoms. The formation of gamma' phase gamma'/gamma equilibrium and substitutional behaviours of alloying elements were predicted by the model. The reductions of total energy normalized by initial energy by ordering are about 3%, for superalloys CMSX-4 and about 2% for TMS63. The formation and coarsening rates of gamma' phase in CMSX-4 are higher than those in TMS63. The size distribution profiles for CMSX-4 and TMS63 approach time-invariant profiles. The variations of calculated phase composition of gamma' and gamma phases of CMSX-4 and TMS63 with time are not significant. The enrichment of Al, Ti and Ta in gamma' phase and Co and gamma phase is observed. Cr is partitioning into both gamma' and gamma phases. This qualitatively agrees with the phase analysis of Ni-Al-Ti ternary alloys by cluster variation method. The variations of calculated concentration of alloying element in Ni and Al sublattices of gamma' phase in CMSX-4 and TMS63 with lime are not significant. The preferential substitutions of Ti, Mo and Ta in Al sublattice and Co in Ni sublattice are predicted. Cr is entering into both Ni and Al sublattices. The tendency of site occupation predicted by the simulation is consistent with the classification given by Enomoto and Harada. The Monte Carlo simulation results on site occupancies of alloying elements of CMSX-4 and TMS63 are in good agreement with those observed by atom probe FIM analysis and then calculated by the cluster variation method except for Ni concentration in the Al sublattice.

TI Phase evolution and crystallography of precipitates during decomposition
   of new "tungsten-free" Co(Ni)-Mo-Al-Nb gamma-gamma ' superalloys at
   elevated temperatures
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB This article reports the microstructural stability and consequent phase decomposition including the appearance of topologically close-packed (TCP) phases at high temperature of recently discovered tungsten-free gamma-gamma' alloys of base composition Co-10Al-5Mo-2Nb with or without the addition of Ni and Ti. On prolonged aging at 800 degrees C of the Co-10Al-5Mo-2Nb alloy, needle-shaped DO19-ordered precipitates with stoichiometry of Co-3(Mo, Nb) start appearing in the microstructure. In addition, growth of cellular domains from the grain boundaries featuring a three-phase composite lamellar structure could be observed. These phases are fcc gamma-Co with composition different from the original matrix, CoAl with B2 ordering and Co-3(Mo, Nb) with DO19 ordering. All the phases exhibit well-defined crystallographic orientation relationships. The decomposition of the alloys depends on the solvus temperature of the gamma' phase. The Ni-containing alloy exhibits no phase decomposition until 100 h of aging at 800 degrees C without any significant effect on gamma' volume fraction (76 %). However, at 950 degrees C, the alloy decomposes leading to the appearance of four different phases including TCP phases: a Cr3Si-type cubic phase, a hexagonal Laves phase, rhombohedral mu phase, and solid solution of Co phase. The gamma-gamma' microstructure in the Co-10Al-5Mo-2Nb and Co-30Ni-10Al-5Mo-2Ta alloys is not stable at 800 and 950 degrees C, respectively, on long-term aging. This shows that the measured solvus temperatures (i.e., 866 and 990 degrees C) are metastable solvus temperatures. We also report that the Ti-containing alloy exhibits superior stability with no evidence of either TCP phase formation or any other decomposition of gamma' precipitates, even after aging at 950 degrees C for 100 h.

   oxidation behaviour of Co-Re-Cr-based alloys
SO CORROSION SCIENCE
AB The effect of Ni on the oxidation behaviour of the alloy Co-17Re-23Cr (at.%) is studied. The results show that the alloying of 15 at.% Ni improves the alloy oxidation resistance significantly by promoting the formation of a protective Cr2O3 layer. This effect can be attributed at least partially to the enhancement of Cr diffusion by Ni in the metallic Co-Re-Cr-Ni matrix. Moreover, the formation of relatively slow growing Co(Ni)O solid-solution in the transient stage supports the lateral growth of Cr2O3 nuclei and thus accelerates the establishment of the compact chromia layer.

TI Effect of High Magnetic Field on the Microstructure in Directionally
   Solidified Co-Al-W Alloy
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB Recently, a new Co-Al-W-based alloy with ordered L12 structure has been attracted much attention of researchers, these alloys have higher melting point than Ni-base superalloys with morphologically identical microstructure, but grain defect formation caused by thermosolutal convection has become an important problem for its application. Magnetic field is always applied to damp the convection which reduces the formation of defects. However, there are hitherto few papers to investigate the effect of magnetic field on grain defects during Co-Al-W- based alloy directional solidification. In this work, The effect of high magnetic field on the solidification structure and macrosegregation in directionally solidified Co-Al-Wbased alloy was investigated. The results showed that the application of longitudinal magnetic field can induce convection and cause deformation of the solid-liquid interface shape, forming the macrosegregation and the stray grains in the mushy zone at the pulling rate of 5 mu m/s. With the increase of pulling rate, the macrosegregation and the stray grains disappeared gradually at 2 T magnetic field. While the transverse magnetic field was applied, the macrosegregation became serious and the number of the stray grains increased. The macrosegregation further became more serious and the columnar-to-equiaxed transition was induced after adding the Ta element. The main reason of undercooling nucleation and columnar-toequiaxed transition (CET) was the microsegregation induced by thermoelectric magnetic convention.

SO JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS
AB The present paper describes the corrosion behavior of recently developed Ni-base superalloys: an oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) alloy, two kinds of Ni-Cr-W alloys and Hastelloy XR at 1373 K in a simulated HTGR impure helium gas. Corrosion tests were carried out using a transparent quartz retort at 1373 K for up to 3.6 Ms in circulating helium gas which contained a small amount of H-2, CH4, CO, CO2 and H2O. The mass change versus exposure time relation revealed that the ODS alloy exhibited excellent oxidation resistance. One Ni-Cr-W alloy (113MA) and Hastelloy XR showed exfoliation of the oxide films after the tests. All the alloys were decarburized from the early exposure times. These results are discussed on the basis of phase stability diagrams for constituent elements in the alloys.

TI Microstructure and mechanical behavior at elevated temperatures of a
   novel nickel base superalloy heavily alloyed with forming and
   substitution elements
SO LETTERS ON MATERIALS
AB A novel nickel base superalloy heavily alloyed with gamma' forming and substitution elements, particularly with rhenium and tungsten, has been proposed in the present work as a potential die material for die forging of the most hard-to-deform nickel base superalloys. The superalloy composition is Ni-13(Al, Ti, Nb, Ta)-27(Cr, Co, Mo, W, Re, Si, C, B) (wt.%). The superalloy ingot was manufactured by vacuum induction melting. Microstructure examination showed that the as-cast condition was characterized by a coarse grained dendritic structure consisted of coarse gamma grains containing gamma' precipitates with a size 0.3 -1 mu m and primary gamma' particles with a size 5 -100 mu m. A small amount of carbides and topologically close packed (TCP) phases was also detected. The microstructure examination suggests that the general solidification pathway was L ->gamma ->gamma', as it is in nickel base superalloys. At the same time, the primary gamma' particles were probably formed via the peritectic reaction L-noneq + gamma ->gamma', where L-noneq is the nonequilibrium liquid, which was retained at the peritectic temperature. The superalloy was subjected to heat treatment including solid solution treatment and ageing. The heat treatment led to coagulation of the primary gamma' phase and to a slight decrease in the volume fractions of carbides and TCP phases. The heat treated condition was used to prepare samples for compression tests, which were performed at 900-1200 degrees C up to the true strain e= 0.1. The yield strength of the novel superalloy was generally appreciably higher as compared with those of known nickel base superalloys and alloys based on the Ni3Al intermetallic phase.

AB With the advent of powerful mathematical modeling techniques for material phenomena, there is renewed interest in reliable data for the density of the Ni-based superalloys. Up to now, there has been few report on the density of molten Ni-Co alloy. In order to obtain more accurate density data for molten Ni-Co alloy, the density of molten Ni-Co alloy was measured with a modified sessile drop method, and the accommodation of different atoms in molten Ni-Co alloy was analyzed. The density of alloy is found to decrease with increasing temperature and Co concentration in the alloy. The molar volume of molten Ni-Co alloy increases with increasing Co concentration. The molar volume of Ni-Co alloy determined shows a positive deviation from the linear molar volume, and the deviation of molar volume from ideal mixing increases with increasing Co concentration over the experimental concentration range.

SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB Aluminide coatings are prepared on a new Co-base superalloy DZ40M by low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LP-CVD), and their cyclic oxidation behavior is investigated. The results show that the coating degradation primarily results from Al-depleting to heal the oxide scale on the outer surface during the cyclic oxidation, unlike that primarily from inward Al diffusion to the substrate during the isothermal process. The effect of Ti on the oxidation resistance is very different for various intermetallic alloys, and the addition of Ti will increase the degradation for the present coating during high-temperature oxidation. These experimental results are helpful to clarify the understanding of the Ti-modification effect on aluminide coatings for Co-based superalloys. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

SO METALS AND MATERIALS INTERNATIONAL
AB The oxidation behavior of Ni-based superalloys was examined by cyclic oxidation tests at 850 and 1000 degrees C. The present study focused on the investigation of two newly developed and three commercial alloys (GTD-111, IN738LC, and CM247LC). The oxidation resistance of the superalloys were evaluated by the oxidation rate constants and the mass gains. The oxidation scales mainly consisted of outer Cr2O3 and inner Al2O3 layers at both temperatures, as well as oxides of minor elements such as TiO2, NiCr2O4, CrTaO4, HfO2, and TaO. The oxidation resistance of the alloys containing larger amounts of Al, W, and Ta and lower Mo and Ti concentrations was higher than those of the other alloys. The ranking of oxidation resistance for the alloys corresponded to the statistical prediction drawn from a response surface analysis. Furthermore, these alloys contained more Ta oxides, such as CrTaO4 and TaO, suggesting that Ta oxides had an active role in improving the oxidation resistance.

AB The phases formed at the interface between an intermetallic (NiAl) and a nickel base superalloy joined by combustion synthesis were investigated, particularly the eutectic phases. Owing to their small size, the characterisation of these phases using a Castaing's electron microprobe encounters difficulties. The analysis volume size is generally too large to differentiate the phases from their surrounding matrix, even by using low accelerating voltage. Moreover, the eutectic phases contain boron, which is difficult to characterise by EPMA. Independently of the phases shape, the characterisation can be solved by viewing this complex system as a surrounding matrix and a multi layer system. The results of these simulations revealed the presence of two categories of borides: the eutectic boride MM'B-2(2) (M = Mo and M' = Co, Cr) and the solid solution boride [Cr1-x (Mo, W)(x)]B.

The results showed that Ti and Al were mainly enriched in the gamma' phase, partially partitioned in the gamma matrix, and slightly distributed in the carbides. Different Ti and Al contents in various alloys influenced the composition and amount of MC carbides but did not influence the MC carbides' morphology. With increasing Ti and Al contents, gamma + gamma' fan-type structures formed at the grain boundary, eventually resulting in a coarsened gamma' phase. In addition, the morphology of the secondary gamma' phase transformed from nearly spherical to cuboidal. The saturation degrees of Cr, Co, and Mo in the gamma matrix were substantially improved with increasing Ti and Al contents.

TI Synthesis of Hf-modified aluminide coatings on Co-base superalloys
SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB Hf-modified and Hf-Pt-modified aluminide coatings on Haynes 188 Co-base alloy coupons were developed and furthermore, Hf-modified aluminide coatings on MAR-M-509 Co-base aircraft turbine engine vane segments were produced for potential industrial applications. Surface morphology and cross-section microstructure of the developed coatings were inspected and compared by using Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), and Glow-Discharge Mass Spectrometry (GDMS). Experimental results showed that Hf was successfully incorporated and localized Hf-rich precipitated phase particles were observed on the coating surface and within the coating additive layer. The Hf-rich particles and the effect of heat treatment on the particles are also discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Evolution of Microstructures and Properties of a New gamma/gamma '
   Co-Based Superalloy via Forging Process
SO JOM
AB A new gamma/gamma ' Co-based superalloy has been developed with a large temperature range between the gamma ' solvus and solidus temperature, which can be formed through the conventional casting and wrought processing route. The microstructure, mechanical and corrosion resistance properties of this new gamma/gamma ' Co-based superalloy are characterized in the present study. The results show that even in the forged state, the partial recrystallization and grain growth processes occur, but the gamma ' precipitates remain very fine. Forging and aging increase the mechanical strength and facilitate the formation of stable passive films due to decreased low-angle boundaries and increased sigma 3 twin boundaries. The twin boundaries are beneficial for improving both the mechanical properties and corrosion resistance, which provides guidance for tailoring the microstructure and properties of novel Co-based superalloys.

TI CORRELATION OF TA/W-COMPOSITIONAL RATIOS WITH THE HIGH-TEMPERATURE
   PROPERTIES OF NI-CR-AL-TA-W(-CO) SINGLE-CRYSTAL SUPERALLOYS
SO TETSU TO HAGANE-JOURNAL OF THE IRON AND STEEL INSTITUTE OF JAPAN
AB The optimum Ta/W compositional ratio was searched for in Ni-10/11 mol% Cr-12/14 mol% Al-Ta-W(-5 mol% Co) alloys in order to get an excellent combination of creep-rupture, phase stability and hot-corrosion resistance in a Na2SO4-NaCl salt.  Solidification and precipitation temperatures were also examined as a function of the Ta/W ratio.  The gamma' solvus temperature and the creep-rupture life were found to increase with increasing Ta/W ratio up to 1.0.  However, when the ratio exceeded 1.0, the creep-rupture life reversely decreased probably due to the increase in the residual amount of the eutectic gamma' phase in alloys.  On the other hand, hot-corrosion resistance increased monotonously with the Ta/W ratio.  From the present study it was concluded that the Ta/W compositional ratio of 0.5 to 1.0 was most suitable for balancing the high temperature properties in this alloy system.

AB The useful operating life of superalloy components operating in gas turbines is dependent to a large extent on the ability of applied surface coatings to resist corrosive degradation. Coatings have been fine-tuned over many years of use to give satisfactory performance in airborne applications, but the recent adoption of I:as turbines in the utility sector has placed renewed demand on the need to evaluate and develop existing and new coating systems. This paper describes the behaviour of a series of vacuum plasma sprayed MCrAlY(Si) and Al/Si coatings applied to the Ni-base IN738 and UD520 and Co-base FSX-414 and X45 superalloys. Test specimens have been exposed to both simple argon-O-2-SO2 gas mixtures and to simulated combustion gas mixtures in a low-velocity burner rig for times up to 1000 hours in the temperature range 800 to 1000 degrees C, The results obtained in the form of microstructural changes suggest an upper temperature limit below 900 degrees C for the application of high Al anti Si-containing coatings due to interdiffusion with the base alloy and a strong influence of combustion gas composition on corrosion rate.

TI Effect of superficially applied ZrO2 inhibitor on the high temperature
   corrosion performance of some Fe-, Co- and Ni-base superalloys
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB High temperature corrosion is an acute form of corrosion occurring at elevated temperature in the presence of an oxidizing gas and is associated with a thin electrolytic deposit (salt or ash) on alloy. Inhibitors and fuel additives have been used with varying success to combat oil ash corrosion. In this paper, the effect of an oxide additive namely ZrO2 on the hot corrosion behaviour of some superalloys, viz. Superfer 800H (alloy A), Superco 605 (alloy B) and Superni 75 (alloy C) has been investigated in an Na2SO4-60% V2O5 environment at 900 degrees C for 50 cycles. Each cycle consisted of 1 h heating in a Silicon Carbide Tube furnace followed by 20 min cooling in ambient air. Weight change measurements after each cycle were taken by an electronic balance having an accuracy of 0.01 mg. XRD, SEM and EPMA analyses of the exposed specimens were carried out to characterize the oxide scales. In the Na2SO4-60% V2O5 environment, the corrosion rate for the Co-base alloy was found to be highest, whereas that for the Ni-base Superni 75 a lowest. Whereas, with ZrO2 superficial coating, the overall weight gains got reduced for the alloys B and C, however the inhibitor was marginally effective in the alloy A. A thick scale was observed in the latter case, which was rich in Cr, Ni, Fe and V. Absence of protective continuous chromia layer and presence of less protective NiO was probably the main reason for more corrosion rate in this case. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

SO SCRIPTA MATERIALIA
AB The compression deformation behavior of single-crystal micropillars of L1(2)-Co-3(Al,W) has been investigated at room temperature as a function of pillar size and crystal orientation. The critical resolved shear stress (CRSS) obeys an inverse power-law scaling against pillar size and is independent of orientation. With the bulk CRSS value of Co-3(Al,W) at room temperature estimated by extrapolating the size dependence of CRSS for micropillars, comparison of high-temperature strength is made on the CRSS values for Co-3(Al,W) and Ni3Al-based compounds. Co-3(Al,W) has turned out not to be strong enough to provide excellent high-temperature strength for Co-based superalloys, at least for ternary composition. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Activation Energy of Oxidation of Novel Co-Al-W Superalloys at High
   Temperatures
SO RARE METAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING
AB Co-Al-W alloy is a novel Co-base superalloy, with the precipitation strengthening phase of ternary compound gamma'-Co(3)(Al,W). The kinetic data of oxidation mass gain were measured for the Co-Al-W alloy at 800 and 900 degrees C in air, and the oxidation rate constants at different temperatures were determined by the relevant linear fitting. According to Arrhenius relation of the oxidation rate constants, the activation energy of oxidation was derived for this alloy at 800 and 900 degrees C. It is found that 9W alloy has the highest value of activation energy of oxidation among 7.5W, 9W and 10.7W at different temperatures. The addition of refractory elements Mo, Nb, Ta and Ti can change the mass gain and activation energy of oxidation of the Co-Al-W alloy; therefore, the oxidation resistance of the superalloy at high temperatures can be forecast.

AB The Al-Co-Ni system is essential to both Co-and Ni-based superalloys. In this study phase relationships among Al, L1(2) and B2 at 800 degrees C have been investigated by using equilibrated alloys. Four samples were prepared and annealed at 800 degrees C for 14 days. SEM-EDXS and XRD were used to analyze the annealed samples. The results indicated that two-phase L1(2)+ B2 and three-phase Al + L1(2)+ B2 regions exit.
   A thermodynamic reassessment of the entire Al-Co-Ni system has been made according to the CALPHAD method. Compared to the previous assessments, more recent experimental results have been considered. In the Al-Co binary system, the phase named Y-Co4Al13 has been added on the basis of the available literature. The order-disorder model has been adopted to describe the Al/L1(2) and A(2)/B-2 phase relations, respectively. Three ternary compounds in the Al-rich region have been introduced. Three-sublattice model has been selected to describe the tau phase with a considerable solubility extension. Thermodynamic interaction parameters have been optimized, considering the available experimental data. In this work several diagrams were calculated, which can fit experimental results in the whole composition range. A satisfactory agreement was obtained. As a result phase equilibria in the interested ferromagnetic shape memory alloys are calculated.

AB Long-term 1093 K heat treatments of three commercial superalloy sheet materials were undertaken in air and vacuum. With either exposure, significant precipitation of second phases occurred in the Co-base Haynes(R) Alloy 188 (HA 188) and the Ni-base Haynes(R) Alloy 230 (HA 230); however, much less precipitation was found in the exposed Ni-base alloy Inconel(R) 617 (IN 617). Although some grain growth occurred in HA 188, no changes in the grain size of either RA 230 or IN 617 were observed after 22,500 h at temperature. Oxidation during air heat treatments led to weight gain due to the formation of chromia + spinel scales and surface-connected grain boundary pits/oxides in all three superalloys. Both the weight gain and depth of intergranular attack were dependent on the square root of time, which is indicative of diffusion-controlled phenomena. Because many alloy samples had neighbors in close proximity, most vacuum heat treated specimens did not suffer significant loss of volatile elements. However, some exposed samples were subjected to unrestricted vacuum heat treatments, allowing estimates of volatilization to be made. Based on the data for HA 188, the weight loss during 1093 K vacuum exposure was diffusion controlled once the inhibiting effects of surface films on the as-received alloys were broken down.

TI Microstructural characterization of the M23C6 carbide in a long-term
   aged Ni-based superalloy
SO PHILOSOPHICAL MAGAZINE LETTERS
AB The microstructural features of M23C6 carbide in a long-term aged heat- and corrosion-resistant Ni-based superalloy have been investigated in detail using various kinds of transmission electron microscope (TEM) techniques. It is found that TEM contrast, which is related to structural and chemical inhomogeneities inside the grains, always exists in the interior of grains in the alloy. The structure of these inhomogeneous regions has been determined to be the same as that of the and t-M23C6 phases, where t-M23C6 indicates a transitional and metastable phase. Although possessing the same structure as the M23C6 phase, the chemical composition of the t-M23C6 is different from that of the M23C6 phase. Compared with M23C6, t-M23C6 is richer in Ni, Co, Al and Ti but poorer in W, Mo and Cr. This phenomenon of structural and chemical inhomogeneity demonstrates that pristine M23C6 carbide (p-M23C6) precipitated in standard heat-treated samples is unstable. Therefore, upon long-term ageing treatment, Ni, Co, Al and Ti may locally enrich inside the p-M23C6 phase, finally forming the phase, which can be described by the decomposition reaction p-M23C6M23C6+.

AB In order to obtain more accurate density for molten Ni-(Cr, Co, W) binary alloy, the densities of molten pure Ni and Ni-Cr, Ni-Co, Ni-W alloys were measured with a sessile drop method. It is found that the measured densities of molten pure Ni and Ni-Cr, Ni-Co, Ni-W alloys decrease with increasing temperature in the experimental temperature range. The density of alloys increases with increasing W and Co concentrations while it decreases with increasing Cr concentration in the alloy at 1 773-1 873 K. The molar volume of Ni-based alloys increases with increasing W concentration while it decreases with increasing Co concentration. The effect of Cr concentration on the molar volume of the alloy is little in the studied concentration range. The accommodation among atomic species was analyzed. The deviation of molar volume from ideal mixing shows an ideal mixing of Ni-(Cr, Co, W) binary alloys.

AB A multicomponent, one-dimensional diffusion model that was developed for simulating microstructure evolution in coated gas turbine blade systems has been used to compare the phase structures of three MCrAlY coated superalloy systems. The model is based on finite differences and incorporates oxidation and equilibrium thermodynamic computations. The superalloy substrates considered were the nickel-based superalloy CMSX-4, a high-Cr single-crystal superalloy, and a cobalt-based MAR-M509, and these were all coated with an MCrAlY bond coat of similar composition. The results predicted by the model have been compared with similar experimental systems. The model can predict many features observed experimentally and therefore can be expected to be a useful tool in lifetime prediction and microstructural assessment of turbine blade systems based on superalloys. The work also highlighted the fact that for a given coating, the phase evolution within system is dependent on the substrate material.

AB Recently, operating temperature of USC plants is getting higher and planned up to 700 degrees C. Austenitic superalloys are promising instead of ferritic heat resistant steels because of necessity of high strength at around 650-700 degrees C. In general, austenitic Ni base superalloys indicate higher creep rupture strength than ferritic heat resistant steels, however their thermal expansions are higher, creep rupture ductilities lower, and costs higher. Firstly, to obtain low thermal expansion we have noticed Mo containing superalloy, then investigated the effect of Mo and Co content, the amount of gamma prime phase, Al/Ti ratio in gamma prime phase on thermal expansion, tensile properties, and creep rupture properties, compared with conventional Mo containing alloy252 as a reference. As a result, a developed superalloy, although it contains no Co, combined with modified heat treatment, indicated much higher creep rupture elongation than Alloy252, keeping low thermal expansion and high creep rupture strength close to Alloy252.
   Furthermore, Creep-rupture properties at 700 degrees C up to about 20,000h were evaluated for long-term applications, and weldability and mechanical properties of weld joint at 750 degrees C were also investigated for boiler tube applications.

AB Super alloys, which can be divided into three categories, i.e. Ni-base, Co-base, and Fe-base alloys, are widely used for high temperature applications. Since superalloys contain many alloying elements and precipitates, their chemistry and processing parameters need to be carefully designed. In this study, we designed a new Ni alloy to prevent corrosion due to water vapor and gases at high temperatures. The new alloy was designed using the theoretical value of the resulting energy electronic state calculation(DV-X alpha method). The components that were finally used were Cr, Mo, and Ti, with Ni as a base. For these alloys, elements were selected in order to compare their values with that of the average theoretical basis for an Inconel 625 alloy. Finally, two kinds of Ni alloy were designed: Ni-28Cr-4Mo-2Ti and Ni-20Cr-10Mo-1Ti.

AB The atomic structure of some Ni-base single-crystal superalloys has been investigated using atom-probe field ion microscopy (APFIM) and the results compared with numerical estimations obtained from the alloy design program (ADP) and the cluster variation method (CVM). Re-containing CMSX4 and V-containing RR2000 alloys, together with TMS63 are the subjects of this study. It is found that Ti, Ta and Hf have a strong preference for the gamma' phase, whereas Cr, Co, W, Re and Mo tend to dissolve in the gamma phase. V has a very weak preference for the gamma phase. The results agree very well with both ADP and CVM. The APFIM analyses have also revealed that Re atoms in CMSX4 tend to preferentially occupy the sites normally designated for Al atoms in the gamma' phase. It is demonstrated that the site occupancy of other alloying elements such as Ta, W, Mo and Co can be estimated accurately using CVM, although there are some discrepancies for the distributions of Cr, Ti and Ni. The effect of solute atom distribution on creep properties is discussed briefly.
