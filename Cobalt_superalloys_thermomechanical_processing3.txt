AB Failure behavior of thermal barrier coated (TBC) Ni-based superalloy
   specimens were studied from the aspect of the effect of bond coat
   material behavior on low cycle fatigue (LCF) and thermo-mechanical
   fatigue (TMF) at various temperatures and under various loading
   conditions. Initially, monotonic tensile tests were carried out on a
   MCrAlY alloy bond coat material in the temperature range of 298 K to
   1273 K (25 A degrees C to 1000 A degrees C). Special attention was paid
   to understand the ductile to brittle transition temperature (DBTT).
   Next, LCF and TMF tests were carried out on the thermal barrier coated
   Ni-based alloy IN738 specimen. After these tests, the specimens were
   sectioned to understand their failure mechanisms on the basis of DBTT of
   the bond coat material. Experimental results demonstrated that the LCF
   and TMF lives of the TBC specimen were closely related to the DBTT of
   the bond coat material, and also the TMF lives were different from those
   of LCF tests. It has also been observed that the crack density in the
   bond coat in the TBC specimen was significantly dependent on the test
   conditions. More importantly, not only the number of cracks but also the
   crack penetration probability into substrate were shown to be sensitive
   to the DBTT.

AB The microstructure stability during delta sub-solvus annealing in
   Inconel 718 was investigated, focusing on the conditions that may lead
   to the development of very large grains (about 100 mu m) in a
   recrystallized fine grained matrix (4 to 5 mu m) despite the presence of
   second-phase particles. Microstructure evolution was analyzed by EBSD
   (grain size, intragranular misorientation) and SEM (delta phase
   particles). Results confirm that, in the absence of stored energy, the
   grain structure is controlled by the delta phase particles, as predicted
   by the Smith-Zener equation. If the initial microstructure is strained
   (epsilon < 0.1) before annealing, then low stored energy grains grow to
   a large extent, despite the Zener pinning forces exerted by the
   second-phase particles on the grain boundaries. Those selectively
   growing grains could be those of the initial microstructure that were
   the least deformed, or they could result from a nucleation process. The
   balance of three forces acting on boundary migration controls the growth
   process: if the sum of capillarity and stored energy driving forces
   exceeds the Zener pinning force, then selective grain growth occurs.
   Such phenomenon could be simulated, using a level set approach in a
   finite element context, by taking into account the three forces acting
   on boundary migration and by considering a realistic strain energy
   distribution (estimated from EBSD measurements).

AB The study of fatigue behaviors for nickel-base superalloys is very
   significant because fatigue damage results in serious consequences. In
   this paper, two kinds of heat treatment procedures (Pro.I and Pro.II)
   were taken to investigate the effect of heat treatment on
   microstructures and fatigue behaviors of a nickel-base superalloy.
   Fatigue behaviors were studied through total strain controlled mode at
   650 degrees C. Manson-Coffin relationship and three-parameter power
   function were used to predict fatigue life. A good link between the
   cyclic/fatigue behavior and microscopic studies was established. The
   cyclic deformation mechanism and fatigue mechanism were discussed. The
   results show that the fatigue resistance significantly drops with the
   increase of total strain amplitudes. Manson-Coffin relationship can well
   predict the fatigue life for total strain amplitude from 0.5% to 0.8%.
   The fatigue resistance is related with heat treatment procedures. The
   fatigue resistance performance of Pro.I is better than that of Pro.II.
   The cyclic stress response behaviors are closely related to the changes
   of the strain amplitudes. The peak stress of the alloy gradually
   increases with the increase of total strain amplitudes. The main
   fracture mechanism is inhomogeneous deformation and the different
   interactions between dislocations and gamma' precipitates.

AB This study focuses on deformation characteristics of superalloy IN718 by
   formulation of a new flow stress model and detailed evaluation of
   intrinsic workability through the generation of three-dimensional (3D)
   processing maps with the support of optical microstructural
   observations. Based on thermomechanical simulation tests using a
   Gleeble-1500 machine, the flow stress model for superalloy IN718 was
   built and the flow stress throughout the entire deformation process was
   described by a peak stress only depending on Zener-Hollomon parameter
   and strain. The developed model exhibited the strain softening due to
   dynamic recrystallisation (DRX). The intrinsic workability was further
   investigated by constructing 3D processing maps. The 3D processing maps
   described the variations of the efficiency of power dissipation and flow
   instability domains as a function of strain rate, temperature and
   strain, from which the favourite deformation conditions for
   thermomechanical processing of IN718 can be established. (C) 2015 The

   provoked the development of cracks into the coating as well as
   martensitic transformations (beta/L1(0)) within the beta-NiAl phase. The

AB Cobalt-based superalloys with a gamma/gamma' microstructure were
   discovered in 2006 and are currently being investigated as an
   alternative to nickel-based superalloys for high-temperature, high-load
   applications in gas turbine blades. They promise a better castability
   combined with a similar creep strength. Superalloy turbine blades are
   commonly coated with oxidation resistant bond coats. For this reason
   their compatibility needs to be studied. Co-9Al-9W specimens with a
   gamma/gamma' microstructure were coated with either a nickel-based or
   cobalt-based MCrAlY bond coat using vacuum plasma spraying. After aging
   at 900 degrees C in air for up to 500 h no decomposition of the gamma'
   phase was found in the bulk superalloy. The interdiffusion zone shows
   several different W-rich topologically close-packed phases arising from
   the dissolution of the gamma' phase in this region. The W-rich phases
   are identified to be mu phase for both bond coats and R phase for the
   nickel-based bond coat only. Their total volume is higher for the
   nickel-based bond coat. Therefore the cobalt-based bond coat is better
   suited for the Co-based superalloy substrate. Room temperature hardness
   and Young's modulus were measured using nanoindentation in the initial
   state and after heat treatment. A significantly higher Young's modulus
   was found for the cobalt-based bond coat (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

AB Hot deformation behaviors of a typical nickel-based superalloy are
   investigated by isothermal compression tests under the deformation
   temperature range of 920-1040 degrees C and strain rate range of 0.001-1
   s(-1). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electron backscattered
   diffraction (EBSD) technique and transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
   are employed to study the evolution of hot deformed microstructures. It
   is found that the fraction of low angle grain boundaries decreases with
   the increase of deformation temperature or the decrease of strain rate.
   This is related to the decrease of dynamic recrystallization degree
   under the low deformation temperature or high strain rate. The fraction
   of low angle grain boundaries shows a rapid increase at the relatively
   small deformation degree, and then a significant decrease due to the
   progress of dynamic recrystallization (DRX). The microstructural changes
   indicate that both continuous dynamic recrystallization (CDRX) and
   discontinuous dynamic recrystallization (DDRX) take place during hot
   deformation. However, the small fraction of low angle boundaries with
   10-15 degrees misorientation indicates that the CDRX plays a minor role
   on the nucleation of dynamic recrystallization. Discontinuous dynamic
   recrystallization (DDRX) characterized by grain boundary bulging is the
   dominant nucleation mechanism for the studied superalloy. (C) 2015

   The objective of this work is to compare the microstructure and the
   mechanical properties of the produced specimens, directly after the
   manufacturing process and additionally after two diverse heat treatments
   subsequent to the manufacturing process. As the resulting microstructure
   and properties for specimens manufactured by selective laser melting are
   directional, all investigations are made for specimens oriented
   vertically and horizontally. Optical, scanning, and transmission
   electron microscopy are carried out in order to characterize the
   microstructure explicitly. For investigating the texture of the
   material, additional EBSD measurements are undertaken. Mechanical tests
   include tensile testing at room temperature and at elevated temperatures
   and hardness measurements. The investigations reveal a very good quality
   of the SLM-produced specimens. Nonetheless, differences in the grain
   sizes, the orientation, and especially in the precipitation behavior
   could be found.

   -Ni(Co)Al, decorated with various (Ni,Co)(3)Al, Ta(Ti,Nb)C, and
   W(Cr,Mo)(3)B-2 precipitates. On the Cr2AlC side, an additional similar
   to 40-mu m Al-depletion zone of Cr7C3 formed an interconnected network
   with the -Ni(Co)Al. On the superalloy side, enhanced carbide
   precipitation developed over a depth of similar to 80 mu m. Subsequent
   annealing for 100h and 1000h at 800 degrees C coarsened some features,
   enhanced TCP precipitation in the superalloy, but only enlarged the
   diffusion layers by similar to 5 mu m at most. Because of Al depletion
   from the MAX phase and corresponding Al enrichment of the alloy, the
   reaction zone displayed similarities to an oxidized Cr2AlC surface and
   an aluminized superalloy, respectively. Published 2015. This article is

   of 920-1040 degrees C. Optical microscopy (OM) and transmission electron
   microscopy (TEM) are employed to investigate the evolution of dynamic
   recrystallized (DRX) grain and dislocation substructure. It is found
   that the effects of deformation degree, strain rate and deformation
   temperature on DRX grain are significant. When the deformation degree or
   temperature is increased, the number of DRX grains rapidly increases.
   But, the increase of strain rate reduces the number of DRX grains. The
   dislocation substructure is also very sensitive to the deformation
   degree, strain rate and deformation temperature. With the increase of
   deformation degree, the evolution of dislocation substructure can be
   characterized as: high dislocation density --> dislocation network -->
   subgrain --> DRX grain. Under high deformation temperatures or low
   strain rates, the dislocation substructure can be easily annihilated and
   rearranged because of the occurrence of DRX. Based on the evaluated DRX
   volume fractions, the contour map is constructed to optimize the hot

   Creep tests are carried out under conditions of 700 degrees C/300 MPa

   the HT-X alloy at RT and 750 degrees C is 787 MPa and 624 MPa,
   respectively. When additional thermal exposure at 750 degrees C for 5400
   h is applied, the yield strength is decreased to 656 MPa at RT and 480
   MPa at 700 degrees C. For an aged specimen, the a/2<110> dislocation
   shearing process occurs when tensile testing is conducted at RT and 750
   degrees C. As the gamma' precipitate size increases in the specimen that
   is thermally exposed at 750 degrees C for 5400 h, Orowan bowing is the
   dominant dislocation process, and stacking faults develop in the gamma'
   precipitates at both RT and 700 degrees C. Dislocation slip combined
   with climb is the dominant mechanism under the creep testing conditions.
   The factors that affect the mechanical properties and deformation

   while the upper one is formed of a dense Cr2O3 layer with NiO, Cr2NiO4,
   and TiO2 inclusions, the bottom one mainly consists of alpha-Al2O3.
   Between the riblets, a TiO2 layer was formed on the top of Cr2O3 layer.
   First mechanical tests showed a promising riblet stability under the
   low-cycle fatigue load, under tension, and under quasi-cyclic bending
   load. The riblets also exhibit no severe failure by applying a
   quasi-cyclic bending stress of 900 MPa for 200 times. Furthermore,
   cyclic tensile loading with a mean load of 500MPa and an amplitude of

   dissolved only at higher temperatures of 1200 degrees C. Small amounts
   of Laves phases remained stable during aging at 1200 degrees C for 25h.
   The prediction of phases as well as their stability is also checked by

AB Nickel-base superalloy, Waspaloy, was linear friction welded (LFWed)

   tensile properties and microhardness of the weldments were investigated

   treated (PWHTed) condition. Mechanical properties were related to
   microstructures following examination by optical microscopy, high
   resolution scanning electron microscopy, and electron backscatter
   diffraction (EBSD). Analyses of the EBSD results in terms of the
   misorientation angle distribution, which represents the stored energy,
   were performed. In the as-LFWed condition, the yield strength (YS) and
   ultimate tensile strength CUTS) increased with axial shortening due to
   greater expulsion of the softened interfacial material toward the
   periphery as flash. In contrast, with increasing axial shortening the
   total elongation initially remained constant and then decreased. This
   was also related to the expulsion of the softened interfacial material
   into the bifurcated flash. Extensive dissolution of the strengthening
   phase (gamma') in the weld area during linear friction welding (LFW)
   contributed to the lower YS and UTS in the as-welded condition compared
   to the PWHTed condition where the gamma' particles were recovered. After
   performing post-weld heat treatment (PWHT), the total elongation
   improved due to the relaxation of stored energy and grain growth in the
   thermomechanically affected zone (TMAZ). Crown Copyright (C) 2015

AB In this work, the initiation of cellular recrystallization of a
   grit-blasted single-crystal superalloy has been investigated by combined
   TEM and EBSD techniques. Based on microstructure observations of the
   grit-blasted surface, the formation of dislocation tangles in gamma
   channel and stacking faults in gamma' precipitates has been validated.
   After subsequent annealing at 1100 degrees C for 30 min, in the original
   matrix, neighboring gamma' precipitates have partially dissolved and
   merged into localized irregular agglomerates; concurrently, dense
   dislocation walls have formed and transformed to subgrain boundaries.
   For cellular recrystallized region, the formation of twins played a
   significant role in lowering the energy for sub-solvus
   recrystallization, which facilitated the transformation process. (C)

AB In the present work we study the formation of grooves and ledges
   (typical size: <100 nm) at gamma/gamma' interfaces of single crystal
   Ni-base superalloys. We highlight previous work which documents the
   presence of such interface irregularities and shows that their number
   and size increases during high temperature exposure and creep. We use
   diffraction contrast stereo transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to
   provide new evidence for the presence of ledges and grooves near
   dislocations at gamma/gamma' interfaces after heat treatment and creep.
   We present a 2D model of the interfacial region which shows how
   dislocation stress fields alter local chemical potentials and drive
   diffusional fluxes which result in the formation of a groove. The
   results of the numerical study yield realistic groove sizes in relevant
   time scales. The results obtained in the present study suggest that the
   formation of grooves and ledges represents an elementary process which
   needs to be considered when rationalizing the kinetics of rafting, the
   directional coarsening of the gamma' phase. (C) 2015 Acta Materialia

AB In order to manufacture the qualified turbine blade, the gas turbine
   blade material stress level must be evaluated. Mar-M247 alloy is often
   used to cast into a gas turbine blade. Casting temperature, cooling
   curve and heat treatment process will influence the performance of gas
   turbine blade materials. Material properties determine the performance
   and the fatigue life of components. The material properties of the
   nickel base cast alloy are governed by its microstructure, and the
   heterogeneous nature of the microstructure has a significant influence
   on the observed macroscopic material behaviour. In the paper, the
   mesoscale finite element model is used to study the mechanical
   properties of Mar-M247 alloy with the representative volume element
   method, the elastic stiffness constant matrix is calculated with finite
   element homogenisation. The results show the tensile strength of the

AB Development of investment casting process has been a challenge for
   manufacturers of complex shape parts. Numerous experimental casting
   trials are typically carried out to determine the optimum casting
   parameters for fabrication of high-quality products. In this work, it is
   demonstrated that physical simulation of investment casting can
   successfully predict microstructure and hardness in as-cast complex
   shape parts. The physical simulation tool consists of a thermal model
   and melting/solidification experiments in thermo-mechanical simulator.
   The thermal model is employed to predict local cooling rate during
   solidification at each point of a casting. Melting/solidification
   experiments are carried out under controlled cooling rates estimated by
   the thermal model. Microstructural and mechanical characterization of
   the solidified specimens is performed; the obtained results predict the
   local microstructure and mechanical properties of the casting. This
   concept is applied to investment casting of complex shape nozzle guide
   vanes from Mar-M247 Ni-based superalloy. Experimental casting trials are
   performed and the outcomes of physical simulation tool are validated
   against experimental results. It is shown that phase composition,
   secondary dendrite arm spacing, grain size, gamma/gamma' eutectic size
   and volume fraction, size and shape of carbide particles, and local
   microhardness can be predicted at each point of the casting via physical
   simulation. (C) The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society and ASM

AB Thermo-Span alloy is an oxidation resistant low thermal expansion
   superalloy and shows good mechanical properties, which has been used to
   fabricate components in gas turbine engine to control the clearance
   between static and rotating part, and thus improve the efficiency. Owing
   to the insufficient Cr, it was not applicable for this alloy to employ
   long homogenisation treatment at high temperature, and consequently, the
   primary Laves phase formed during the solidification process might be
   remained in this alloy. However, few studies were carried out on
   studying the role of primary Laves phase in this alloy. This paper
   studied the effects of primary Laves phase particles on the crack
   initiation and propagation during tensile test at room temperature, 650
   and 750 degrees C of the rolled bar made from casting Thermo-Span alloy.
   It was found that at room temperature, cracks were mainly related with
   the Laves phase larger than 5 mu m and the Laves clusters. At 650
   degrees C, cracks were formed preferentially at large Laves particles,
   but they would propagate faster at grain boundaries. At 750 degrees C,
   as the hardening effect of gamma' phase was not effective, and the
   stress concentrated at large Laves phase would be released by grain
   deformation, so that large cracks were no longer widely spread and more
   intergranular cracks especially at surface of the specimen were found.

   investigated. Five different types of flexible coupling have been
   considered, which is realized by four different metallic materials:
   three stainless steels (AISI 309, AISI 321, and AISI 321 Ti) and a
   nickel alloy (Incoloy 825). These components have been tested by a
   specific procedure developed to reproduce the real working conditions of
   the flexible joints (mechanical stresses, thermal stresses, and chemical
   attacks). The aging procedure consisting of different cycles of fatigue,
   heating and corrosion was performed. The performance of components was
   compared in terms of variation of both mechanical strength and the
   effect of corrosion, by means of the critical to quality approaches. The
   fatigue aging process presented in this work reproduced properly the
   real damage conditions on automotive flexible coupling, and the analysis
   of the critical to quality results shows that the best components for
   this application are those made up of Incoloy 825.

AB Inconel 718 is a nickel-chromium-based superalloy, and it is widely used
   in power industry because of its resistance to high-temperature
   environments. Treatment of the alloy becomes essential to prevent
   niobium segregation at the surface. Laser controlled melting and gas
   assisted nitriding is one of the methods to minimize changes in the
   elemental composition of the alloy surface. In general, high pressure
   nitrogen assisting gas is used coaxially with the laser beam to form a
   nitride layer and avoiding high-temperature exothermic oxidation
   reactions in the laser-irradiated region. The present study is carried
   out to model and simulate sequentially coupled thermal-diffusion process
   during laser assisted surface nitriding of nickel-chromium-based
   superalloy in line with experimental conditions. High pressure nitrogen
   gas jet is considered to impinge onto a workpiece surface coaxially with
   the laser beam during the treatment process. Finite element model is
   incorporated to predict the nitrogen concentration and temperature in
   the laser treated layer. It is found that the predictions of surface
   temperature and nitriding are found to be in close agreement with the
   experimental data. The study is extended to include the effect of laser
   intensity on the nitriding behavior. (C) 2015 Laser Institute of

   nickel and cobalt based superalloys by low velocity oxyfuel (LVOF)

   high temperature oxidation behaviour of coated and uncoated superalloys

   materials, whereas Al2O3-40TiO(2) coated Superco 605 superalloy has

   was found that the highly deformed areas at the coating-substrate

AB A new low cost hot-corrosion resistant Ni-Fe-Cr based superalloy is
   designed and fabricated. The microstructure evolution, mechanical
   properties and effect of minor Cr variation on the microstructure
   stability during long-term thermal exposure have been investigated in
   details. Microstructure observations reveal that the new Ni-Fe-Cr based
   superalloy is constituted of gamma matrix, gamma' precipitate, primary
   MC carbide and grain boundary (GB) M23C6 carbide after standard heat
   treatment. During long-term thermal exposure at 850 degrees C, the
   gamma' precipitate coarsens greatly within 3000 h, which significantly
   degrades the room temperature hardness and stress-rupture life at 800
   degrees C/294 MPa. The primary MC degenerates gradually by reactions of
   MC + gamma -> M23C6 + gamma', MC + gamma -> M23C6 + M6C + gamma' and MC
   + gamma -> M23C6 + M6C + eta, respectively. The growth of carbide and
   gamma' along GB changes it from thin discontinuous chain structure to
   coarse continuous chain structure, which might lead to the intergranular
   fracture during stress-rupture. In addition, small amount of grain
   interior (GI) M23C6 carbide precipitates in the matrix, which has
   negligible influence on the stress-rupture property. Moreover, minor
   increase of Cr content (from 20% to 21%) extends the precipitating
   temperature range of sigma phase and enhances its precipitating peak
   temperature, which results in a large amount of r phase precipitates in
   the Ni-Fe-Cr based superalloy during long-term thermal exposure at 850
   degrees C. The formation of sigma phase increases the room temperature
   hardness but degrades the stress-rupture life and elongation of the
   Ni-Fe-Cr based superalloy greatly. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB Traditional processing routes for Grain Boundary Engineering (GBE) often
   require multiple iterations of cold work followed by short annealing
   cycles. Since each iteration of deformation and annealing imparts a
   modest increase in the fraction of twin and special grain boundaries,
   multiple iterations are required to achieve a sufficiently high fraction
   (similar to 50%) of special grain boundaries that result in the improved
   properties. This GBE approach therefore is not suitable for the
   fabrication of large, complex shaped structures and leads to added
   manufacturing lead time and cost. In this investigation, the effect of
   deformation parameters on powder processed Ni-base superalloy RR1000 was
   investigated. By systematically quantifying the effects of deformation
   temperature (1100-1020 degrees C), strain rate (0.05-0.001/s) and the
   post deformation annealing temperature (1115 degrees C and 1145 degrees
   C), a set of optimized processing parameters were identified such that
   the length fraction of Sigma 3 boundaries increased from 35% to 52%
   following a single deformation anneal cycle. Deformation parameters (T >
   1060 degrees C and (epsilon) over dot < 0.01/s) that resulted in strain
   accommodation via superplastic flow or grain boundary sliding/rotations
   did not enhance the formation of Sigma 3 boundaries upon annealing.
   Whereas deformation parameters that resulted in a transition in the
   dominant deformation mechanism from superplastic flow to dislocation
   plasticity (T < 1060 degrees C and (epsilon) over dot > 0.001/s)
   promoted the formation of annealing twins, which are key for grain

   localized on Mar-M247 side, outside the heat-affected zone (HAZ), and
   the resistance to plastic deformation of Mar-M247 increased with a

   case, welding defects in the form of clusters of nanometer-sized oxide
   and carbide particles were observed at the fracture surfaces. These
   results revealed that the IFW process is capable of producing the weld
   joints between Mar-M247 and LSHR with the fracture strength higher than
   that of Mar-M247. However, optimization of the IFW processing parameters
   is required to minimize clustering of oxide/carbide particles at the

   C has been investigated in a solid-solution-strengthened Haynes 230
   superalloy. The proprietary direct aging combined with controlled
   cooling rate led successfully to the transition of serrated grain
   boundaries. The serrated grain boundaries were found to have plane
   normal terminated by low-index planes. The lamellar carbides formed by
   discontinuous precipitation process became more significant in the
   serrated specimen, as the aging temperature to which the specimen was
   slow-cooled from 1280 degrees C decreased. The fine intragranular
   carbides which precipitate during initial stage of creep are responsible
   for the strong hardening effect by pinning the dislocations in the
   standard specimen. The serrated grain boundaries with stable planar
   M23C6 carbides enhanced highly creep ductility due to their high
   resistance to cavitation cracking. However, the serrated specimens
   exhibited a higher creep rate, which is attributed to the promotion of
   intragranular deformation due to the lack of fine intragranular
   carbides, as well as cavitation at the lamellar carbides. Based on the
   relationships between microstructural factors and creep behaviors at 900
   degrees C, the optimal microstructure is discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier

AB This paper investigated the effect of surface recrystallization (RX) on
   the low cycle fatigue (LCF) behaviour of a single crystal (SX)
   superalloy. LCF tests on both raw and recrystallized samples showed that
   fatigue life was significantly reduced by surface RX. Fractography
   indicated that fatigue cracks initiated from the casting defects in RX
   layer and multiple crack initiations were commonly observed. Moreover,
   RX grains exhibited predominantly transgranular cracking, in contrast to
   the intergranular fracture reported in literature. The fatigue crack
   propagation behaviour was discussed in light of fracture mechanics and
   crack growth life model. The fatigue cycles required to penetrate RX
   layer were estimated to be about one magnitude lower than that in
   forming an equivalent crack in SX specimens. It is suggested that the
   earlier crack initiation and promoted crack propagation in RX layer, as
   well as the trend of multiple initiations, are responsible for the
   fatigue degradation by RX.

AB The hot compression tests for the nickel-based C276 superalloy were
   carried out on a Gleeble-1500D simulator in the temperature range of
   950-1250 degrees C with the strain rate range of 0.01-10.0 s(-1). The
   high-temperature deformation behaviors of C276 superalloy were analyzed
   based on the true stress-true strain curves. The results show that
   during the hot deformation process of C276 superalloy, under the same
   temperature, the flow stress rises with the increasing of strain rate.
   At the same strain rate, the flow stress decreases with the increasing
   of the temperature. As the strain rate is less than 1.0 s(-1), there
   exist peak stress and steady flow stress, and only peak stress appears
   at 10.0 s(-1). The processing maps of C276 superalloy in different
   strains were constructed according to DMM model. A small area where the
   power dissipation efficiency is higher than that in others areas exists
   in the maps. In this area the deformation temperature and strain rate is
   1050-1150 degrees C, 0.01-0.1 s(-1), and the fully dynamic
   recrystallization has been completed. There exists a small area of
   rheological instability in the processing map where the temperature is
   low, while the strain rate is high, and the dynamic recrystallization
   grains are distributed along the adiabatic shearing zone. According to
   the microstructure evolution and the processing maps of the C276
   superalloy, its suitable processing condition can be summed up as that
   the temperature range is between 1050 degrees C and 1150 degrees C, and
   the strain rate range is between 0.01 s(-1) and 0.1 s(-1). (C) 2014

   interdendritic segregation along the mushy zone of the quenched samples
   was measured and the corresponding concentration profiles are
   comparatively presented. The profiles are translated into liquid density
   profiles using a numerical model. It was deduced from this observation
   that, along the mushy zone of DWDS solidified samples, the content of
   elemental Al increased with increasing distance from the tip of the
   dendrites, but Re and W gradually decreased. The segregation profiles of
   these alloying elements in the Bridgman solidified samples demonstrated
   the same tendency. The results of density calculations suggest that the
   interdendritic melt becomes lighter with increasing depth in the mushy
   zone of the Bridgman solidified samples. This indicates that density
   inversion occurred. The density profiles in the DWDS solidified samples
   showed an analogous tendency. However, due to the opposite direction of
   growth, the density inversion did not appear in the DWDSs' samples. This
   suggests that the DWDS process can essentially avoid the occurrence of
   freckles, caused by density inversion, which are serious macro-defects
   in single-crystal superalloy turbine blade. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

AB Powder metallurgy (PM) processing of nickel-based superalloys has been
   used for a wide range of near net-shape fine grained products. In this
   paper a novel forming process, i.e. direct forging of unconsolidated
   powder superalloys is proposed. In this process, encapsulated and
   vacuumed powder particles are heated up to a forming temperature and
   forged directly at high speed to the final shape, by using a high
   forming load. Experiments of direct powder forging have been conducted
   on an upsetting tool-set. Microstructure, relative density and hardness
   of the formed specimen have been investigated. A finite element model of
   the direct powder forging process has been established in DEFORM and
   validated by the comparisons of experimental with simulation results of
   load variation with stroke as well as relative density distribution. The
   stress state and the relative density variation have been obtained from
   FE simulation. The correlation between the stress and consolidation
   condition has been rationalised. The developed FE model can provide a
   guide to design the geometry and thickness of preform for direct powder
   forging. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. This is an

AB The next generation of aerospace gas turbine engines need to operate at
   higher temperatures and stresses to improve their efficiency and reduce
   emissions. These operating conditions are beyond the capability of
   existing nickel-base superalloys, requiring the development of new high
   temperature materials. Controlling the microstructures of these new
   materials is key to obtaining the required properties and, therefore, it
   is critical to understand how these alloys respond to processing and
   heat treatment. Here, the microstructural evolution of V207M, a new
   delta containing, nickel-base superalloy, has been investigated
   following heat treatment and forging. The solvus temperatures of the
   gamma' and delta phases, determined by differential scanning calorimetry
   and microscopy, were found to be similar to 985 and similar to 1060
   degrees C respectively. Isothermal forging of the alloy was conducted at
   1000, 1050 and 1100 degrees C, corresponding to different volume
   fractions of retained delta. Considerable softening was observed prior
   to steady state flow when forging at 1000 degrees C, whilst only steady
   state flow occurred at 1050 and 1100 degrees C. The steady state flow
   process was believed to be dominated by dynamic recovery in the gamma
   phase, with an activation energy of 407 kJmol(-1). Samples that
   exhibited flow softening also showed a significant change in the
   orientation of the delta precipitates, preferentially aligning normal to
   the forging axis, and this reorientation was thought to be the cause of
   the observed flow softening. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

   ranges of temperature and strain rate. Based on the experimental data,
   the effects of strain rate, deformation temperature, strain and delta
   phase (Ni3Nb) on the work-hardening behaviors are discussed in detail.
   The microstructures of the studied superalloy are observed to correlate
   with the complex dynamic deformation mechanisms. The experimental
   results show that the work-hardening behaviors of the studied superalloy
   are significantly affected by deformation temperature, strain rate,
   strain and delta phase. The work-hardening rate increases with the
   decrease of deformation temperature or the increase of strain rate. When
   the deformation degree is relatively small, delta phase can inhibit the
   dislocation movement and enhance the work-hardening behavior. However,
   with further straining, delta phase stimulates the occurrence of dynamic
   recrystallization and promotes the dynamic softening. When the
   deformation temperature is higher than the dissolution temperature of
   delta phase, the effects of delta phase on work-hardening behaviors are
   weakened. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Hot compressive deformation behaviors of the aged nickel-based

   experimental data, the processing maps are developed and correlated with
   the deformed microstructures of the studied nickel-based superalloy. The
   effects of initial aging time on the processing map and microstructures
   are discussed in detail. It is found that the processing map and
   microstructures are sensitive to the initial aging time. When the
   initial aging time is shorter than 12 h, the spherical and short
   needle-shaped delta phases (Ni3Nb) can stimulate the occurrence of
   dynamic recrystallization and improve the hot workability, as well as
   decrease the final forging temperature of the studied nickel-based
   superalloy. However, when the initial aging time is increased to 24 h,
   the excessive long needle-shaped delta phases appear and become the
   potential locations of wedge cracking, which easily leads to flow
   instability during hot deformation. The aged superalloy under 900
   degrees C for 9 h or 12 h is suitable for the hammer forging process.
   The optimum deformation parameters for the hammer forging process are
   1010-1040 degrees C and 0.1-1 s(-1). The aged superalloy under 900
   degrees C for 9 h can be used for the conventional die forging.
   Furthermore, the forging temperature should be controlled in the range
   of 980-1040 degrees C, and the strain rate should be lower than 0.1
   s(-1). The solution-treated superalloy or the aged superalloy under 900

   0.001-5 s(-1) on a Gleeble 1500 thermal-mechanical simulator. The flow
   curves and microstructural investigation indicates that dynamic
   recrystallization is the prime softening mechanism at the evaluated
   deformation conditions. The constitutive equation was presented as a
   function of the deformation temperature, strain rate, and strain, and
   the deformation activation energy was about 450 kJ/mol. The processing
   maps based on dynamic materials model at the strains of 0.2, 0.4, 0.6,
   0.8, and 1.0 were established, and the processing map at 1.0 strain
   shows good correspondence to the microstructural observation. The
   domains in processing map in which the efficiency of power dissipation

AB A very high-temperature reactor (VHTR) has been studied among generation
   IV nuclear power plants owing to its many advantages such as
   high-electric efficiency and massive hydrogen production. The material
   used for the heat exchanger should sustain structural integrity for its
   life even though the material is exposed to a harsh environment at 1223
   K (950 A degrees C) in an impure helium coolant. Therefore, an
   enhancement of the material performance at high temperature gives a
   margin in determining the operating temperature and life time. This work
   is an effort to find an optimum combination of alloying elements and
   processing parameters to improve the material performance. The tensile
   property and microstructure for nickel-based alloys fabricated in a
   laboratory were evaluated as a function of the heat treatment, cold
   working, and grain boundary strengthener using a tension test at 1223 K
   (950 A degrees C), scanning electron microscopy, and transmission
   electron microscopy. Elongation to rupture was increased by additional
   heat treatment and cold working, followed by additional heat treatment
   in the temperature range from 1293 K to 1383 K (1020 A degrees C to 1110
   A degrees C) implying that the intergranular carbide contributes to
   grain boundary strengthening. The temperature at which the grain
   boundary is improved by carbide decoration was higher for a cold-worked
   specimen, which was described by the difference in carbide stability and
   carbide formation kinetics between no cold-worked and cold-worked
   specimens. Zr and Hf played a scavenging effect of harmful elements

AB The evolution of the strengthening precipitate in a
   precipitation-hardening alloy, such as the gamma prime (gamma') phase in
   Ni-base superalloys, during heat treating and welding can affect the
   resultant mechanical properties significantly. Computational kinetics
   simulation can be a useful tool for understanding and controlling of
   such evolution. The present study was conducted to simulate the gamma'
   precipitation and dissolution during aging and welding of the recently
   developed Ni-base superalloy 718plus using the PanPrecipitation module
   of the Pandat software along with available thermodynamic and kinetic
   databases. The purpose was to demonstrate the application of such
   software and databases to materials processing including heat treating
   and welding. The variations in the volume fraction, average
   precipitation size, and number density of gamma' with time during aging
   and welding were calculated. The calculated results under aging
   condition agreed well with the available experimental data, while those
   under welding also predicted the correct trend.

AB NKH71 is a Re free nickel. based single crystal superalloy. The long.
   term creep strength of this alloy is superior to that of the practical
   used 2nd generation superalloy, CMSX-4, containing Re but the short.
   term creep strength is inferior to that of CMSX-4. This may be caused by
   the initial microstructure before creep. In order to arrange the initial
   morphology of the gamma' phase in NKH71, eight kinds of processes in
   heat treatment are carried out. After a series of heat treatments, each
   specimen is examined with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and
   transmission electron microscopy (TEM). From SEM, it is found that the
   initial morphology of the gamma' phase is different by the cooling rate
   after solution treatment and temperatures of 1st step aging. It is also
   found by TEM that dislocation density at the interface between the gamma
   and gamma' phase is different. In order to make clear the origin of the
   morphological difference in the each heat treatment, the phase field
   simulation is carried out on the basis of Gibbs free energy calculated
   using thermodynamic date of Ni-Al binary system.

   (CHC) for the deposition of 5 mu m of Pt layer and subsequent annealing
   at 1140 degrees C for 2 h in vacuum. The TBC system was thermally cycled
   in 1.25 h cycles at 1100 degrees C for 730 h (584 cycles) until
   delamination of 10% of Yttria Stabilized Zirconia (YSZ) top coating. A

   cycled conditions was studied using FEG-SEM. The growth and evolution of
   the Thermally Grown Oxide (TGO) scale was performed using high
   resolution FEG-S/TEM and Focused Ion Beam (FIB) methods. The TGO in the
   as-deposited condition was found to consist of porous alpha-Al2O3 which
   grew to form distinctive dense and columnar grains with ionic diffusion
   of reactive elements (Hf and Y) through grain boundaries during high
   temperature exposure. Additionally the formation of nanometric NiAl2O4
   islands as well as high volume oxides containing Ni was found to
   accelerate the spallation of the YSZ top coat. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB The paper presents the results of studies on the development of
   correlation of solidification parameters and chemical composition of
   nickel superalloy IN-713C, which is used i.a. on aircraft engine turbine
   blades. Previous test results indicate significant differences in
   solidification parameters of the alloy, especially the temperatures
   T-liq and T-sol for each batch of ingots supplied by the manufacturer.
   Knowledge of such a relationship has important practical significance,
   because of the ability to asses and correct the temperatures of casting
   and heat treatment of casts on the basis of chemical composition. Using
   the statistical analysis it was found that the temperature of the
   solidification beginning T-liq is mostly influenced by the addition of
   carbon (similar to iron alloys). The additions of Al and Nb have smaller
   but still significant impact. Other alloying components do not have
   significant effect on T-liq. The temperature T-eut is mostly affected by
   Ni, Ti and Nb. The temperature Tsol is not in any direct correlation
   with the chemical composition, which is consistent with previous
   research. The temperature Tsol depends primarily on the presence of
   non-metallic inclusions present in feed materials and introduced during
   the melting and casting processes.

PY 2014
AB The current demands of the aviation industry for increased gas-turbine
   efficiency necessitate higher turbine entry temperatures, requiring that
   alloys exhibit superior oxidation resistance. The synergistic effects of
   oxidation and mechanical stresses pose a complex issue. The purpose of
   the current research was to examine the effects of stress on the
   oxidation and oxygen transport in a commercial nickel-based superalloy.
   Fine grain RR1000 in both polished and shot-peened conditions was
   studied for classic (zero load) and statically loaded conditions using
   integrated two-stage isotopic tracing combined with focused-ion-beam
   secondary ion mass spectrometry (FIB-SIMS). Cr2O3 external oxide formed
   with semicontinuous TiO2 above and below. Preferential grain boundary
   Al2O3 internal oxide formation, gamma'-dissolution, and
   recrystallization occurred subsurface. Oxidation mechanisms were
   dominated by anionic/cationic growth in the external oxide with inward
   oxygen transport, initially through the partially unprotective external
   oxide, then along internal oxide/alloy interfaces. Loading did not
   influence the oxidation products formed but did bring about expedited
   oxidation kinetics and changes to the oxide morphology. The oxygen
   diffusivity D-O* (x10(-13) cm(2)s(-1)) ranged from 0.39 for the polished
   alloy to 3.7 for the shot-peened condition under compressive stress.
   Arguably, the most significant effects took place in the subsurface
   regions. Increased oxidation kinetics were attributed to the development
   of fast cation diffusion paths as the alloy deformed by creep.

AB The microstructure of Allvac 718 Plus (718 Plus; ATI, Pittsburgh, PA,
   USA) superalloy was examined after linear friction welding (LFW) and
   after standard postweld heat treatment (PWHT). The liquid phase reaction
   of second-phase precipitates, which are known to constitutionally
   liquate during conventional fusion welding, was observed in the
   thermomechanically affected zone (TMAZ) of the welded material. These
   phases included MC-type carbides, Ti-rich carbonitrides, and delta phase
   precipitates. This observation is contrary to the general assumption
   that LFW is a completely solid-state joining process. However, unlike
   conventional fusion welding processes that cause heat-affected zone
   liquation cracking in 718 Plus and many other superalloys, the LFW
   process did not cause cracking in 718 Plus superalloy despite the
   liquation of precipitates. This absence of cracking during joining is
   attributed to the applied compressive stress during the forging stage of
   the LFW process. Also, no cracking was observed after PWHT, although
   PWHT resulted in a microstructure that had a nonhomogeneous distribution
   of precipitates in the weld and the TMAZ.

   refinement, microsegregation and porosity distribution, and compared to
   those using a Bridgman process. The G(L) of the process was 200-236

   well as 272 mu m and 76 mu m in the CMSX-6 and the CMSX-4 castings,

   from 1.2 mu m to 0.6 mu m, respectively. The average areas of
   (gamma'+gamma) eutectic pools became smaller and more homogeneously
   distributed. The mean pore sizes in the castings were reduced by 57% and
   43% for the CMSX-6 and CMSX-4 superalloys, respectively, and the area
   fractions of the pores in the CMSX-6 and CMSX-4 samples were 16% and 12%
   of those produced in the Bridgman samples. The segregation coefficients
   of the major alloying elements were closer to unity than those in the

AB Micro-structural instability at the surface that develops during
   solution heat treatment of a typical third generation Ni-base
   superalloy, CMSX10N has been reported. It is shown that elemental Ni
   vaporizes from the surface during solutioning leading to
   de-stabilization of gamma phase. With increasing extent of vaporization,
   a phase mixture of beta, gamma', and the refractory (W and Re-rich)
   precipitates occur within the surface layers resulting in the complete
   breakdown of the cuboidal gamma/gamma' phase morphology that is usually
   observed. It is demonstrated that the conditions at the surface have a
   marked effect on the vaporization kinetics and subsequent evolution of
   surface phases-the presence of a continuous dense oxide such as Al2O3 or
   the presence of sacrificial Ni-foils interspersed in the furnace
   significantly suppresses elemental vaporization from the sample surface.

   established. For this purpose, isothermal, hot compression tests were
   performed at temperatures ranging from 1144 K (871 A degrees C) and 22 K
   (22 A degrees C) below the respective gamma-prime solvus temperatures (T
   (gamma')) and strain rates between 0.0003 and 10 s(-1). Deformed samples
   were then heat treated 20 K (20 A degrees C) above the solvus for 1 h
   with selected additional samples exposed for shorter and longer times.
   For both alloys, the grain size developed during SSHT was in the range
   of 15 to 30 mu m, except for those processing conditions consisting of
   pre-deformation at the highest temperature, i.e., T (gamma')-22 K (T
   (gamma')-22 A degrees C), and strain rates in the range of similar to
   0.001 to 0.1 s(-1). In these latter instances, the heat-treated grain
   size was approx. four times as large. The observations were interpreted
   in terms of the mechanisms of deformation during hot working and their
   effect on the driving forces for grain-boundary migration which controls
   the evolution of the gamma-grain size.

AB One of the major concerns related to machining of Ni-based super alloy
   is surface integrity since it directly affects the performance of the

   study, the influence of cutting speed (51,84 and 124 m/min) and CVD
   multilayer tool coating (TiN/TiCNIAl2O3/ZrCN) on various aspects of
   surface integrity such as surface roughness, crystal structure and
   microstructure of the surface and sub-surface region, thickness of white
   layer and work hardening tendency have been investigated during dry
   turning of Incoloy 825. Particular emphasis has been given to understand
   the mechanism of formation of modified surface layer and the associated
   process of dynamic recrystallization. The study indicated coated tool
   resulted in better surface finish compared to that obtained with
   uncoated tool only at high cutting speed. Various macro features of
   machined surface included feed mark, material smearing, surface
   ploughing, re-deposited materials and chip debris. Transformation of
   crystallographic phase of the machined surface could not be detected
   compared to that of bulk material. Increase in cutting speed caused
   gradual refinement of grains, and increased white layer thickness.
   Coated tool, on the other hand, resulted in the generation of large
   number of nucleation sites and consequently finer grains at high cutting
   speed, whereas the uncoated tool promoted growth of sharply defined
   recrystallized grains. The coated tool prevented the formation of white
   layer at low and medium cutting speed and also decreased work hardening
   tendency of Incoloy 825 when compared with that of uncoated tool. (C)

   crystal (SC) superalloy with or without an electro-plated Pt film by
   electron beam physical vapor deposition (EB-PVD), respectively.
   Co-doping of Cr and Si caused grain refinement of the coatings and
   retarded outward diffusion of Pt during heat-treatment in vacuum at 1050
   degrees C. During cyclic oxidation at 1150 degrees C, severe scale
   spallation occurred in the Pt-free coating due to the formation of voids
   beneath the oxide scale. The Pt modified coating effectively suppressed
   the formation and growth of voids and exhibited improved
   cyclic-oxidation resistance. Si-doping not only reduced the oxidation
   rate of the coating but also enhanced the oxide scale adherence, one of
   mechanisms for which is that the addition of Si in the coating prevented
   outward diffusion of refractory elements such as Mo from the alloy
   substrate. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Inducing thermo-mechanical loads during the machining of hard materials
   lead to the severe grain refinement and hardness variation into the
   machined surface. This variation significantly affects the performance
   and the service quality of the products. Inconel 718 superalloy is one
   of the difficult-to-machine materials employed widely in aerospace
   industries and its surface characteristics after final machining process
   is really important. The main objective of this study is to implement a
   reliable finite element (FE) model for orthogonal machining of Inconel
   718 alloy and prediction of the microstructure changes during the
   process. At first, experimental results of cutting forces, chip geometry
   and maximum temperature were taken into account to identify the most
   suitable material model out of the seven models found in the literature.
   Then, the FE numerical model was properly calibrated using an iterative
   procedure based on the comparison between simulated and experimental
   results. Moreover, a user subroutine was implemented in FE code to
   simulate the dynamic recrystallization and, consequently, to predict
   grain refinement and hardness variation during the orthogonal cutting of
   Inconel 718 alloy. Zener-Hollomon and Hall-Petch equations were employed
   to respectively predict the grain size and microhardness. In addition,
   the depth of the affected layer was controlled using the critical strain
   equation. As overall, a very good agreement has been found between the
   experimental and simulated results in term of grain size, microhardness
   and depth of the affected layer. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB In Alloy 718, a sharp transition exists in the fracture path changing
   from an intergranular brittle mode to a transgranular ductile mode which
   is associated with a transition of flow behavior from smooth in the
   dynamic strain aging regime to a serrated one in the Portevin-Le
   Chatelier (PLC) regime. In order to better understand both deformation
   and rupture behavior, PLC phenomenon in a precipitation-hardened
   nickel-base superalloy was carefully investigated in a wide range of
   temperatures [573 K to 973 K (300 A degrees C to 700 A degrees C)] and
   strain rates (10(-5) to 3.2 x 10(-2) s(-1)). Distinction was made
   between two PLC domains characterized by different evolutions of the
   critical strain to the onset of the first serration namely normal and
   inverse behavior. The apparent activation energies associated with both
   domains were determined using different methods. Results showed that
   normal and inverse behavior domains are related to dynamic interaction
   of dislocations with, respectively, interstitial and substitutional
   solutes atoms. This analysis confirms that normal PLC regime may be
   associated to the diffusion of carbon atoms, whereas the substitutional
   species involves in the inverse regime is discussed with an emphasis on
   the role of Nb and Mo.

PY 2014
AB Electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) has been employed to study a
   polycrystalline nickel superalloy containing a complex nonmetallic
   agglomerate under thermal loading. Heterogeneous distributions of
   elastic strains are observed near the inclusion due to its complex
   geometry and these have been quantified. Lattice rotations were also
   related to geometrically necessary dislocation (GND) density similar to
   10(14) m(-2)), indicating the development of localized plasticity
   arising from the mismatch in thermal expansivity between the Ni
   polycrystal and the inclusion. A crystal plasticity finite-element
   (CPFE) model which explicitly represents the full detail of the complex
   microstructure was developed to interpret the experimental measurements,
   and good quantitative and qualitative agreement has been obtained.
   However, a limitation of the EBSD technique when investigating
   polycrystal systems is that full-field, transgranular strain measurement
   remains difficult due to the necessity to reference a lattice spacing
   within a grain for strain calculation. An inverse reference shifting
   methodology has been developed using CPFE modeling to overcome this
   problem, thereby allowing like-for-like and grainby-grain strain
   comparisons to be made. The method, in conjunction with high-resolution
   EBSD, shows promise for the determination of full-field strains and
   rotations in polycrystalline materials, and provides key information for
   fatigue nucleation in these material systems. (C) 2014 Acta Materialia

AB Hot deformation behavior of Incoloy 901 Ni-based superalloy was
   investigated by performing hot compression tests over the temperature
   range of 950-1100 degrees C and at strain rates of 0.001-1 s(-1). The
   flow curves at low strain rates i.e. 0.001-0.1 s(-1), were characterized
   by a faint peak or a long plateau after the work hardening region. Only
   at high strain rates, e.g. 1 s(-1), the flow curves exhibited sharp
   peaks of dynamic recrystallization. The strain associated with the peak
   points of flow curves firstly increases with strain rate (up to 0.01
   s(-1)) and then unexpectedly decreased at higher strain rates. These
   anomalous results were attributed to the change in the kinetics of
   dynamic softening mechanisms. The constitutive analysis of flow stress
   suggested a change in the hot deformation behavior of the alloy with
   increasing temperature (over 1050 degrees C) or strain rate (over 0.01
   s(-1)). Microstructural characterization showed that although dynamic
   recrystallization would operate over the whole studied ranges of
   deformation temperature and strain rate, its kinetics was generally
   sluggish. However, the rate of recrystallization increased remarkably at
   temperatures beyond 1050 degrees C or strain rate over 0.01 s(-1).
   Electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) measurements and optical
   microscopy observations showed that the nucleation of recrystallization
   around the grain boundaries or second-phase particles should be due to
   the gradual evolution of subgrains. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   carbide and NbC particles are also found to be present. Heat treatment
   of the alloy at 1373 K for 30 min followed by water quenching (WQ)
   brings about a microstructure that is free from secondary carbides and
   Ni3Al type precipitates but contains primary carbides. Tensile property
   of Alloy 693 materials was measured with as received and solution
   annealed (1323 K, 60 min, WQ) and (1373 K, 30 min, WQ) conditions. Yield
   strength, ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and hardness of the alloy are
   found to drop with annealing. It is noted that in annealed condition,
   considerable cold working of the alloy can be performed. (C) 2014

   high-temperature tensile tests and microstructure analysis. M C-23(6) at
   the grain boundaries (GBs) has a cube-on-cube coherence with one grain
   in the NiCrFe-7 weld metals, and the adjacent M C-23(6) has the
   coherence relationship with the same grain. The grain with a coherent M
   C-23(6) has a Cr-depletion region. The number and size of M C-23(6)
   particles can be adjusted by heat treatment and alloying. There are two
   temperatures [T (E1): 923 K to 1083 K (650 A degrees C to 810 A degrees
   C) and T (E2): 1143 K to 1203 K (870 A degrees C to 930 A degrees C)] at
   which the GBs and grains of the NiCrFe-7 welding rod have equal strength
   during the high-temperature tensile test. When the temperatures are
   between T (E1) and T (E2), the strength of the GBs is lower than that of
   the grains, and the tensile fractures are intergranular. When the
   temperatures are below T (E1) or over T (E2), the strength of the GBs is
   higher than that of the grains, and the tensile fractures are dimples. M
   C-23(6) precipitates at the GBs, which deteriorates the ductility of the
   welding rods at temperature between T (E1) and T (E2). M C-23(6)
   aggravates ductility-dip-cracking (DDC) in the weld metals. The addition
   of Nb and Ti can form MX (M = Ti, Nb, X = C, N), fix C in grain,
   decrease the initial precipitation temperature of M C-23(6), and
   mitigate the precipitation of M C-23(6), which is helpful for minimizing
   DDC in the weld.

   configurations has been demonstrated in detail, involving five stages:
   after the first stress relaxation, after the first tensile plastic
   deformation, after the second stress relaxation, after 30 cycles and
   after rupture. In addition, for TMS-82 superalloy, there is a reversible
   movement behaviour of stacking faults that occur in compression and
   disappear in tension. After rupture, the number of dislocation is
   related to the hold time. Longer hold time could generate a higher
   degree of stress relaxation and produce more dislocations with climbing

   stoichiometric ratio of Ni-2(Cr, Mo) in this alloy. As increasing aging

   nm. Besides, morphology of the Ni-2(Cr, Mo) precipitated phases changes
   from a lean to a fat ellipse with increasing aging time due to the
   effect of the Mo/Cr atomic ratio and alloying elements on transformation
   paths from disorder to order. In addition, solution temperature of the

   experiments were performed on a NiCoCrAlY protective coating of a
   nickel-based superalloy and hardness and modulus of elasticity
   (mechanical properties) were determined by nanoindentation before and
   after the experiments. Microstructure and chemical composition were

AB Superalloys display a strong tendency toward chemical segregation during
   solidification. Therefore, it is of great importance to develop
   appropriate techniques for the melting and casting of superalloys.
   Elements partitioning between the gamma and gamma' phases in single
   crystal superalloys have been investigated by several authors using
   electron probe microanalysis (Hemmersmeier and Feller-Kniepmeier Mater
   Sci Eng A 248:87-97, 1998; Kearsey et al. Intermetallics 12:903-910,
   2004; Kearsey et al. Superalloys 2004, pp 801-810, 2004; D'Souza et al.
   Mater Sci Eng A 490:258-265, 2008). We examined the effect of the
   particular stages of standard heat treatment (solution treatment and
   ageing) applied to CMSX-4 single crystal superalloy on chemical
   segregation that occurs between dendrites and interdendritic areas.
   Dendritic structures were observed using a scanning electron microscope.
   Analyses of the chemical composition were performed using energy
   dispersive x-ray spectroscopy. The obtained qualitative and quantitative
   results for the concentrations of elements enabled us to confirm the
   dendritic segregation in as-cast CMSX-4 superalloy. The concentrations
   of some refractory elements (tungsten, rhenium) were much greater in
   dendrites than in interdendritic areas. However, these differences in
   chemical composition gradually decreased during heat treatment. The
   results obtained in this study warrant further examination of the
   diffusion processes of elements during heat treatment of the
   investigated superalloy, and of the kinetics of diffusion.

AB The prediction of the viscoplastic behavior of nickel-based single
   crystal superalloys remains a challenging issue due to the complex
   loadings encountered in aeronautical engine components such as high
   pressure turbine blades. Under particular in-service conditions, these
   materials may experience temperature cycles which promote the
   dissolution of the strengthening gamma' phase of the material on
   (over)heating, and subsequent precipitation on cooling, leading to a
   transient viscoplastic behavior.
   Within this context, a model was recently developed by Cormier and
   Cailletaud (2010) to fulfill the effects of fast microstructure
   evolutions occurring upon high temperature non-isothermal loadings. New
   internal variables were introduced in the crystal plasticity framework
   to take into account microstructure evolutions such as gamma'
   dissolution/precipitadon and dislocation recovery processes which are
   known to control the creep behavior and life. Nevertheless, this model
   did not consider the gamma' directional coarsening, one of the main
   microstructural evolutions occurring specifically at high temperature.
   In addition, no kinematic hardening was considered to describe the
   mechanical behavior, leading to a poor description of cyclic loadings.
   This paper details the development of a new model by introducing new
   internal variables for both modeling the gamma' directional coarsening
   and the evolutions of isotropic and kinematic hardening under complex
   loading paths.
   This model was calibrated using monotonous and cyclic experiments
   performed on [001] oriented single-crystal samples and both under
   isothermal and non-isothermal conditions. Thereby, it is able to predict
   microstructural evolutions for complex thermal and mechanical loadings
   as well as internal stress evolutions whatever the thermomechanical
   history. The model efficiency was highlighted by comparing FEM
   simulation and experimental results of a non-isothermal creep test on a
   notched sample (i.e. under complex mechanical stress state). (C) 2014

AB Layer by layer fabrication using micro-laser aided additive
   manufacturing (micro-LAAM) was successfully implemented on nickel-base
   superalloy IN100. It is known that IN100, a type of superalloy having
   high titanium and aluminum contents, has poor weldability due to weld
   liquation cracking in the heat-affected zone (HAZ) and strain age
   cracking. In this study, micro-LAAM process was optimized through a set
   of designed experiments to eliminate crack formation and reduce
   porosity. It was found that the crack-free deposition can be achieved
   owing to the fact that micro-LAAM process used in this study had very
   low heat input. Three distinct sizes of gamma ' precipitates were
   observed on the post heat-treated samples. The volume fractions of gamma
   to gamma ' phases were found to be approximately 60-40%. Microstructure
   and chemical analysis results showed that gamma ' phase was embedded
   within gamma-Ni matrix while various carbides (MC, M23C6 and M6C) were
   observed as precipitates at grain boundaries or within grains. Electron
   backscatter diffraction (EBSD) was used to compare grain morphologies
   and size distribution of three distinctly different regions on each
   layer. The achieved ultimate tensile strength and yield strength are
   much better than the minimum requirements specified in aerospace
   material specification 5397 for cast IN100. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB Modelling and targeted experimentation on the rod casting with ceramic
   core were used to quantify the plasticity, recrystallisation during the
   subsequent solution heat treatment, as a result of the different thermal
   contractions of the metal, ceramic shell and core during directional
   solidification. Thermal-elastic-plastic analysis was carried out with
   the high temperature plasticity assumed to be the rate independent,
   considering the orthotropic characteristics of single crystal nickel
   base superalloys. The calculation results indicate that the plasticity
   occurs mainly during two stages: the initial solidification stages
   (around solidus) owing to its low immediate yield strength, and the
   later solidification stage (below 800 degrees C) due to the thermal
   contraction. The influential factors, such as wall and shell thickness,
   flanges, etc., are analysed. Experimentally, recrystallisation takes
   place in the thin walled areas due to broken or buckled cores, which
   agrees well with the plasticity calculations.

   thermal gradient on the castings. Comparing with traditional high rate
   solidification prepared DZ125 superalloy, the results show that element
   segregation such as Al, Ti, W and Mo was decreased with high thermal
   gradients or high withdraw rates, the precipitation of low melting phase
   in the interdendritic region was suppressed and the sizes of eutectic

   at 980 degrees C/235 MPa after heat treatment. Obvious stress-rupture
   improvement has been observed, and the stress-rupture life decrease at

   investigate the forming of precipitates at different temperature stages,
   interrupt quenching was used during the cooling process. As the results
   show, the gamma' precipitates change from monomodal to multimodal size
   distributions with quenching temperature. On the one hand, the large

   Charpy V-Notch impact energy in the range of 48-54 J. Stress relieving
   heat treatment at 950 degrees C for 1 h has resulted in marginal
   improvement in the impact toughness by about 10%, whereas no clear
   evidence of such improvement is seen in the CTOD fracture toughness.
   Fractographic examination of the Charpy specimens and the results of the

   discharge in the standing-wave mode at a pressure of 40 Pa and a power
   500W. Simultaneous heating of the samples was realized by focusing
   concentrated solar radiation from a 5 kW solar furnace directly onto the
   samples. The morphological changes upon treatment were monitored using
   scanning electron microscopy, compositional depth profiling was
   performed using Auger electron spectroscopy, while structural changes
   were determined by X-ray diffraction. The treatment in oxygen plasma
   caused formation of metal oxide clusters of three dimensional
   crystallites initially rich in nickel oxide with the increasing chromium
   oxide content as the temperature was increasing. At about 1100K iron and
   niobium oxides prevailed on the surface causing a drop of the material
   emissivity at 5 pm. Simultaneously the NiCr2O4 compound started growing
   at the interface between the oxide film and bulk alloy and the compound
   persisted up to temperatures close to the Inconel melting point.
   Intensive migration of minority alloying elements such as Fe and Ti was
   observed at 1600K forming mixed surface oxides of sub-micrometer
   dimensions. The treatment in hydrogen plasma with small admixture of
   water vapor did not cause much modification unless the temperature was
   close to the melting point. At such conditions aluminum segregated on

   923 K to 1173 K (650 A degrees C to 900 A degrees C) and that the gamma
   aEuro(3) coarsening follows the LSW theory once these particles have an
   ellipsoidal morphology. The onset of grain growth, accompanied with an
   increase of the texture index, was observed at a temperature as low as
   1173 K (900 A degrees C). It results from the progressive dissolution of
   grain boundaries' secondary carbides (especially M6C carbides) at this
   temperature, a process that favors a greater mobility of grain
   boundaries. It is also shown that the forming process (shear spinning),
   even after a relaxation heat treatment, enhances and stabilizes the
   precipitation of the delta phase compared to as-rolled + solution
   heat-treated sheets. It hence slows down the precipitation of the gamma

   constant strain rate of 0.003/s, deformation temperatures were varied
   between 25 degrees C and 982 degrees C while strains varied between 11%
   and 80%. The resulting microstructures were characterized using electron
   back scatter diffraction both immediately following deformation and
   after an annealing cycle at 1025 degrees C. Comparison of the grain
   boundary characters associated with the samples enabled correlation of
   the processing parameters to the formation of desirable coherent twin
   boundaries and the identification of a deformation mechanism map.
   Processing parameters associated with strain annealing and dynamic
   recovery were found to promote the formation and retention of twin
   boundaries, while statically and dynamically recrystallized
   microstructures tend to contain large proportions of random grain
   boundaries that mitigate the effects of grain boundary engineering. (C)

AB Ni-base alloy DZ468 has been joined by transient liquid phase bonding
   technique with a newly developed Co-based filler. The microstructures of
   the Co-base filler and the joint, the effects of heat treatment on
   microstructure and hardness of the joint have been investigated by
   various experimental methods. Results show that the Co-base filler
   consists of gamma, M2B, M5B3 and M23B6 phases. Because of the
   interdiffusion between the base metal and the filler, gamma, MC, M5B3
   and M23B6 phases are formed in the bonding zone. And localized
   liquidation of substrate occurs in the diffusion affected zone, with MC
   and M3B2 precipitating in this area. During heat treatment, the volume
   of the intermetallic phases in the bonding zone resulting from
   incomplete isothermal solidification decreases obviously. On the
   contrary, the width of the diffusion affected zone increases at the
   solution stage and subsequently decreases at the aging stages.

AB The effect of post-weld heat treatment (PWHT) temperatures on the
   microstructure of Inconel 625 deposited metal (DM) was examined using an
   optical microscope (OM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and
   transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The transformation mechanism of
   the gamma '' -> delta phase and the grain growth kinetics of the gamma'
   phase during PWHT were revealed. The results indicate that the
   microstructure of as-welded DM is composed of columnar grains of
   different sizes, of which the average grain size is approximately 160 mu
   m. Certain precipitates, such as the dispersed gamma' phase, blocky
   MC-type carbide and irregular shape Laves phase, precipitate in the
   microstructure of the as-welded DM. Compared with as-welded DM, the
   microstructure of DM after PWHT at 650 degrees C for 4 h shows minimal
   variation. With an increase in PWHT temperature, a large number of
   body-centered tetragonal gamma '' phases precipitate at interdendrite
   regions in the microstructure of DM after PWHT at 750 degrees C for 4 h.
   When the PWHT temperature increases to 850 degrees C, the metastable
   gamma '' phase directly transforms into a stable delta phase in shear
   mode, which exhibits a similar chemical composition but a different
   crystal structure than the gamma '' phase. At 950 degrees C, the gamma
   '' phase and the d phase disappear, whereas certain M6C-type carbides
   precipitate at the grain boundaries. Alloying elements such as Nb, Mo,
   Si, Al and Fe in the microstructure of as-welded DM exhibit segregation
   behavior. Due to an increasing PWHT temperature, the segregation
   behavior constantly weakens with minimal evolution to the temperature of
   750 degrees C. Above this temperature, partition coefficients tend
   toward 1, and composition heterogeneity disappears at 950 degrees C.
   During PWHT, the gamma' phase continuously coarsens with an increase in
   PWHT temperature. The dynamic analysis shows that the coarsening
   behavior of the gamma' phase corresponds with the formula: (d) over bar
   (3) - (d) over bar (3)(0) - A . e(-Q/RT)/T . t with an activation energy
   of 253 kJ/mol. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   The experimental results show good adherence at all interfaces within

   interdiffusion behavior of the double-layer bond coat were also
   investigated. The double-layer bond coat system exhibits a better scale
   adherence than the single layer bond coat systems since the underlying

   Finally, thermal cycling behavior of the double-layer bond coat TBC was

   expansion mismatch stress between TGO and bond coat can be mainly
   responsible for the spallation of this coating. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB ALLVAC 718Plus is a new commercial superalloy derived from Inconel 718,
   but possessing a higher temperature capability whilst employing the same
   philosophy regarding the microstructure. Many articles have been
   published describing various heat treatments exploiting the
   precipitation of intermetallic phases at grain boundaries to optimize
   the mechanical properties over a range of testing conditions. The
   requirement to further improve the mechanical properties of this alloy
   drives our interest in the precipitation mechanism of the delta and eta
   phases found in this alloy. We report the presence of finely layered
   structures composed of two phases, delta and eta, with distinct
   structures and chemistries. Possible pathways to explain this
   precipitation in 718Plus are considered as follows: (i) the sequential
   formation of the delta from eta phase and (ii) the simultaneous
   precipitation of both eta and delta facilitated via solute rejection.
   Both can result in the formation of those small delta layers observed in
   HRSTEM. We discuss which is most likely by comparing the relative
   alignment of the phases by image processing and the analysis of the
   HRSTEM images, and propose formation mechanisms consistent with the
   distinctive dislocation structures observed at the interface.

   was detected in the cast and wrought conditions at temperature ranges of
   1000 to 1050 degrees C and 1000 to 1100 degrees C, respectively. More
   voids were seen at the fracture surface of the wrought specimens
   compared to the cast ones. At 950 degrees C, the formation of large and
   non-homogeneous voids at the fracture surface, as well as the appearance
   of transgranular and intergranular cracks in the wrought specimen,
   support moderate ductility of the alloy. Microstructural analysis does
   not support the occurrence of dynamic recrystallization in the cast
   specimens. In contrast, dynamic recrystallization in the wrought
   specimens at the region of maximum hot ductility promoted diffusion,
   leading to ductile fracture. At temperatures higher than the maximum
   ductility range, the formation of intergranular cracks resulted in a
   remarkable decline in ductility.

   Five nickel-base superalloys with various Ti and Nb contents were
   designed and produced by Vacuum Induction Melting furnace. The fiber
   laser beam welding operations were performed in constant heat input (100
   J mm(-2)) and different welding powers (400 and 1000W) and velocities
   (40 and 100 mm s(-1)) using 6-axis anthropomorphic robot. The macro- and
   micro-structural features, weld defects, chemical composition and
   mechanical property of 3.2 mm weldments were assessed utilizing optical
   and scanning electron microscopes equipped with EDS analysis and
   microhardness tester. The results showed that welding with higher powers
   can create higher penetration-to-width ratios. The porosity formation
   was increased when the welding powers and velocities were increased.
   None of the welds displayed hot solidification and liquation cracks in
   400 and 1000W welding powers, but liquation phenomenon was observed in
   all the beat-affected zones. With increasing the Nb content of the
   superalloys the liquation length was increased. The changing of the
   welding power and velocity did not alter the hardness property of the
   welds. The hardness of welds decreased when the Ti content declined in
   the composition of superalloys. Finally, the 400 and 1000W fiber laser
   powers with velocity of 40 and 100 m ms(-1) have been offered for hot

   rate range of 0.01-0.001 s(-1). The effects of initial delta phase
   (Ni3Nb) on the hot tensile deformation behaviors and fracture
   characteristics are discussed in detail. The results show that: (1) For
   the studied Ni-based superalloy with a large amount of delta phase, the
   flow stress curves are composed of three distinct stages, i.e., work
   hardening stage, flow softening stage and the final fracture stage. (2)
   The initial delta phase has significant effects on the deformation
   behaviors of the studied superalloy. delta phase can cause the obvious
   work hardening at the beginning of hot deformation, and then accelerates
   the flow softening by promoting the dynamic recrystallization with
   further straining. With the increase of initial delta phase, the strain
   rate sensitivity coefficient decreases firstly and then increases. (3)
   The combined effects of localized necking and microvoid coalescence
   cause the final fracture of specimens. The increase of initial delta
   phase increases the density of nucleus for the formation of microvoids,
   and promotes the nucleation and coalescence of microvoids. (C) 2014

   strengthening phase gamma' was transformed into e phase in the interior
   of the grains and more precipitated particles were formed in the grain
   boundary after aging heat treatment of the welded joint, resulting in
   bending of the grain boundary. Laves phase formed in the grain boundary
   is rich in Si and Nb elements, which helps to restrict grain growth. The
   second-phase particles generated at the bottom of dimples enhance the
   mechanical properties of the welded joint. Microhardness and strength of
   the welded joints can be significantly improved due to the occurrence of
   the precipitated phase in the grain boundary and interior of the grains.
   However, the occurrence of liquated GB can weaken binding between the
   grains, with the result that the heat affected zone becomes the weakest

   of carbide and delta phase at the prior particle boundaries or formation

AB Thermomechanical fatigue cyclic loading tests have been carried out
   along the <001> orientation and the formation of twins during
   thermomechanical fatigue processing has been studied in detail in a
   nickel-base single crystal TMS-82 superalloy. The twinning dislocation
   is determined to be 1/6<112> in the gamma' phase except for the 1/3<112>
   dislocation, which operates on every successive {111} plane. The
   1/6<112> twinning dislocations can move independently in both 7 and
   gamma' phases. Although movement of a single 1/6<112> twining
   dislocation may destroy the ordering of gamma' phase, its existence is
   rationalized on the basis of crystallographic analysis. The movement of
   a 1/3<112> dislocation on a single {111} plane will lead to a
   high-energy stacking sequence of head-to-head of two neighboring {111}
   layer atoms in the L1(2) structure. Pre-existing dislocations have a
   significant effect on the growth of deformation twins. In the
   dislocation-free area, the twin can propagate without any notable
   impediment to lead to a twin plate with equal width. High dislocation
   density may hinder the propagation of twins to varying degrees.

AB Ni-based superalloy represents a significant metal portion of the
   aircraft critical structural and engine components. When these critical
   structural components in aerospace industry are manufactured with the
   objective to reach high reliability levels and excellent service
   performance, surface integrity is one of the most relevant parameter
   used for evaluating the quality of finish machined surfaces. In the
   study of surface integrity, the formation white layer is a very
   important research topic. The formation of white layer on the Ni-based
   superalloy machined surface will reduce the machined parts service
   performance and fatigue life. This paper was conducted to determine the
   effects of cutting speed on white layer formation in high speed
   machining of FGH95 Ni-based superalloy. Optical microscope, scanning
   electron microscope and X-ray diffraction were employed to analyze the
   elements and microstructures of white layer and bulk materials. The
   statistical analysis for grain numbers was executed to study the
   influence of cutting speed on the grain refinement in the machined
   surface. The investigation results showed that white layer exhibits
   significantly different microstructures with the bulk materials. It
   shows densification, no obvious structural features characteristic. The
   microstructure and phase of Ni-based solid solution changed during
   cutting process. The increase of cutting speed causes the increase of
   white layer thickness when the cutting speed is less than 2000 m/min.
   However, white layer thickness reduces with the cutting speed further
   increase. The higher the cutting speed, the more serious grains
   refinement in machined surface. 2-D FEM for machining FGH95 were carried
   out to simulate the cutting process and obtained the cutting temperature
   field, cutting strain field and strain rate field. The impact mechanisms
   of cutting temperature, cutting strain and strain rates on white layer
   formation were analyzed. At last, deformation-phase transformation
   coupling mechanism was proposed to illustrate the white layer formation
   mechanism in high speed machining of PM superalloy. (C) 2013 Elsevier

   partitionings between gamma and gamma-prime phases, and high temperature
   XRD analysis has been performed to determine the lattice misfit between
   gamma and gamma-prime phases. Experimental results indicate that KC-5
   exhibits large lattice misfit toward negative; this has led to early
   formation of raft and dramatically decrease the creep strain rate. Si
   partitions toward gamma phase and promotes the formation of continuous

   there are debits associated with reduction in heat treatment window and

   alloying elements at the free surface has been determined. For this
   purpose, LSHR superalloy samples were exposed at 1408 K (1135 degrees C)
   for 0.25 to 4 hours in a vacuum or air furnace. Samples heat treated in
   the air furnace were either bare or enclosed in quartz capsules that had
   been evacuated or backfilled with argon. Following heat treatment, the
   alloy composition as a function of depth below the surface was
   determined by wavelength dispersive spectroscopy. Samples that had been
   heat treated in the vacuum furnace exhibited significant depletion of
   only chromium, a behavior explained on the basis of its high activity in
   nickel solid solution and corresponding rapid rate of evaporation. By
   contrast, samples heat treated in air exhibited an irregular scale at
   the surface and an underlying grain-coarsened, gamma-prime-depleted
   metal layer lean in aluminum, titanium, and chromium. A yet different
   behavior characterized primarily by aluminum loss at the surface was
   noted for samples that had been heat treated in evacuated or
   argon-backfilled capsules. These observations were interpreted in the
   context of a reaction between the quartz capsule and the aluminum
   evaporant. (C) The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society and ASM

   for 1-h cycles. 10 mu L water drops were put down onto the surface of
   the samples during the cold stages to study the influence of water onto
   the mechanical integrity of the pre-oxidized system. The multi-cracked
   ceria microstructure exhibited a widening of the cracks as well as
   refinement of the oxide grains. However, no spallation was observed and
   the composition remained stable for both ceria and alumina. It was
   demonstrated that the crystallization of ceria into the CeO2 fluorite

   with cylindrical axes deviating from the build direction by 0 degrees,

   angles of 0 degrees, 45 degrees, 55 degrees and 90 degrees were near [0

   = Cr, Mo or Si) were observed to align along the build direction with
   intervals of around 3 mu m. The phase was completely transformed into a
   single epsilon-hexagonal close-packed (hcp) phase after aging treatment
   at 800 degrees C for 24 h, when lamellar colonies of M2N precipitates
   and the epsilon-hcp phase appeared in the matrix. Among the samples, the

AB The objective of this work is to understand the influences of different
   chemical compositions of iron-based and nickel-based substrates on the
   TGO growth rate, the distribution of residual stress in TGO, the
   Quantity of the Spinel Cap Presence (QSCP) at the convex of undulated
   TGO, as well as the theta-Al2O3 to alpha-Al2O3 phase transformation. A
   thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) system consisting of the NiCrAlY bond
   coat and the 8YSZ topcoat (500 mu m thickness) were successfully
   produced onto the substrates of nickel-based superalloy and iron-based
   alloy by atmospheric plasma spraying (APS), respectively. The results
   suggest that, compared with the iron-based substrate, both the TGO
   growth rate and the aluminum depletion in the bond coat with the
   nickel-based substrate develop significantly slower as the thermal
   exposure proceeds. It is proposed that the Cr3+ and Al3+ with small
   radii may considerably influence the mechanisms of phase transformation
   in the TGO, and these small ions can promote the theta-Al2O3 to
   alpha-Al2O3 phase transformation. Furthermore, the TBCs system with
   iron-based substrate was prone to have much shorter stage of theta-Al2O3
   to alpha-Al2O3 phase transformation and a dramatic reduction of
   theta-Al2O3 content in the TGO, which had indirect effect on the
   thermo-dynamic behavior of TGO during the subsequent stage of isothermal
   oxidation. Furthermore, the apex of the convex of undulated TGO usually
   has the largest compressive residual stress. The spinel oxides can be
   inclined to form at the apex region of the convex of the undulated TGO
   with a lower value of b/a geometric parameter. However, only few spinel
   oxides appeared at the flank region of the convex. Nevertheless, the
   'spinel cap' feature usually formed at the area of the apex and the
   flank of the convex of undulated TGO with a higher value of b/a
   geometric parameter. Compared with the nickel-based substrate, the more
   presence of 'spinel cap' at the area of the convex of undulated TGO with
   a iron-based substrate can be found at the convex of undulated TGO, and
   its earlier end of the theta-Al2O3 to alpha-Al2O3 phase transformation
   may result in the lower value of compressive residual stress in average.

AB Powder of a nickel-based superalloy, RR1000, has been hot isostatically
   pressed (HIPped) at a supersolvus temperature and post-HIP heat treated
   to produce different microstructures. Microstructures were investigated
   using a scanning electron microscope together with an energy dispersive
   X-ray spectrometer and a wave-length dispersive X-ray spectrometer. High
   cycle four-point bending fatigue and tension-tension fatigue tests have
   been performed on the fabricated samples. It was found that HIPped and
   aged samples showed the best four-point bending fatigue limit while
   HIPped and solution-treated and aged samples had the lowest fatigue
   limit. The four-point bending fatigue crack initiations all occurred
   from the sample surfaces either at the sites of inclusion clusters or by
   cleavage through large grains on the surfaces. The tension-tension
   fatigue crack initiation occurred mainly due to large hafnia inclusion
   clusters, with lower fatigue lives for samples where inclusions were
   closer to the surface. Crack initiation at the compact Al2O3 inclusion
   cluster led to a much higher fatigue life than found when cracks were
   initiated by large hafnia inclusion clusters. The tension-tension
   fatigue limits were shown to decrease with increased testing temperature
   (from room temperature to 700 degrees C).

   are developed to optimize the hot working processing. The

   correlate with the processing maps. It can be found that the flow stress
   is sensitive to the forming temperature and strain rate. With the
   increase of forming temperature or the decrease of strain rate, the flow
   stress significantly decreases. The changes of instability domains may
   be related to the adiabatic shear bands and the evolution of 6
   phase(Ni3Nb) during the hot formation. Three optimum hot deformation
   domains for different forming processes (ingot cogging, conventional die
   forging and isothermal die forging) are identified, which are validated
   by the microstructural features and adiabatic shear bands. The optimum
   window for the ingot cogging processing is identified as the temperature

AB Hot cracking in the heat-affected zone (HAZ) of precipitation
   strengthened nickel-base superalloys, such as IN 738, during fusion
   welding remains a major factor limiting reparability of nickel-base gas
   turbine components. The problem of HAZ intergranular cracking can be
   addressed by modifying the microstructure of the pre-weld material
   through thermal treatment, which requires significant understanding of
   the critical factors controlling cracking behaviour. The decomposition
   of Mo-Cr-W- and Cr-rich borides in the alloy, among other factors, has
   been observed to contribute significantly to non-equilibrium
   intergranular liquation and, hence, intergranular liquation cracking
   during welding. Gleeble physical simulation of HAZ microstructure has
   also shown that non-equilibrium liquation is more severe in the vicinity
   of decomposed borides in the alloy and can occur at temperatures as low
   as 1,150 degrees C. Although currently existing pre-weld heat treatments
   for IN 738 superalloy minimize the contributions of dissolution of
   second phases, including borides, to HAZ intergranular liquation, these
   heat treatments are not industrially feasible due to process-related
   difficulties. Therefore, a new industrially feasible and effective
   pre-weld thermal treatment process, designated as FUMT, was developed
   during the present research by controlling both the formation of borides
   and the segregation of boron at the grain boundaries in the pre-weld
   heat-treated material. This thermal treatment was observed to very
   significantly reduce intergranular HAZ cracking in welded IN 738
   superalloy. The details of the development process and developed
   procedure are presented in this paper.

AB The grain size evolution of cold-rolled L-605 cobalt-base superalloy
   during ultra-rapid annealing is investigated in this paper. Cold-worked
   specimens undergo static recrystallization, leading to grain refinement
   or grain coarsening depending on the annealing time and temperature. The
   kinetics of grain growth is found to be independent of the initial
   deformation. The evolution of grain size can be simply described by a
   grain growth model for high temperatures and long annealing times, and
   the mobility of interfaces is estimated by modelling. Fast annealing
   treatment process is a very promising technique to customize grain size
   and enhance mechanical strength. In particular, the reduction of
   annealing time is an efficient method to produce a refined
   microstructure through static recrystallization.

AB The time required to ensure completion of the isothermal solidification
   process is the key in obtaining an intermetallic free and robust joint
   after diffusion brazing. In view of economic considerations, it is
   interesting to perform bonding process trials using standard heat
   treatment cycles. This paper addresses the effect of applying the
   standard heat treatment cycle including homogenisation, solution and
   double aging treatments on the microstructural and mechanical response
   of diffusion brazed IN718. A commercial Ni-7Cr-4.5Si-3.2B-3Fe (wt-%)
   brazing alloy was used as the interlayer. Results showed that bonds made
   with the standard homogenisation treatment, at 1100 degrees C, exhibited
   a eutectic free joint centreline. After applying the standard solution
   and double aging treatment, a bond with a joint efficiency of 82%
   relative to base metal was obtained in terms of shear strength. Room
   temperature tensile properties and stress rupture properties of the
   diffusion brazed joint were better than the minimum requirement of the
   AMS5383 acceptance standard.

AB Laser surface treatment of Rene 41 high-performance alloy is carried out
   with the presence of hard particles at the surface. B4C and SiC
   particles are uniformly distributed within 40 mu m carbon film at the
   workpiece surface prior to laser treatment process. The effect of hard
   particles on residual stress and microhardness variations is
   investigated at the treated surface. Morphological and metallurgical
   changes in the treated layer are examined by using electron microscopy,
   energy dispersive spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction. Residual stress
   formed at the surface is determined from the X-ray data. It is found
   that the treated surface is free from asperities such as large size
   voids and cracks. A dense layer is formed in the surface region, which
   causes volume shrinkage while contributing to microhardness and residual
   stress enhancement at the surface. B4C hard particles result in the
   highest residual stress and microhardness at the surface, which is
   attributed to its high thermal expansion coefficient. Copyright (c) 2013

AB The effect of post-weld heat treatments on the microstructure and
   mechanical properties of friction welded joints of alloy 718 was studied
   in the present work. Alloy 718 rods were friction welded with two prior
   heat treatments - solution treatment and solution treatment and aging.
   Solution treatment was done at 995 degrees C for 1 h. Aging was done at
   720 degrees C for 8 h followed by furnace cooling to 620 degrees C and
   holding at 620 degrees C for 8 h followed by air cooling. After friction
   welding, the joint samples were subjected to two types of post-weld heat
   treatments - direct aging (aging after welding, the same aging treatment
   mentioned above) and solution treatment and aging. Electron back
   scattered diffraction technique and transmission electron microscopy
   were used to study the development of microstructure. Hardness and
   tensile properties of the weld joints were evaluated. In the as-welded
   condition, samples welded with prior solution treatment and aging
   condition exhibited lower hardness at the weld zone and inferior tensile
   properties compared to the base material due to the dissolution of
   strengthening precipitates in the weld zone. On the other hand,
   formation of fine grains due to dynamic recrystallization led to higher
   hardness at the weld zone compared to the base material welded with
   prior solution treatment condition. Solution treatment and aging
   post-weld heat treatment resulted in an abnormal grain growth in the
   weld zone and thermomechanically affected zone. Owing to the formation
   of strengthening precipitates, solution treatment and aging post-weld
   heat treatment resulted in a significant increase in tensile strength of
   joint samples compared to that of as-welded friction weld joints.
   However, solution treatment and aging post-weld heat treatment done on
   friction weld joint samples with prior solution treatment or solution
   treatment and aging heat treatment condition resulted in inferior
   tensile properties compared to those of samples subjected to direct
   aging post-weld heat treatment. This may be attributed to grain
   coarsening that occurred during the post-weld solution treatment.
   Therefore, direct aging after welding is the recommended post-weld heat
   treatment for friction welded alloy 718 joints as compared to solution
   treatment and aging after welding. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB Nickel-based superalloys, such as Inconel 939, are a long-established
   construction material for high-temperature applications and profound
   knowledge of the mechanical properties for this alloy produced by
   conventional techniques exists. However, many applications demand for
   highly complex geometries, e.g. in order to optimize the cooling
   capability of thermally loaded parts. Thus, additive manufacturing (AM)
   techniques have recently attracted substantial interest as they provide
   for an increased freedom of design. However, the microstructural
   features after AM processing are different from those after conventional
   processing. Thus, further research is vital for understanding the
   microstructure-processing relationship and its impact on the resulting
   mechanical properties. The aim of the present study was to investigate
   Inconel 939 processed by selective laser melting (SLM) and to reveal the
   differences to the conventional cast alloy. Thorough examinations were
   conducted using electron backscatter diffraction, transmission electron
   microscopy, optical microscopy and mechanical testing.
   It is demonstrated that the microstructure of the SLM-material is highly
   influenced by the heat flux during layer-wise manufacturing and
   consequently anisotropic microstructural features prevail. An epitaxial
   grain growth accounts for strong bonding between the single layers
   resulting in good mechanical properties already in the as-built
   condition. A heat treatment following SLM leads to microstructural
   features different to those obtained after the same heat treatment of
   the cast alloy. Still, the mechanical performance of the latter is met
   underlining the potential of this technique for producing complex parts
   for high temperature applications. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Microstructural changes following oxidation at high temperatures of a

   This paper investigates possible solutions that can accurately model
   alloy microstructures that result from such a process in a cobalt-rich
   CoNiCrAIReY bond coat alloy system. Four different alloys with varying
   aluminum content were studied after heat treatments at 1000 degrees C or
   1150 degrees C. SEM, EPMA and XRD were used to characterize the alloy
   microstructure, and hardness testing was performed to determine the role
   of microstructure on mechanical properties. Experimental microstructures
   were modeled using two databases of Thermo-Calc, namely TTNI8 and SSOL5.
   Effects of Al content on phase changes and materials properties were
   quantitatively investigated. Data showed that a 1 wt. % increase of Al
   in the alloy caused an 8% increase in the beta phase, and a Cr and Re
   rich sigma phase precipitated preferentially at high Al concentrations.
   In addition, alloy hardness was found to increase by 4 and 81%,
   respectively, with a 10% increase in the beta and sigma phases. Modeled
   results using the TTNI8 database showed excellent agreement with
   experimental observations, but the SSOL5 database produced erroneous
   information. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This work examines the influence of microstructures on the fatigue
   failure behavior of the typical superalloys, GH864 and FGH96. A series
   of heat treatments were carried out to vary the grain size, the
   precipitation of carbide, and the gamma' phase. The fatigue failure
   behavior at 650 degrees C is demonstrated by crack growth tests, both
   allowing a 90 s dwell time and omitting any dwell time. Results from the
   as-received materials reveal four periods in the whole failure process:
   incubation, initiation, propagation, and instant fracture. The
   resistance of each period can be evaluated according to its proportion
   of the whole fatigue failure process. The alloy GH864, for example,
   shows an intersection of crack initiation and propagation when the
   solution temperature is around 1046 degrees C or the carbide continuous
   coefficient (f(c)) is close to 0.56. An optimum point should exist where
   the strengthening effects of grain size and carbide precipitation
   achieve perfect matching for a normal alloy. The smaller sizes of
   secondary gamma' (gamma(II)') and tertiary gamma' (gamma(III)') phases
   do present better crack growth resistance in their fatigue tests
   conducted without dwell time. The superior crack growth resistance of
   butterfly-shaped gamma(II)', as compared to octagonally shaped
   gamma(II)', indicates the influence of morphology on crack growth
   behavior. Moreover, the comprehensive parameter sigma(s)/(1-psi) offers
   a helpful evaluation tool for determining crack growth resistance; its
   application is confirmed by experiments. All of these results produce
   not only a method for evaluating the life of engineering metals, but
   also provide a standard for designing highly damage-tolerant
   superalloys. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   the temperature range of 950-1200 degrees C and a strain rate range of
   0.01-1 s(-1) was constructed. The true stress-true strain curves showed
   that the maximum flow stress decreases with the increase of temperature
   and decrease of strain rate. The developed processing map based on
   experimental data, showed variations of efficiency of power dissipation
   relating to temperature and strain rate at constant strain.
   Interpretation of the processing map showed one stable domain, in which
   dynamic recrystallization was the dominant microstructural phenomenon,
   and one instability domain with flow localization. The results of
   interpretation of flow stress curves and processing map were verified by
   the microstructure observations. There are two optimum conditions for
   hot working of this alloy with efficiency peak of 0.36: the first is at
   1150 degrees C for a strain rate of 1 s(-1) that produces a fine grained
   microstructure. The second is at 1200 degrees C for a strain rate of
   0.01 s(-1) that produces a coarse grained microstructure.

AB Slurry aluminide coatings are widely applied to protect metallic
   surfaces from oxidation and corrosion. They are frequently used in gas
   turbine engine nozzles because of economical advantages and a
   straight-forward manufacturing route. A variety of commercial slurries
   are available to aluminize the surfaces of nickel-based superalloys,
   however, they have two main disadvantages. First, the phosphates and
   chromates or halides used as binders and to activate the diffusion
   species are environmentally harmful; second, the conventional systems
   have to be heat-treated in an inert atmosphere. As an outcome of the
   PARTICOAT project the variety of slurry derived coatings has been
   extended by tailoring the particle size of the metallic source. By doing
   that, environmentally friendly water-based slurries were developed to
   produce in a one-step process und atmospheric conditions, a thermal
   barrier system based on an aluminum diffusion layer and an alumina foam
   layer which serves as bond coat as well as top coat (TC). CM 247 nickel
   base superalloy was coated and heat-treated in air using newly developed
   Al and Al-Si slurries. The oxidation behavior was investigated at 1,000
   A degrees C and then compared to pack-cemented aluminide coatings. The
   sulphidation behavior was investigated at 1,000 A degrees C in an
   atmosphere of 1.5 vol% SO2 in synthetic air for Al and Al-Si slurry
   coated samples with and without the alumina foam TC layer. PARTICOAT
   Al-based slurries,, after the initial stabilization of the TC, showed
   similar oxidation kinetics as pack cemented aluminides when exposed to
   air. When the coatings were exposed to sulphide-containing atmospheres,
   their oxidation rates increased, producing typical type I corrosion
   damage. Coatings without TC produced more protective oxide scales. The
   weight gain and coating area affected by corrosion were slightly lower
   for the Al-based slurries after 1,000 h of exposure than for the Al-Si
   based ones. The new coating presented here offers unique advantages in
   comparison to state-of-the-art slurry and pack cemented coatings by
   opening a potential way to manufacture a complete thermal barrier
   coating system by a simple, inexpensive and environmentally safe
   deposition and heat-treatment in air.

AB Published data on the coarsening behavior of gamma' precipitates in
   three ternary Ni-Al-Cr alloys are examined in light of the theory of
   trans-interface-diffusion-controlled (TIDC) coarsening, in which the
   kinetics is controlled by diffusion through the coherent
   precipitate-matrix interface. The experimental data are independent of
   the equilibrium gamma' volume fraction, as expected for TIDC coarsening.
   Kinetics of the type < r >(n) proportional to t for the growth of
   precipitates of average radius < r >, and X-infinity Al and X-infinity
   Cr proportional to t(-1/n) for the variations of the far-field matrix
   solute concentrations, X-infinity Al,X-Cr, with aging time, t, are
   characteristic of TIDC coarsening. The temporal exponent n approximate
   to 2.4 was obtained from the fitting of published particle size
   distributions. Based on correlation coefficients, the dependencies of <
   r >(n) on t and X-infinity Al,X-Cr on t(-1/n) were comparable for n =
   2.4 and n = 3 (the temporal exponent for matrix-diffusion-controlled
   coarsening). The dependencies of volume fraction, f, and number density,
   N-nu, on t are also compared with theoretical predictions. Using a
   thermodynamic model of the Ni-Al-Cr phase diagram, the interfacial free
   energy, sigma, was estimated from analysis of the data; sigma varies
   from similar to 14.5 to 19 mJ m(-2) in the three alloys. Interfacial
   diffusion coefficients, also obtained from analysis of the data, are
   greater than those in the gamma' phase but smaller than those in the
   gamma phase, which is consistent with the demands of the TIDC theory.
   Comparisons with the results from previously published work are noted
   and all discrepancies are discussed. (C) 2013 Acta Materialia Inc.

   Microstructures were investigated using a scanning electron microscope
   (SEM). Tensile testing was performed at room temperature and 700 degrees
   C and the deformed samples were examined using SEM and transmission
   electron microscope (TEM). It was found that in the as-HIPed condition
   the microstructure consisted of coarse and irregular-shaped primary and
   secondary gamma' together with a low volume fraction of fine gamma' (<50
   nm in diameter). Solution treatment below the gamma' solvus followed by
   air cooling resulted in the formation of finer cuboidal secondary gamma'
   (350-750 nm) and medium-sized spherical tertiary gamma' (100-200 nm).
   This led to an improvement of both the 0.2% yield strength and ultimate
   tensile strength. Ageing of the solution-treated or of the as-HIPed
   samples at 760 degrees C resulted in the precipitation of a high
   population of fine gamma' (around 50 nm) which further increased the
   strength. Within the resolution limit of the current TEM analysis,
   deformation at room temperature seemed to occur mainly by dislocations
   cutting through secondary gamma' and very fine gamma', accompanied by
   the formation of stacking faults within these precipitates; most of the
   medium-sized tertiary gamma' precipitates in solution-treated and aged
   samples were not cut through but were surrounded by dislocations.
   Deformation at 700 degrees C happened by dislocations cutting through
   gamma' precipitates and c matrix, leading to the formation of extended
   stacking faults across both c and gamma'. It is suggested that the
   optimum treatment of the current powder superalloy is to solution-treat
   and age after HIPing; this results in properties which are comparable
   with those of thermomechanically processed samples. Crown Copyright (c)

AB Disparity in hot ductility of a gamma' precipitation strengthened
   nickel-base superalloy, IN 738 LC, subjected to non-equilibrium heating
   and compressive and tensile stresses, was investigated. The alloy, which
   shows considerable hot ductility at temperatures ranging from 1160
   degrees C to 1250 degrees C under compressive loading, exhibits zero
   ductility under tensile loading within this temperature range. The
   difference is attributed to the fact that while compressive loading
   permits plastic deformation in spite of non-equilibrium liquid phase
   dissolution of gamma' precipitates in the alloy, the occurrence of the
   liquation reaction results in inhibition of plastic deformation under
   tensile loading. Accordingly, while grain refinement through
   strain-induced dynamic recrystallization occurred under compressive
   loading, within the same temperature range, the formation of new grains
   was prevented under tensile loading. This behavior is crucial during
   high temperature processing of gamma precipitation strengthened
   nickel-base superalloys. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study concerns with the determination of optimum production
   parameters for injection molding 718 superalloy parts. And at the same
   time, microstructural and mechanical characterization of these produced
   parts was also carried out. At the initial stage, 718 superalloy powders
   were mixed with a multi-component binder system for preparing feedstock.
   Then the prepared feedstock was granulated and shaped by injection
   molding. Following this operation, the shaped samples were subjected to
   the debinding process. These samples were sintered at different
   temperatures for various times. Samples sintered under the condition
   that gave way to the highest relative density (3 h at 1290 degrees C)
   were solution treated and aged respectively. Sintered, solution treated
   and aged samples were separately subjected to microstructural and
   mechanical characterization. Microstructural characterization operations
   such as X-ray diffraction, optical microscope (OM), scanning electron
   microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM) and elemental
   analysis showed that using polymeric binder system led to plentiful
   carbide precipitates to be occurred in the injection molded samples. It
   is also observed that the volume fractions of the intermetallic phases
   (gamma' and gamma '') obtained by aging treatment were decreased due to
   the plentiful carbide precipitation in the samples. Mechanical
   characterization was performed by hardness measurements and tensile
   tests. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Carbon has recently been reintroduced to single crystal (SX) superalloys
   because of its beneficial effects, such as reducing the occurrence of
   casting defects and enhancing the tolerance of low angle grain
   boundaries. Meanwhile, the addition of carbon leads to changes in the
   carbide morphology and volume fraction and may subsequently affect the
   recrystallization (RX) behavior. The purpose of this paper was to
   identify the effect of the carbon content on RX in an SX nickel-based
   superalloy. The SX specimens were prepared with an identical crystal
   orientation but different carbon contents. It was found that with the
   increase of the carbon content from 0.012 wt% to 0.17 wt%, the volume
   fraction of carbides increased linearly, while the average size of the
   carbides was nearly unchanged. After shot peening and heat treatment, a
   layer of RX grains was generated on the surface. As the carbon content
   was increased, the RX depth increased at first and later decreased.
   These changes were interpreted as the combined effect of the carbides on
   the stored energy during deformation and the pinning force during RX
   grain growth. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB By the measurement of creep property and microstructure observation, the
   influence of different processing technologies and different heat
   treatments on the creep property of GH4169 superalloy has been
   investigated. It was found that the processing technologies of GH4169
   superalloy can considerably affect the creep life. As compared to the
   hot continuous rolled alloy after standard heat treatment (abbreviated
   as HCR-ST), the radial forged alloy after the same treatment
   (abbreviated as RF-ST) precipitated more delta phase and led to shorter
   creep life. Besides, different heat treatments also resulted in
   different creep properties. Two specimens, both were taken from the hot
   continuous rolled alloy, were exposed to standard heat treatment (ST)
   and direct-aged treatment (DA), respectively. They are abbreviated as
   HCR-ST and HCR-DA. The results indicate that the HCR-DA specimen with
   clean grain boundaries and with no delta precipitates on them obtained
   much longer creep life. Without delta phase, the stress rupture life of
   the HCR-DA specimen is double of the RF-ST specimen whose amount of
   delta phase was largest. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB To evaluate the influence of reactive minor elements on oxidation
   resistance of a nickel-based superalloy, 0.5w/o Si, and/or 0.1w/o Y were
   added in various combinations to a quaternary powder metallurgy alloy
   that consisted of a ternary master alloy, Ni-12Cr-9Fez6w/o Al (w/o). The
   processing included production of transverse rupture strength (TRS) bars
   by uniaxial pressing followed by sintering to 1300 degrees C and Gleeble
   thermo-mechanical deformation to reduce porosity. Sectioned TRS bars
   were then oxidised (static) at 900 degrees C in air for times up to 1000
   h and the influence of the Si/Y additions on oxidation resistance was
   determined via a combination of weight gain data and microstructural
   examination. It was found that the addition of 0.5w/o Si to the
   quaternary Ni-Cr-Fe-Al powder metallurgy system provided a measureable
   improvement in oxidation resistance both in terms of thickness of oxide
   layer and in overall weight gain. Conversely, 0.1w/o Y provided little
   benefit when added with the Si and was shown to be detrimental in the
   absence of Si. Interestingly, little difference was noted in final
   microstructures. Specifically, variation in %gamma' between samples was
   minimal (58.3-61.7 v/o) and a distinct precipitate free zone was always
   present between the oxide and the gamma+gamma' matrix.

AB Optimization of transient liquid phase (TLP)-bonding variables is
   essential to achieve a joint free from deleterious intermetallic
   constituents and with appropriate mechanical properties. In this study,
   TLP bonding of IN-738LC superalloy was performed using AMS 4777 filler
   metal. The influence of gap size and bonding parameters (temperature and
   time) was investigated on the joint microstructure and its properties.
   In cases where the holding time was insufficient for complete isothermal
   solidification, the residual liquid transformed to non-equilibrium
   eutectic microconstituents consisting of nickel-rich boride,
   chromium-rich boride, and gamma solid solution phases. The eutectic
   width decreased with the increase of holding time and the increase in
   initial gap size resulted in thicker eutectic width in the samples
   bonded at the same temperature and for equivalent holding times. The
   time of complete isothermal solidification decreased with the increase
   in bonding temperature to 1100A degrees C, which was consistent with the
   models based on the diffusion-induced solid/liquid interface motion.
   Microhardness and shear strength tests were used to investigate the
   mechanical properties of the bonds. In the bonding condition in which
   isothermal solidification was not accomplished completely, the eutectic
   constituent with the highest hardness in the bond region was the
   preferential failure source. The results showed that homogenized joints
   had the highest shear strength. (C) The Minerals, Metals & Materials

PD OCT 2013
PY 2013
AB The test results undergoing thermomechanical fatigue of single crystal
   PWA1484 crack growth showed that the life of TMF specimens with notches
   (in this case laser drilled holes) is 4 times shorter than the number of
   cycles to failure observed on smooth gage section specimens (without
   holes) under the same loading conditions. Such a significant change in
   number of cycles to failure must be accounted in any damage tolerant
   turbine airfoil design system. The detailed fractographic analysis
   demonstrated that all cracks start crystallographically along the {111}
   octahedral crystallographic planes and later change to mixed mode
   fracture. Most of the crack propagation takes place at the low
   temperature portion of the cycle in the out-of-phase test; however there
   is noticeable damage accumulation during the high temperature
   compressive load portion of the cycle. Crack propagation under TMF
   loading conditions is considerably faster than corresponding isothermal
   LCF crack growth tested at the temperature and similar loading
   conditions of the tensile part of the TMF cycle. As results show, the
   applicability of the LEFM methods for single crystal TMF crack growth
   prediction is limited and at least should consist of mixed mode crack
   analysis.
   A new method for detecting cracks during a TMF test using induction
   thermography was employed. This method, coined the Active Inferred Crack
   Detection System (AICD), demonstrated high effectiveness in following
   crack progression under cyclic loading making it well suited to perform
   TMF crack growth testing. Using this experimental technique we also
   investigated the effect of secondary crystallographic orientation on
   crack propagation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   this paper is continue exploring a series of HIPing processes and
   various heat treatments for TO and T15 composite materials, and
   examining the effects on the microstructure and mechanical properties of
   TiC particles-strengthened cobalt-based alloy. The experimental results
   showed that the highest TRS value of 1566.7 MPa was obtained by the 15
   mass% TiC additive powders, which was sintered at 1280 degrees C for 1
   h, followed by HIP plus solid-solution heat treatment. The experiment
   proved that the closed pores can be effectively eliminated (1.34% ->
   0.69%) by HIP treatment. In addition, the more uniform precipitation of
   M6C carbides appeared in the grain-boundary and matrix after aging
   treatment. Moreover, the added amounts of TiC powder play an important
   role in improving the mechanical properties of cobalt-based alloy.

AB Alloy 617 is considered a leading structural material for next
   generation nuclear power plants due to its good corrosion resistance and
   exceptional strength at high-temperatures. In the present work, a
   complementary study of deformation mechanisms in Alloy 617 was performed
   via tensile testing at temperatures up to 1000 degrees C. Dynamic strain
   aging characterized by serrated flow leading to temperature independent
   yield strength was observed at intermediate temperatures. At
   temperatures higher than 700 degrees C, the material's strength reduced
   dramatically as a result of the predominance of dislocation creep and
   dynamic recrystallization. The changes in deformation mechanisms were
   established by direct observations of Electron Backscatter Diffraction
   mappings and by the analysis of texture development based on the pole
   figure mappings. Recrystallized grains were found to preferentially grow
   in particle-rich areas and on high-angle grain boundaries. Finally,
   fracture was initiated from particle cracks at temperatures up to 700
   degrees C and by triple junction cracks from 800 to 1000 degrees C.

   model the processing maps of X-750 superalloy at strain of 0.1, 0.3 and

   that the grain size as well as the volume fraction of the recrystallized
   grains increased at higher deformation temperature or lower strain rate.
   At strain of 0.5, the flow instability domain mainly located at lower
   temperature which is associated with shear band formation and flow
   localization. The optimum parameters for hot working of the alloy are
   deformation temperature of 1000-1050 degrees C and strain rate of 0.1-1

   reaction, being accompanied by the formation of MC carbide and M(C, B)
   carboboride. During the solidification, interdendritic region is
   significantly enriched with Nb, Ti, Zr, B, C and Mo, which results in
   the formation of carbide, carboboride and gamma/gamma' eutectic. The
   slow increase of solid fraction at the final stage of solidification is
   also caused by the strong segregation of the positive segregation
   elements in interdendritic area. In the case of K418, equilibrium model
   is shown to be a valuable tool to predict the solidification sequence

AB Despite the existence of previous studies on the heat treatment of the

   data that support the heat-treatment conditions that are proposed in

   solutioning and aging heat treatments. Thermodynamic calculations and
   differential thermal analysis guided the experimental design and the
   analysis of experimental results. The MAR-M247 superalloy was produced
   via vacuum induction melting and investment casting. The samples were
   solutioned between 1185 and 1270 A degrees C and aged between 770 and
   980 A degrees C. The as-cast and heat-treated samples were characterized
   using scanning electron microscopy in backscattered electron and
   secondary electron modes. Thermodynamic calculations have shown that the
   minimum solutioning temperature is approximately 1220 A degrees C,
   occurring in a gamma A + MC + MB2 three-phase field (M = metal). The
   samples were solutioned at 1250 A degrees C for 310 min before aging
   heat treatment. During solutioning the carbide composition is the MC
   phase shifts to higher hafnium (Hf) and lower tantalum (Ta) content,
   which is in agreement with the thermodynamics calculations. After
   solutioning, residual aluminum (Al) segregation leads to the formation
   of large gamma' particles in certain regions of the material following
   one-step aging heat treatment at 770 and 870 A degrees C. However, a
   nearly uniform size distribution of gamma' particles was observed after
   aging at 980 A degrees C as well as after double aging heat treatment at
   980 A degrees C for 300 min + 870 A degrees C for 1200 min.

   the temperature range from 300 degrees C to 500 degrees C. Normal DSA
   behavior was found at temperatures ranging from 300 degrees C to 350
   degrees C, while inverse DSA behavior was observed at temperatures
   ranging from 400 degrees C to 500 degrees C. The yield strength,
   ultimate tensile strength, elongation, work hardening index, and
   fracture features were not affected by temperature and strain rates in
   DSA regime. Negative strain-rate sensitivity of flow stress was observed
   in DSA regime. The analysis suggests that the ordering of the
   substitutional solutes around some defects like mobile dislocations and
   stacking faults due to the thermal activated process may cause the
   serrations on the tensile curves.

AB Inconel alloys (IN738) have found a wide range of applications in
   industries such as high-temperature resistance materials. Furthermore,
   different surface treatments and coatings have been developed for
   improving the properties of Inconel alloys. In this study, Al2O3 as a
   ceramic coating was deposited on the surface of the MCrAly as a ground
   coat layer on Ni-based super alloy, by cathodic plasma electrolytic
   deposition (CPED). The CPED process was carried out in Ethanol solution
   of Al (NO3)(3)center dot 9H(2)O (18 g/l). Several samples were obtained
   in different deposition conditions and analyzed using XRD, SEM and EDS.
   The XRD analysis shows the presence of Al2O3 and Ni3Al phases. Based on
   thermal expansion, this is in agreement with the composition of the
   MCrAlY used as bond coat. SEM micrograph showed changes in
   microstructure of specimen by varying the pH of the solution in
   different PH of solutions. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   degrees C, to explore its performance as turbine engine components under
   marine environment. Uncoated and different salt-coated samples (100 wt.%
   NaCl, 75 wt.% Na2SO4 + 25 wt.% NaCl, and 90 wt.% Na2SO4 + 5 wt.% NaCl +
   5 wt.% V2O5) were exposed in air at 550 and 650 A degrees C under cyclic
   heating and cooling for 100 h. Weight gain was studied for both uncoated
   and salt-coated samples. X-ray diffraction, scanning electron
   microscopy, and electron dispersive spectroscopy were used to
   characterize the oxidation and corrosion products. A possible mechanism
   of corrosion, based on the corrosion compounds, is discussed. The
   variation in weight gain with time showed a parabolic growth of oxides.
   Coating with NaCl was found to be detrimental both at 550 A degrees C as
   well as 650 A degrees C. On the other hand, the salt mixture of NaCl and
   Na2SO4 had no effect at 550 A degrees C; however, it was detrimental at
   higher temperature of 650 A degrees C. Coatings of salt mixture of
   Na2SO4, NaCl, and V2O5 caused very slow oxidation at both the
   temperatures. Increase in thickness of salt coating was observed to
   enhance the rate of hot corrosion. Among the three types of salt
   coatings, the coating of NaCl was found to be most damaging both at 550
   and 650 A degrees C.

AB A substantial undercooling up to 250 K was produced in the IN718
   superalloy melt by employing the method of molten salt denucleating, and
   the microstructure evolution with undercooling was investigated. Within
   the achieved undercooling, 0-250 K, the solidification microstructure of
   IN718 undergoes two grain refinements: the first grain refinement occurs
   in a lower range of undercooling, which results from the ripening and
   remelting of the primary dendrite, and at a larger range of
   undercooling, grain refinement attributes to solidification shrinkage
   stress and lattice distortion energy originating from the rapid
   solidification process. A 'lamellar eutectic anomalous eutectic'
   transition was observed when undercooling exceeds a critical value of
   similar to 250 K. When undercooling is small, owing to niobium
   enrichment in interdendrite, the remaining liquid solidifies as eutectic
   (gamma + Laves phase); whereas, if the undercooling achieves 250 K, the
   interdendrite transforms from eutectic (gamma + Laves phase) to Laves
   phase, which results from the formation of divorced eutectic arising
   from the huge variance of the growth velocities of gamma and Laves
   phases.

   investigated using SEM equipped with energy disperse spectroscopy, and
   the precipitation phase was analysed using TEM after standard heat
   treatment. The results showed that the liquid nitrogen provided the clad

   ultrarapid cooled clad coating was refined, and Laves concentration and
   dendritic space were decreased compared with the air cooled clad
   coating. The ultrarapid cooling rate reduced the constitutional
   supercooling and restrained Nb segregation in the Laves during

   vacuum annealing at 900 and 1000 degrees C were analyzed using X-Ray
   diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM)
   and energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS). The effect of coating
   concentrations on the outward diffusion behavior of substrate elements
   was discussed. The high Cr concentrations in the Al-rich NiAl coatings
   were caused by the intense interdiffusion between Al and Cr. The Ti, W
   and Mo partitioned to gamma'-Ni3Al in the coatings. Several possible
   reasons for the formation of gamma'-Ni3Al at the surface of Ni-rich NiAl
   coating were identified, including: diffusion behavior of W and Mo in
   beta-NiAl, destabilizing effect of substrate elements on beta-NiAl, and
   diffusion rates of Ni and Al in beta-NiAl. The volume change in beta
   (sic) gamma' transformation process shows Ni uphill diffused to the

AB Plastic flow and microstructure evolution during sub- and supersolvus
   forging and subsequent supersolvus heat treatment of the
   powder-metallurgy superalloy LSHR (low-solvus, high-refractory) were
   investigated to develop an understanding of methods that can be used to
   obtain a moderately coarse gamma grain size under well-controlled
   conditions. To this end, isothermal, hot compression tests were
   conducted over broad ranges of temperature [(1144 K to 1450 K) 871 A
   degrees C to 1177 A degrees C] and constant true strain rate (0.0005 to
   10 s(-1)). At low temperatures, deformation was generally characterized
   by flow softening and dynamic recrystallization that led to a decrease
   in grain size. At high subsolvus temperatures and low strain rates,
   steady-state flow or flow hardening was observed. These latter behaviors
   were ascribed to superplastic deformation and microstructure evolution
   characterized by a constant grain size or concomitant dynamic grain
   growth, respectively. During supersolvus heat treatment following
   subsolvus deformation, increases in grain size whose magnitude was a
   function of the prior deformation conditions were noted. A transition in
   flow behavior from superplastic to nonsuperplastic and the development
   during forging at a high subsolvus temperature of a wide (possibly bi-
   or multimodal) gamma-grain-size distribution having some large grains
   led to a substantially coarser grain size during supersolvus annealing
   in comparison to that produced under all other forging conditions.

AB During this study, new Ni-base alloys precipitating cubic gamma' were
   developed which shall be used for the production of polycrystalline
   nanoporous membranes. The polycrystalline nanoporous membranes are
   produced through a combination of cold rolling and heat treatment in
   order to get directional coarsening of the gamma'-phase which is
   selectively dissolved afterwards. Conventional Ni-based superalloys have
   a gamma/gamma' -microstructure with cubic gamma'-precipitates and show
   the needed etching behaviour but their high strength and limited
   ductility at room temperature do not allow to produce the
   polycrystalline nanoporous membranes by means of the before mentioned
   method. Thus, the new alloys with simpler composition were developed
   which have a gamma/gamma' microstructure. The alloy Ni-13Fe-8Al-4Ti
   (composition in atomic percent) which was produced by Schmitz
   (Cullivier, ISBN 978-3-86955-523-2, 16) served as basis and showed the
   promising characteristics. To obtain cubic gamma'-precipitates, the
   misfit was estimated to values of at least |0.2| % by a method presented
   by Mishima (Acta Metall 33:1161-1169, 23). Further, the phase
   compositions as well as phase volume fractions of gamma-matrix and
   gamma'-phase were calculated by means of Thermocalc(A (R)) simulations
   (database: TTNi7). The etching behaviour of the new alloys was adjusted
   by adding chromium and molybdenum which passivate the gamma-matrix so
   that the gamma'-precipitates dissolve during the leaching process. The
   well-aligned cubic gamma'-precipitates were obtained by partially
   replacing titanium by niobium. Furthermore, the hardness could be
   significantly lowered compared to conventional superalloys by reduction
   of alloying elements. Hence, the promising alloys were found to get
   directional coarsening of the gamma'-precipitates in a combined process
   of cold rolling and heat treatment.

   obtained using three distinct methods, namely, measurement of a

   as a correction factor), and an axial stress balance. In addition, data
   obtained using the contour method have been included since it allows
   comparison of diffraction-based data to a technique that does not
   require a d(0) value. In terms of residual stress, agreement between all
   d(0) measurement techniques and the contour method was high, with the
   exception being those made using the sin(2)psi technique. An offset of
   approximately 350 MPa was observed in these data, and a possible
   systematic error was ascribed to a unique diffraction characteristic of
   a gamma/gamma' nickel-base superalloy. A global d(0) value obtained
   using a stress balance or stress-free cube was found to be reliable
   throughout the sample bulk in cases where thermal processing was carried

AB The microstructure-property relationship of deformed parts has been
   becoming very critical, especially for aerospace components. The design
   of manufacturing process to achieve the unique and required
   microstructure and property is thus critical. For turbine disc, fine
   microstructure is required for the bore region of the disc to provide
   high tension strength and fatigue resistance at low temperature (420-650
   degrees C). The coarse microstructure is also needed for its rim region
   to possess the excellent rupture life and crack growth resistance at
   high temperature (>760 degrees C). A unique heat treatment method was
   developed to produce the gradient microstructure from the bore to the
   rim regions. In this study, the gradient temperature heat treatment
   process (GTHT) was carried out on FGH 4096 superalloys under the
   conditions of (1080 degrees C-260 degrees C/30 min, AC) and (1140
   degrees C-300 degrees C/30 min, AC), and two
   structural-gradient-materials (SGMs) were obtained. The SGM produced by
   GTHT under the condition of (1080 degrees C-260 degrees C/30 min, AC)
   has gradient microstructure from the equiaxed grains to the flatted
   grains. In between the equiaxed and flatted microstructures, a unique
   transition region is found. The dual-size gradient material was thus
   successfully fabricated by the GTHT process under the condition of (1140
   degrees C-300 degrees C/30 min, AC). The grain size of coarse
   microstructure is approximately 40 mu m, while the grain size of fine
   microstructure is about 4 mu m. The microstructural mechanisms of the
   SGMs during hot working process are identified in this research.
   Furthermore, the developed dual-size gradient material has potential
   application in dual-property turbine disc. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

   of different characterization methods, including X-ray residual stress
   analysis, electron back-scattered diffraction, microhardness testing and
   focused ion beam secondary electron imaging, contributed to a detailed
   study of the shot-peened region. Thermal exposure at 700 degrees C
   resulted in a large reduction in the residual stresses and
   work-hardening effects in the alloy, but the subsurface remained in a
   beneficial compressive state. Oxidizing environments caused
   recrystallization in the near surface, but did not affect the residual
   stress-relaxation behaviour. Dwell-fatigue loading caused the residual
   stresses to return to approximately zero at nearly all depths. This work
   forms part of an ongoing investigation to determine the effects of
   shot-peening in this alloy with the motivation to improve the fatigue
   and oxidation resistance at 700 degrees C. (C) 2013 Acta Materialia Inc.

   experiments were carried out at 1100 degrees C with different holding
   times using Ni-B-Si-Cr-Fe filler alloy, AMS 4776, with B and Si as the
   melting point depressant elements. It was found that insufficient
   isothermal solidification of liquated insert caused the formation of
   continuous centreline eutectic phases. The width of the eutectic
   decreased with the increase in holding time. Complete isothermal
   solidification, which precluded the formation of the centreline
   eutectic, occurred within 45 min of holding time. In addition to the
   centreline eutectic products, precipitation of boron rich particles was
   observed at the diffusion affected zone. Homogenisation of isothermally
   solidified joints at 1120 degrees C for 300 min resulted in the
   elimination of intermetallic phases formed at the diffusion affected
   zone and formation of significant gamma' precipitates in the joint
   region.

   K, 1323 K, 1373 K, and 1423 K (1000 A degrees C, 1050 A degrees C, 1100
   A degrees C, and 1150 A degrees C) at strain rates of 0.001, 0.01, 0.1,
   and 1 s(-1) up to a true strain of 0.8. Then variations in stress-strain
   curves as well as changes in microstructures of various hot-deformed
   samples were studied. At 1273 K to 1323 K (1000 A degrees C to 1050 A
   degrees C), dynamic recovery (DRV), and at 1373 K to 1423 K (1100 A
   degrees C to 1150 A degrees C), dynamic recrystallization (DRX), were
   recognized to be the main mechanisms of the alloy softening during hot
   compression tests. The relationships between flow stress, strain rate,
   and temperature were mathematically modeled with three well-known
   equations, and on the basis of those equations, the activation energy of
   hot deformation was calculated. For improvement of the proposed models,
   it was necessary to conduct the investigation at two temperature ranges:
   1373 K to 1423 K (1100 A degrees C to 1150 A degrees C), in which DRX
   occurred, and 1273 K to 1323 K (1000 A degrees C to 1050 A degrees C),
   where DRV as well as gamma' precipitation happened. For each of the
   temperature ranges, a different value for activation energy was
   obtained, which in conjunction with the related model, can be used for
   simulating the deformation behavior of the alloy.

   coating and (ii) duplex-coating consisting of the same MCrAlY coating
   and a NiAl-topcoat was studied.
   The MCrAlY coating did not cause significant changes in failure
   behaviour and TMF life of the superalloy, whereas duplex coating reduced
   TMF life significantly because of accelerated fatigue crack initiation
   and propagation into the substrate material. Due to much lower fracture
   strains of the duplex coating than of MCrAlY coating the crack formation
   in the duplex coatings was already observed at very early stages of
   lifetime. Furthermore, crack propagation was found to be significantly
   affected by crack branching at the interface between coating and

AB The hot deformation behavior of nickel-based superalloy 740H has been
   investigated by hot compression experiments. The tests were carried out
   in the temperature range of 1050-1200 degrees C with strain rates of
   0.1-20 s(-1) to a total strain of 0.6. True stress-true strain curves
   and deformation microstructures were studied. The results show that
   dynamic recrystallization, which is the principal softening mechanism in
   the hot working of 740H, determines the shape of flow curves. The
   fraction of DRX grains at the strain of 0.6 is increased by deformation
   temperature while at a particular temperature, it is lower at strain
   rate of 1 s(-1) than at other strain rates. A hyperbolic-sine type
   equation has been established between peak stress and deformation
   conditions through Z parameter, giving activation energy value of 357.3
   kJ/mol. The hot working windows of alloy 740H was briefly discussed
   using the processing map. Temperature range of 1160-1200 degrees C with
   strain rate larger than 10 s(-1) is the probable domain for hot
   extrusion of 740H. Crown Copyright (c) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.

   of 1200 degrees C in a variety of atmospheres (oxidizing, inert,
   reducing) that, combined with in situ mechanical loading, can be used to
   mimic processing and operating conditions of engineering components. The
   loaded specimen is reoriented with respect to the incident beam of

AB Degradation of materials due to erosion-corrosion is encountered in a
   large variety of engineering industries including thermal power plants.
   In such environments, superalloys are used due to their excellent
   mechanical properties at high temperature. They often lack resistance to
   erosion-corrosion and to increase their life, protective coatings play
   an important role. In the present paper, the erosion-corrosion
   performance of plasma sprayed Ni-22Cr-10Al-1Y coating on four different
   superalloys (namely Superni 75, Superni 600, Superni 718 and Superfer
   800H) have been evaluated in actual industrial environment. The nickel
   and iron based superalloys and NiCrAlY coating on these superalloys have
   been investigated by exposing them to the low temperature primary
   superheater zone of the coal-fired thermal power plant at the
   temperature zone of 540 degrees C for 10 cycles of 100 h duration.
   Scanning electron microscope (SEM) attached with energy dispersive X-ray
   analyser (EDAX), X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and electron probe micro
   analysis (EPMA) were used to analyse the exposed products along the
   surface and cross-section. The erosion-corrosion resistance of the
   plasma sprayed coating on four different superalloys has been
   investigated. The probable mechanism of attack for this coating in the
   given boiler environment is discussed. Main phases identified in all the
   NiCrAlY coated superalloys after 1000 h of exposure to the coal fired
   boiler environment are Al(2)O(3) and Cr(2)O(3). Oxides of aluminium,
   chromium and yttrium are recognized as protective oxides for boiler

AB Cr is the most important element in nickel-based alloys to prevent high
   temperature oxidation and corrosion. However, high-Cr content will lead
   to a decline of hot workability which limits the addition of Cr for most
   nickel-based superalloys. In order to add more Cr into Ni-based alloy
   for improving high temperature oxidation and corrosion resistance, the
   poor hot workability of high-Cr alloy must be first solved. Deformation
   characteristic of a high-Cr nickel-based alloy (40 wt% Cr) under hot
   compression conditions at 800-1200 degrees C has been investigated by
   using a Gleeble 3500 machine, and the microstructural evolution during
   hot working process has been observed by optical microscopy and scanning
   electron microscopy. The results show that a high-temperature
   low-plasticity (HTLP) region exists in this high-Cr nickel-based alloy.
   This phenomenon can be attributed to its non-uniform interdendritic
   microstructure at high temperatures. These results can explain the poor
   hot workability of high-Cr nickel-based alloy.

   was precipitated in the form of gamma aEuro(3) during the 980STA heat

   solid-solution strengthening and the constituent element of Laves. The

   investigated. The superalloy substrates were first electropolished to
   get rid of the residual surface strain. Then, Pt was electrodeposited
   and vacuum annealing was conducted for some of the substrates, and
   aluminized and Pt-aluminized specimens were prepared using the
   conventional aluminizing process. It was found that in the aluminized
   specimens, voids were formed in the vicinity of the substrate/coating
   interfaces during thermal cyclic heating, whereas secondary diffusion
   zones (SDZ) were formed by isothermal heating. These different
   microstructural changes of the aluminized specimens can be explained by
   the kinetics of diffusion between the coating layer and the substrate
   during the heating/cooling processes. In the Pt-aluminized specimen, on
   the other hand, secondary reaction zone (SRZ) formation was observed
   after both thermal cyclic and isothermal treatments. These results can
   be explained by the polycrystallization of the substrate surface during
   the annealing process, which promotes interdiffusion, resulting in the
   formation of an SRZ.

   Alloy718 during hot forging were revealed through hot compression tests
   and quantitative relations among various parameters that were available
   for numerical calculation were derived. Dynamically recrystallized grain
   diameter depended on temperature, strain rate and was independent of
   initial grain diameter and strain. And the grain diameter was expressed
   as a function of the temperature compensated strain rate, i.e.,
   Zener-Hollomon parameter quantitatively. Avrami-type equation was
   available for comprehensive and quantitative expression of dynamic
   recrystallization transition tendency. And the fraction of dynamic
   recrystallization was a function of the given strain and the strain for
   50% recrystallization which depended on the initial grain diameter and

   based superalloy using nitrided hot work tool steel, glassed workpieces
   and graphite lubrication. The investigation was conducted through a
   combination of metallurgical analysis, metrology and finite element
   analysis. Out of the damage modes observed under these conditions, the
   plastic deformation of the substrate was found to be the cause for tool
   failure. This paper discusses the relationship between plastic
   deformation of the substrate and the formation of scoring marks, which
   fail the die. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V. All

AB MAR-M247 superalloy has excellent mechanical properties and good

   known as gamma' phase hardener in nickel-based superalloys, besides
   promoting homogeneous distribution of MC carbides. This work is inserted
   in a project that aims to evaluate the total replacement of tantalum by
   niobium atoms in MAR-M247 superalloy (10.2 Co, 10.2 W, 8.5Cr, 5.6 Al,

   balance-wt.%). Based on microstructural characterizations (SEM and
   FEG-SEM, both with EDS) of the as-cast material and heat-treated
   materials as well as utilizing Thermocalc simulations and experiments of
   differential thermal analysis (DTA), heat-treatment at 1260 degrees C
   for 8 h was chosen as an ideal condition for the solution of Nb-modified

   temperature range from the room temperature to 1,000 A degrees C in air.
   The linear coefficient of thermal expansion was evaluated for

   reaction films formed on the rubbing surfaces and their effects on the
   tribological properties of composites at different temperatures were
   addressed according to the surface characterization by SEM, XRD, and
   XPS. The results show that the NiCr-Al2O3 composite with addition of 10
   wt% SrSO4 and 10 wt% Ag exhibits satisfying friction and wear properties
   over the entire temperature range from room temperature to 1,000 A
   degrees C. The composition of the tribo-layers on the worn surfaces of
   the composites is varied at different temperatures. The synergistic
   lubricating effect of SrAl4O7, Ag, and NiCr2O4 lubricating films formed
   on worn surfaces were identified to reduce the friction coefficient and
   wear rate from room temperature to 800 A degrees C. Meanwhile, at 1,000
   A degrees C, the SrCrO4 and NiAl2O4 was formed on the worn surfaces
   during sliding process, combining with the NiCr2O4, Al2O3, Cr2O3, Ag,
   and Ag2O, which play an important role in the formation of a continuous

   investigated using five different soaking temperatures during HIP. The
   restoration of microstructural and material properties under these HIP
   schedules followed by the same rejuvenation heat treatment (RHT)

   played a dominant role in the cavity healing process, determining the
   evolution features of cavities and hence the extending ratio of rupture
   life. With gradually increasing the adopted HIP temperature, the cavity
   healing behaviors were revealed. Concentrically oriented N-type gamma'
   rafting structure in the vicinity of the healing cavity was observed at
   an appropriate soaking temperature. The driving force for the cavity
   healing was considered to be the chemical potential gradient induced by
   the stress gradient field around the cavity. The appropriate HIP
   schedule followed by RHT process significantly improved the rupture life
   of damaged alloy, and the extending ratio varied with the adopted HIP
   temperature.

AB Nickel-based superalloy is widely employed in aircraft engines and the
   hot end components of various types of gas turbines with its high
   strength, strong corrosion resistance and excellent thermal fatigue
   properties and thermal stability. However, nickel-based superalloy is
   one of the extremely difficult-to-cut materials. During the machining
   process, the interaction between the tool and the workpiece causes the
   severe plastic deformation in the local area of workpiece, and the
   intense friction at the tool-workpiece interface. The resulting cutting
   heat coupled with the serious work hardening leads to a series of flaws,
   such as excessive tool wear, frequent tool change, short tool life, low
   productivity, and large amount of power consumption etc., in which the
   excessive tool wear has become one of the main bottlenecks that
   constraints the machinability of nickel-based superalloys and its wide
   range of applications.
   In this article, attention is mainly focused on the tool wear
   characteristics in the machining of nickel-based superalloys, and the
   state of the art in the fields of failure mechanism, monitoring and
   prediction, and control of tool wear are reviewed. The survey of
   existing works has revealed several gaps in the aspects of tool
   self-organizing process based on the non-equilibrium thermodynamics,
   tool wear considering the tool nose radius, thermal diffusion layer in
   coated tools, tool life prediction based on the thermal-mechanical
   coupling, and industrial application of tool wear online monitoring
   devices. The review aims at providing an insight into the tool wear
   characteristics in the machining of nickel-based superalloys and shows
   the great potential for further investigations and innovation in the
   field of tool wear. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   Determination of optimum heat treatment conditions for sintered parts
   aimed to achieve maximum densities, and the microstructure and
   mechanical properties of the produced parts were characterised in
   sintered and heat treated conditions. Injection moulding feedstock was
   prepared by mixing Nimonic-90 powder with a multicomponent binder
   system. After moulding, the samples were subjected to a debinding
   process that consists of solvent and thermal steps. To determine the
   sintering temperatures, the debinded samples were subjected to
   differential scanning calorimetry analysis, and then they were sintered
   at various temperatures under high level vacuum. After sintering,
   density measurements and optical microscope examinations were performed.
   The highest density values were determined for the samples that were
   sintered at 1330 degrees C for 3 h. Different aging treatments were
   performed on the samples that achieved the highest sintered density, and
   the microstructures and mechanical properties were then characterised.
   It was determined that heat treatments had a beneficial effect on the
   mechanical properties of the material. Though the mechanical properties
   of the injection moulded materials produced were lower than the wrought
   Nimonic-90 materials, they have superior mechanical properties compared
   with cast Nimonic-90 alloys.

   basically due to the inward diffusion of aluminium, which demonstrated
   that a chemical potential gradient exists for the inward diffusion of

   results provided the evidence that the partition of interdiffusion zone

AB Gleeble thermomechanical simulation and microstrucutural analyses of
   laser beam weldability of a newly developed precipitation-hardened
   nickel-base HAYNES alloy 282 were performed to better understand the
   fundamental cause of heat-affected zone (HAZ) cracking and how to
   prevent the cracking problem in the material. Submicron size
   intergranular M5B3 particles are identified for the first time in the
   present work by transmission electron microscopy, and were found to be
   the primary cause of HAZ grain boundary liquation cracking in the alloy.
   Complete dissolution of the liquating M5B3 particles by preweld heat
   treatment exacerbated rather than reduced susceptibility to cracking,
   which could be attributed to nonequilibrium intergranular segregation of
   boron atoms, liberated by the complete dissolution of the boride
   particles, during cooling from heat treatment temperature. Consequently,
   to reduce the HAZ cracking, a preweld heat treatment that reduces the
   volume fraction of the M5B3 particles while minimizing nonequilibrium
   grain boundary boron segregation is necessary, and this is possible by
   heat treating the alloy at 1353 K to 1373 K (1080 A degrees C to 1100 A
   degrees C). Further improvement in cracking resistance to produce
   crack-free welds is achieved by subjecting the alloy to
   thermomechanically induced grain refinement coupled with the preweld
   heat treatment at 1353 K (1080 A degrees C). A Gleeble hot ductility
   test showed that formation of the crack-free welds is unexplainable by
   mere reduction in grain size without considering the effect of grain
   refinement on intergranular liquid produced by subsolidus liquation of
   the M5B3 borides.

AB The microstructure evolution and microsegregation behavior of alloying
   elements in a Ni-based superalloy at a series of growth rates under
   super-high thermal gradient directional solidification were
   quantitatively characterized. Both microstructure and dendritic
   segregation are functions of growth rate. The high growth rate
   solidification leads to refinement in primary (lambda(1)) and secondary
   (lambda(2)) dendrite arm, decreased size of gamma/gamma' eutectics and
   gamma' phase, as well as reduced microsegregation degree of alloying
   elements. Also with the growth rate increased, the morphology of gamma'
   precipitates changes from irregular shape to a cuboidal one. The
   electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) reveals that Cr, Mo and gamma'
   forming elements (Al, Ta and Nb) all partition to interdendritic region,
   while W and Re both preferably segregate to dendrite core. Thus at fast
   growth rates (or high cooling rates), finer dendrites, uniformly
   coherently cuboidal gamma' precipitates and decreased segregation
   favorable to the performance of superalloys are obtained. These
   quantitative results provide a basis for the establishment of cast and

   solution heat treatment of 1130 degrees C/2 h/water-quench followed by
   ageing at 1010 degrees C/2 h/air-cool and 788 degrees C/8 h/air-cool.
   Cyclic deformation characteristics of the Haynes 282 at room temperature
   (25 degrees C) were obtained from the LCF test. The LCF test results
   showed that Haynes 282 experienced a relatively short period of initial
   cyclic hardening followed by a regime of cyclic softening to specimen
   failure at all the strain amplitudes employed in the work. Additionally,
   cyclic deformation parameters determined in the work indicate strong
   fatigue deformation resistance of the newly developed superalloy. On the
   other hand, room temperature FCG test results showed that an increase in
   the stress ratio leads to a rise in the crack growth rate. However, in
   contrast to common assumption, the loading frequency was observed to
   have an effect on the crack growth behaviour at room temperature.
   Furthermore, an increase in temperature from 25 degrees C to 600 degrees
   C at a testing frequency of 15 Hz resulted in an increase in the fatigue
   crack growth at all stress intensities. However, at a frequency of 0.05
   Hz, over a relatively large stress intensity range (Delta K), the
   fatigue crack growth rate decreased with an increase in temperature. The
   effect of temperature on the fatigue crack growth rate of Haynes 282 are
   discussed in terms of homogeneity of slip, roughness induced crack
   closure and dynamic strain ageing. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   correlation Aramis (R) system indicated that there is a critical axial
   shortening value (2 mm) below which LFWed and post weld heat treated
   (PWHTed) Waspaloy exhibited weak integrity. At and above this critical
   shortening, the yield strength and ultimate tensile stress (UTS) values
   were more or less the same as for the parent material. However, total
   elongation continued to increase with axial shortening even above the
   critical value due to decrease in width of thermo-mechanically affected
   zone (TMAZ). The sample with the highest axial shortening (4.9 mm)
   exhibited an elongation 91% of the parent material elongation. According
   to Aramis (R) data, the mixture rule can be used reliably to determine
   the contribution of TMAZ to the tensile elongation of PWHTed Waspaloy.
   Microstructure characterization across the weld in the as-LFWed and
   PWHTed conditions was carried out to correlate the process parameters
   and microstructural changes that affect the tensile properties. Weak
   integrity at axial shortening below 2 mm was mainly due to lack of
   bonding and/or presence of oxides at the weld interface. In the
   as-welded condition, a loss in hardness was observed, and related to the
   extensive dissolution of strengthening phase (gamma') in the weld area.
   The applied PWHT restored the hardness in the weld region. (C) 2012

AB Grain refinement is the essential concern in producing Superalloy 718
   components. Thermomechanical process as a means of producing fine grain
   structure has attracted significant attention. However, hot forging with
   deviations on forging temperature results in significant changes in the
   microstructure. High volume fractions of delta phase thus produced
   reduce the amount of niobium available for) gamma" formation and
   consequently lower the strength. In this work, the combination of heavy
   plastic deformation with subsequent recrystallization was utilized as an
   effective method to achieve a fine-grained structure. Specimens in this
   process were first solution treated at high temperatures and then
   followed by plastic deformation. Subsequent recrystallization caused an
   immediate precipitation of a fine, uniformly dispersed delta phase from
   the niobium oversaturated matrix that prohibited grain growth. A
   fine-grained structure with grain sizes <1 mu m was obtained, smaller

AB Creep tests on Ni-based single-crystal superalloy sheet specimens
   typically show greater creep strain rates and/or reduced strain or time
   to creep rupture for thinner specimens than predicted by current
   theories, which predict a size-independent creep strain rate and creep
   rupture strain. This size-dependent creep response is termed the
   thickness debit effect. To investigate the mechanism of the thickness
   debit effect, isothermal, constant nominal stress creep tests were
   performed on uncoated PWA1484 Ni-based single-crystal superalloy sheet
   specimens of thicknesses 3.18 and 0.51 mm under two test conditions: 760
   degrees C/758 MPa and 982 degrees C/248 MPa. The specimens contained
   initial microvoids formed during the solidification and homogenization
   processes. The dependence of the creep response on specimen thickness
   differed under the two test conditions: at 760 degrees C/758 MPa there
   was a reduction in the creep strain and the time to rupture with
   decreasing section thickness, whereas at 982 degrees C/248 MPa a
   decreased thickness resulted in an increased creep rate even at low
   strain levels and a decreased time to rupture but with no systematic
   dependence of the creep strain to rupture on specimen thickness. For the
   specimens tested at 760 degrees C/758 MPa microscopic analyses revealed
   that the thick specimens exhibited a mixed failure mode of void growth
   and cleavage-like fracture while the predominant failure mode for the
   thin specimens was cleavage-like fracture. The creep specimens tested at
   982 degrees C/248 MPa in air showed the development of surface oxides
   and a near-surface precipitate-free zone. Finite-element analysis
   revealed that the presence of the alumina layer at the free surface
   imposes a constraint that locally increases the stress triaxiality and
   changes the value of the Lode parameter (a measure of the third stress
   invariant). The surface cracks formed in the oxide scale were arrested
   by further oxidation; for a thickness of 3.18 mm the failure mode was
   void nucleation, growth and coalescence, whereas for a thickness of 0.51
   mm there was a mixed mode of ductile and cleavage-like fracture. (c)

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FATIGUE

PD SEP 2012
PY 2012
AB Thermomechanical fatigue (TMF) is a critical damage process incurred by
   turbine components. The most common methods for simulating the operating
   conditions of turbine components are either in-phase (IP) or
   out-of-phase (OP) TMF tests. However, due to the constantly changing
   temperature and applied load profile, it is challenging to decouple
   dominant damage mechanisms occurring in the material when relying solely
   on TMF test conditions. Further, the time to perform low(er) inelastic
   strain range TMF tests to failure can be cumbersome. This work proposes
   implementation of bithermal fatigue (BiF) tests to address these issues.
   Out-of-phase BiF tests are strain-controlled fatigue tests whereby a
   single cycle consists of an isothermal compressive half-cycle at the
   maximum temperature, followed by stress-free temperature change to the
   minimum temperature; the tensile half-cycle then occurs isothermally at
   the minimum temperature, followed by stress-free temperature change to
   the maximum temperature. Both conventional OP TMF and OP BiF tests were
   performed on nominally < 001 > oriented single crystal superalloy
   specimens. When plotting test results as inelastic strain range versus
   cycles to crack initiation, the OP BiF results exhibit a clear
   demarcation from the TMF data at a particular value of inelastic strain
   range; above which the results are primarily fatigue dominated and
   follow the trend of the OP TMF tests while below the results are
   environmentally dominated, creating a separate trend.
   Thermally-activated base material degradation supports the theory of
   damage driver segregation. A relationship is proposed relating the
   inelastic strain of BiF to that of TMF, for identical lives, within the
   environmentally dominated fatigue region. Finally, a life prediction
   model is proposed that includes fatigue and environmentally assisted
   damage mechanisms, which enables the life estimation of either test
   type. These relationships enable the use of BiF tests in place of, or in
   conjunction with, TMF tests, thereby providing insight into the dominant
   damage mechanisms present during testing and simplifying life prediction
   for more complex TMF cycles. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB An experimental investigation of the microcrack initiation process at
   400 degrees C in nickel-based superalloy with direct aging, DAGH4169, is
   described. The fatigue tests were carried out using a mini
   servo-hydraulic fatigue machine in a scanning electronic microscope
   (SEM) chamber. The entire process of crack initiation (including
   microcrack nucleation, propagation and coalescence) and macrocrack
   formation was observed. It is found that the propagation behaviors of
   cracks nucleated at inclusions (Type I cracks) and in slip bands (Type
   II cracks) are quite different. According to observations from field
   emission scanning electron microscopy, crack closure caused by Ti(C,N)
   debris in cracking gaps is believed to be responsible for the low
   propagation rate of Type I cracks. A three-stage simulation model for
   the crack initiation process is proposed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB Microstructure evolution has been studied in the nickel-based superalloy

   gamma' solvus temperature and to annealing at a supersolvus temperature,
   with a special emphasis on grain size and twin content. Dynamic abnormal
   grain growth occurs before the onset of dynamic recrystallization. The
   resulting bimodal grain size distribution affects the grain-coarsening
   kinetics at the supersolvus temperature, so that the final
   microstructures depend on the former straining stages. As a consequence,
   the twin content does not follow a univocal relationship with the
   average grain size. The grain boundary velocity history before reaching
   the final grain size is a contributing factor, and this is notably
   related to the initial grain size distribution width. Dynamically
   recrystallized microstructures are by nature more homogeneous and thus
   give rise to lower rates in supersolvus grain coarsening, and
   accordingly lead to relatively lower twin densities. (c) 2012 Acta

AB Hot compression tests of the commercial Inconel 625 were performed in

   0.01-10 s(-1). The flow behavior and processing maps were investigated
   using the corrected flow stress data to eliminate effects of the

   domain in the temperature range of 1100-1200 A degrees C and strain rate
   range of 0.01-10 s(-1) corresponding to the higher efficiency of power
   dissipation. Microstructural observations reveal that the full dynamic
   recrystallization (DRX) occurs in this domain, which is optimum
   processing window for hot working to obtain a homogeneous
   microstructure. DRX grain growth occurs in the temperature range of
   1150-1200 A degrees C and strain rate range of 0.01-0.1 s(-1). In view
   of the refined and uniform grains obtained by hot deformation, the
   finish forming processing should be selected the deformation conditions
   in which the full DRX occurs without the grain growth. The small regimes
   of flow instability are noticed at temperature below about 970 A degrees
   C at the different strains. The material undergoes flow instability
   manifesting as bands of flow localizations and high density deformation
   twins. In addition, it is found that the undissolved second-phase
   particles and carbides can promote the DRX processing and be helpful to
   restrict the DRX grain growth.

   superalloy showed high hardness, low strength and low ductility. The
   extensive precipitation of gamma' resulted in high hardness and

AB Post heat treatment fails to refine the grain structure of superalloy
   718. Thus, for components with demanding grain size requirements, the
   forging process should be performed within an extremely limited
   temperature region just below the delta solvus temperature, yet higher
   than that required to induce dynamic recrystallization. The grain size
   of superalloy 718 is generally controlled during manufacturing by
   inducing full dynamic recrystallization through means of a
   carefully-controlled hot forming process performed in a powerful and
   precise forging machine. This work presents an alternative method for
   obtaining a fine and uniform grain structure through means of static
   recrystallization and a proper control of the delta phase formation. In
   the proposed method, the component is cooled in water immediately after
   forging to suppress delta phase precipitation and preserve the internal
   strain energy produced by the hot deformation process. The component is
   then heated to a temperature 30 degrees C lower than the delta solvus
   temperature 1030 degrees C; resulting in a continuous recrystallization
   of the microstructure. Experimental results indicate that gamma '' phase
   precipitation and S phase precipitation dominate the dynamic and static
   recrystallization behaviors observed in the conventional and proposed
   grain refinement methods, respectively. Our results further demonstrate
   that the proposed static recrystallization method yields a fine
   microstructure with an average grain size of ASTM No. 7 (31.8 mu m).
   Thus, the proposed method provides an inexpensive and technically
   straightforward alternative to the conventional hot forming grain
   refinement method. [doi:10.2320/matertrans.M2012090]

   first-generation one and a fourth-generation one containing Re, Ru and
   Hf. The aim of this work is to characterise the microstructural
   evolution of those systems and to correlate it to their resistance to
   spallation. Thermal cycling is carried out at 1100 degrees C in
   laboratory air, with the number of cycles ranging between 10 and 1000.
   Each cycle consists of a 1 h dwell followed by forced-air cooling for 15
   min down to room temperature. Among the main results of this work, it is
   shown that the MCNG-based system is significantly more resistant to
   spallation than the AM1-based one. Up to 50 cycles, both systems exhibit
   similar oxidation rate and phase transformations but major differences
   are observed after long-term ageing. In particular, a Ru-rich beta-phase
   is formed in the bond coat of the MCNG-based system while the AM1-based
   one undergoes strong rumpling of the TGO/bond coat interface due to the
   loss of the thermal barrier coating.

   electrodeposition of Pt followed by vacuum annealing was conducted for
   some of the substrates, and the aluminized and Pt aluminized specimens
   were prepared by the conventional aluminizing process.
   It was found that in the case of the aluminized specimens, voids were
   formed in the vicinity of substrate/coating interfaces, by thermal
   cyclic heating, whereas secondary diffusion zones (SDZ) were formed by
   isothermal heating. These differences in microstructural changes of the
   aluminized specimens can be explained by the diffusion kinetics between
   the coating layer and the substrate during heating/cooling processes. In
   the case of the Pt aluminized specimen, on the other hand, secondary
   reaction zone (SRZ) formation was observed by both the thermal cyclic
   and isothermal treatments. These results can be explained by the poly
   crystallization of the substrate surface by the annealing process that
   could promote the interdiffusion, resulting in the formation of SRZ.

AB The bonding temperature is an important parameter for optimization of
   the Transient Liquid Phase (TLP) bonding process in order to achieve a
   sound joint with good mechanical properties. However, the bonding
   temperature used can also be restricted by the microstructural stability
   of the base metal. In this study, the effect of bonding temperature
   (1050-1200 degrees C) on the joint microstructure and mechanical
   properties was studied for TLP bonding of FSX-414 superalloy using
   MBF-80 interlayer with thickness of 50 mu m.
   Increasing bonding temperature from 1050 to 1150 degrees C caused
   reduction in the time required for complete isothermal solidification in
   agreement with models based on the diffusion induced solid/liquid
   interface motion. But even after 120 min hold time at 1200 degrees C,
   isothermal solidification was not complete and significant liquid
   penetration at grain boundaries adjacent to the joints was observed.
   Heating the base metal specimens to various temperatures of 1160-1190
   degrees C and then water quenching, showed that 1190 degrees C is the
   critical temperature for base metal liquefaction.
   The maximum hardness at isothermal solidification zone and maximum
   hardness of phases at joint and diffusion affected zone was increased
   and decreased, respectively, with increasing temperature up to 1150
   degrees C. Also, the shear strength at complete isothermal
   solidification was increased at the same trend. But a significant
   reduction in shear strength and maximum ISZ hardness were observed for
   sample bonded at 1200 C. Separated bond-line and fracture surface and
   also cleavage-like features were seen at fracture surface of shear
   tested samples for this temperature which are evidences of brittle
   fracture. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   been investigated. In addition, influence of post treatment of the
   coating by two different methods, i.e. sealing and heat treatment, on
   the hot corrosion behavior has also been investigated. Hot corrosion
   studies were conducted on bare steel, as-deposited Cr(3)C(2)-NiCr
   coating and on post treated Cr(3)C(2)-NiCr coating on T91 steel after
   exposure to a molten salt (Na(2)SO(4)-60% V(2)O(5)) environment at 900
   degrees C under cyclic conditions. Each cycle consisted of 1 h heating
   in the silicon carbide tube furnace followed by 20 min cooling in air.
   The mass gain measurements were performed after each cycle to establish
   the kinetics of corrosion using thermogravimetric technique. X-ray
   diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray
   analysis (SEM/EDAX) and X-ray mapping techniques were used to analyze
   the corrosion products. Coated steel showed better resistance to hot
   corrosion as compared to the uncoated counterpart. As-deposited
   Cr(3)C(2)-NiCr coating experienced two stages of hot corrosion, i.e.
   initiation stage and propagation stage. Once the coating entered the
   propagation stage, the protective scale rendered ineffective and
   substrate became vulnerable to hot corrosion. Post treated coating
   resulted to be more effective than as-deposited coating in enhancing the
   corrosion resistance of T91 steel. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Microstructural changes during heat treatment of the Ni-based CMSX-4 and
   CMSX-6 superalloys have been investigated experimentally and simulated
   using a phase-field multi-component model incorporating elastic driving
   forces in the presence of a lattice misfit. Furthermore, a theoretical
   model of the coarsening of anisotropic particles is proposed for the
   prediction of the main kinetic parameters of the coarsening process. A
   comparison of the main characteristics of the microstructural evolution
   during non-directional gamma'-coarsening, provided from both experiments
   and phase-field simulations, gives a good agreement of the coarsening
   kinetics of the CMSX-4 superalloy. However, for the CMSX-6 superalloy,
   phase-field simulation results and theoretical predictions are not
   entirely consistent with experimental results, and show that additional
   effects, for example, those caused by plastic deformation, might be a
   reason for the slow coarsening rate. (C) 2012 Acta Materialia Inc.

AB This paper presents the formulation of a phenomenological model to
   predict the crack growth in single crystal superalloy at high
   temperature. The proposed model relies on an extensive experimental
   study performed on AM1 single crystal superalloy at temperatures ranging
   from 650 degrees C to 950 degrees C. Tests carried out in fatigue and
   creep-fatigue regimes investigate the effects of time on crack growth
   rates. The crack growth model follows the framework of classical linear
   elastic fracture mechanics. Time effects at high temperature are
   captured by creep-fatigue and oxidation-fatigue interactions. The
   specific model formulation for nonisothermal conditions is attractive
   for identifying parameters on a large temperature domain and for
   predicting complex Thermo-Mechanical Fatigue (TMF) tests. Model
   predictions are then compared with a large set of experimental results
   including TMF tests. The application of this model, which accounts for a
   better understanding and modeling of physical phenomena such as the
   environmental or creep effects on crack growth rate, should improve the
   prediction of crack growth regime in single crystal superalloys that are
   used to design critical components such as turbine blades. (C) 2011

   the failure of samples. The microstructures of both the as processed and

   (SEM). The phases of the coatings were analyzed with X-ray
   diffractometry (XRD). XRD analysis revealed that both as sprayed and

   The results showed that the life times of the as sprayed TBCs were

   (Tungsten Inert Gas) welding were subjected to two kinds of post weld
   heat treatment (PWHT): 954 degrees C solution treatment + aging and 1045
   degrees C solution treatment + aging. In both the solution treatments,
   two kinds of intermetallic compounds were observed in the interdendritic
   region of the weld metal, where delta-phase (Ni3Nb) and Laves-phase (
   (Ni,Cr,Fe)(2) (Nb,Ti,Al)) were precipitated. The relationship between
   mechanical properties and microstructures was examined. The tensile
   strength, elongation and creep rupture time of the weld specimen treated
   at 954 degrees C were decreased by TIG welding due to the coalescence of
   voids formed around Laves particles in the weld metal. Compared with the
   base metal, the hardness was decreased in the weld metal while it
   increased in HAZ (Heat Affected Zone). The solution treatment at 1045
   degrees C resulted in dissolution of much more detrimental phases than
   the solution treatment at 954 degrees C. As a result, the ductility and
   creep strength of weld specimen treated at 1045 degrees C were better
   than those of specimen treated at 954 degrees C.

   ranging from 900 to 1150 degrees C and 1 x 10(-3)-10 s(-1),
   respectively. The flow behavior analyses and microstructural
   observations indicate that the softening mechanisms were related to
   dynamic recrystallization (DRX) and grain growth. DRX played a dominant
   role in the microstructural evolution at low temperatures (or high
   strain rates). DRX was the dominant softening effect at low strains on
   testing at high temperatures with low strain rates, whereas growth of
   the dynamically recrystallized grains was responsible for softening at
   high strains. The flow stress of IN 600 was fitted well by the
   constitutive equation of the hyperbolic sine function under the
   deformation conditions performed in this study. A constitutive equation
   as a function of strain was established through a simple extension of

   attributable to the degradation of hot ductility of the alloy due to
   subsolidus grain boundary liquation. A decrease in the magnitude of heat
   input during laser beam welding resulted in increased HAZ cracking. The
   cracking variation with heat input is discussed in relation to the time

   Induced Current Method (ICM). Knowing that localized trapped charges in
   ceramics is a source of damage, the correlation between residual stress
   intensity, apparent-toughness of ceramics and ability to trap charges
   near the interface was demonstrated: the SEMME and ICM measurements of
   the quantities of trapped charges near the interface, highlighted the

   To simulate this effect, the droppings of temperatures during solution
   treatment were chosen and carried out to temperature level of 1118 K
   then heating again to the solution temperature levels. The temperature

AB The mechanical properties of Inconel 718 superalloy are determined
   primarily by its microstructure and grain size. The grain structure of
   Inconel 718 is traditionally refined by aging treatment, and a high
   volume fraction of acicular delta phase precipitates before the
   structure forms. During the following static or dynamic
   recrystallization process, the existing delta phase inhibits
   recrystallized grain growth and acquires a fine grain structure. In the
   proposed approach, the Inconel 718 specimens are re-solution heat
   treated at a temperature higher than the delta solvus temperature to
   ensure thorough dissolution of the precipitated delta phase into the
   austenite matrix and produce a niobium oversaturated matrix. The
   specimens are then cold compressed to produce a dislocation saturated
   matrix and are finally recrystallized at 950 degrees C to induce the
   precipitation of fine delta phase. The delta phase precipitates exert a
   strong grain-boundary pinning effect, and thus a fine grain structure is
   obtained despite the high recrystallization temperature. The average
   grain size in the refined microstructure is found to be 2-3 mu m, which
   is around half that of the grain size in the specimens prepared using
   the conventional process. Hardness testing and tensile testing at 25 and
   650 degrees C revealed its superior mechanical properties.

   The microstructure of the as-cast, heat treated and TLP bonded specimens

   Hardness profiling across the bonding zone showed that isothermal

   conducted; the first experiment was an ex situ study in which samples
   were individually processed with varying degrees of age time before
   measurement. The second experiment was an in situ heat treatment, which
   required heating and then holding the sample at ageing temperature while
   measuring strain using neutron diffraction. The in situ experiment was
   carried out twice using the same setup to assess the repeatability of
   the technique and found to be repeatable within experimental error. The
   agreement between in situ and ex situ experiments was found to be
   reasonable, particularly the manner in which the stresses relaxed with
   time. In both studies it was found that initial stress relaxation was
   rapid, approximately 200 MPa in 15-30 min, after this a slower linear
   relaxation remained for the rest of the ageing heat treatment. This
   behaviour suggests creep may be the means by which stress relaxation
   takes place in this material during ageing. (C) 2011 Published by

   The stronger interfacial strength in the coating system with a diffusion

AB The microstructure of linear friction welds in single crystal (SX) CMSX
   486 superalloy was studied. Gleeble thermomechanical simulation of the
   welding process was also performed in order to understand the
   microstructural changes induced in the alloy during the joining process.
   Microstructural analysis of the welded and Gleeble-simulated specimens
   showed that extensive liquation occurred in the alloy during joining,
   which is in contrast to the general assumption that linear friction
   welding (LFW) occurs exclusively in the solid state. The study revealed
   the application of the compressive load during the forging stage of LFW
   induced rapid solidification of the resultant metastable liquid phase.
   Nevertheless, part of the liquid resulted in a continuous Hf-base oxide
   phase along the weld line. Possible ways of preventing the formation of
   the potentially deleterious oxide film and, thus, improve the prospect
   of applying LFW for the joining of CMSX-486 superalloy are suggested.

AB Iridium modified nickel alluminides are considered promising bond coats
   due to the capability to promote alpha-Al(2)O(3) scale growth and to
   develop the formation of Ir layer acting as oxygen diffusion barrier
   (ODB). An innovative Al-Ni-Ir alloy (Al 60 %at, Ni 35 %at, Ir 5 %at) was
   formulated, taking into account the bond coat appropriate requirements
   and the cost standpoint. A detailed and systematic microstructural
   investigation of both powder and bulk samples was reported, comparing
   the phase composition, thermal stability and oxidation behaviour of the
   proposed system with respect to the Ir free one. The analysed AINiIr
   system was composed of Al(3)Ni(2) and AlNi(3), in addition to the
   beta-NiAl, detected in the reference one. The Ir presence seemed to
   promote the alumina scale growth, starting at around 1000 degrees C.
   Both as cast and oxidised AINiIr bulk samples showed Ni-poor and Al-rich
   islands, in which Ir resulted more concentrated, suggesting an iridium
   higher affinity towards Al with respect to Ni. After the oxidation at
   operative temperature (i.e. 1150 degrees CC), the alpha-Al(2)O(3) scale
   growth was observed, increasing the thickness with the dwelling time.
   Neither Ir ODB nor Ir rich islands at the interface between the alloy
   and the Al(2)O(3) scale were identified, due to the low Ir amount.
   However the presence of metallic Ir and of the compound Al(2.75)Ir was
   detected in the powder after thermal treatment at 1000 degrees C. (C)

   three types of samples: as-sprayed, mechanically smoothed by grinding,
   ground and PVD coated by using aluminum targets in an oxygen atmosphere.
   Samples were tested under isothermal conditions, in air, at 1000 degrees
   C, and up to 5000 h. Morphological, microstructural and compositional
   analyses were performed on the coated samples in order to assess the
   high temperature oxidation behavior provided by the three different
   surface finishing processes. Several differences were observed: grinding
   operations decrease the oxidation resistance, whereas the PVD process
   can increase the performances over longer time with respect of the

AB Haynes HR-120 alloy (UNS N08120) is a nickel-iron-chromium alloy that
   exhibits high strength at elevated temperature and resistance to
   carburising and sulphidising environments. These properties make this
   alloy suitable for the production of components of land based turbines,
   including rings. Manufacture and heat treating of such rings require
   strict control of the processing variables, such as temperature and
   deformation ratios, as well as the time and temperature of the solution
   treatment, due to their effect on microstructure and mechanical
   properties. It is common practice to treat this alloy at temperatures
   above 1100 degrees C to promote dissolution of undesired particles and
   recrystallisation of deformed structures, but it has been found that
   grain coarsening can occur during treatment. The present work presents
   the results of a series of solution heat treatments that were performed
   within a broad range of temperatures on industrial ring rolled pieces.
   It was found that the increment in time and temperature enhances the
   dissolution of intergranular precipitates that result in the improvement
   of mechanical properties, but grain coarsening is observed to occur when
   the material is treated for long times and high temperatures. The best
   combination of mechanical properties and grain size was obtained by
   treating the material for half an hour at 1050 degrees C.

   gamma' precipitates in the creep damaged alloy occurred during different
   solution treatments. The precipitates that did not dissolve completely
   during solution treatment and those formed during subsequent cooling
   were considered to be as remnant and cooling precipitates respectively.
   It was found that higher solution treatment temperatures result in lower
   volume fraction of remnant precipitates and further formation of cooling
   precipitates. Slower cooling rates after solution treatment gave the
   chance for the existing gamma' particles to be coarser. Moreover, aging
   treatment increased the volume fraction of gamma' precipitates. Double
   solution treatment at 1190 degrees C/4 h/furnace cooling+1120 degrees
   C/4 h/air cooling followed by aging at 845 degrees C/24 h/air cooling
   dissolved nearly all the coarsened precipitates and produced a new
   bimodal gamma' microstructure analogous with that of the original alloy.

AB Recent studies have shown the possibility of exploiting the eddy current
   (EC) method for nondestructive characterization of near-surface residual
   stresses in surface-treated nickel-base superalloy components. The
   method involves measuring swept frequency EC signals to obtain
   near-surface electrical conductivity depth profiles, which can be
   converted into residual stress profiles using the empirical
   piezoresistivity relationship. However, the relationship between EC
   responses and residual stress profiles appears to depend on the
   microstructure. This paper reports on a systematic study of
   microstructural effects on the EC responses and near-surface
   conductivity deviation profiles induced by shot peening, using a series
   of heat-treated Inconel 718 samples with different secondary phase
   contents and thus a variety of hardness levels. Calibrated EC signals
   from 100 kHz to 50 MHz were measured from aged and unaged samples,
   before and after shot peening at various Almen intensities. Strong
   dependence of the EC responses on the sample hardness and microstructure
   has been observed. A procedure is introduced to convert the EC signals
   into shot-peening-induced conductivity deviation profiles where the
   microstructure dependency is suppressed. The resulting estimates of the
   conductivity changes are larger than expected, indicating that
   characterization of shot-peening-induced residual stresses by EC
   requires further understanding of the material responses beyond the
   empirical piezoresistivity relationship. Other mechanisms that could
   contribute to the observed conductivity changes are discussed.

AB IN738LC is one of the superior nickel base superalloys utilized at high
   temperatures in aggressive environments. However, experiencing high
   temperatures and stresses during service causes microstructure
   deterioration and degradation of mechanical properties in this alloy. To
   restore the microstructure and mechanical properties of the degraded
   alloy, rejuvenation heat treatments can be considered. In this study,
   the evolution of microstructural features in a creep damaged IN738LC
   superalloy during different stages of rejuvenation heat treatment cycles
   was investigated. During solution treatment stage, dissolution of
   coarsened gamma' precipitates, grain boundary films and transition zone
   around primary MC carbides took place. Solution treatment at high
   temperature led to lower volume fraction and smaller size of remnant
   gamma' precipitates and further dissolution of grain boundary films and
   caused MC carbides to be remained without the surrounding transition
   zone. In addition, fine gamma' precipitates formed during the subsequent
   cooling, namely cooling precipitates, were detected in higher contents
   after solutionizing at higher temperatures. It was found that slower
   cooling rates after solution treatment gave rise to coarser gamma'
   precipitates with higher volume fraction. Among all heat treatment
   cycles investigated, double solution treatment at 1190 degrees C/4 h/FC
   (furnace cooling) + 1120 degrees C/2 h/AC (air cooling) followed by
   aging at 845 degrees C/24 h/AC was successful to revert the
   microstructure back to its virgin state. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All

AB Full homogenisation behaviour of a Ni3Al based alloy containing Cr, Mo,

   of this alloy consists of a c solid solution gamma'(Ni3Al) and a low
   melting point structure. At first, the low melting point structure,
   which is detrimental for full homogenisation process, was eliminated by
   annealing the specimens at 1100 degrees C. After this prerequisite
   process, based on differential thermal analysis results, 1260 degrees C
   was determined for the full homogenisation annealing temperature. The
   results showed that this alloy cannot be fully homogenised without the

   of this local melting phenomenon during full homogenisation treatment,
   some heating cycles were performed at 1200 and 1240 degrees C. A
   scanning electron microscope equipped with energy dispersive

AB A detailed microstructural analysis was performed on a difficult-to-weld
   nickel-base superalloy, IN 738, subjected to linear friction welding and
   Gleeble thermomechanical simulation, to understand the microstructural
   changes induced in the material. Correlations between the
   microstructures of the welded and simulated materials revealed that, in
   contrast to a general assumption of linear friction welding being an
   exclusively solid-state joining process, intergranular liquation, caused
   by nonequilibrium phase reaction(s), occurred during joining. However,
   despite a significant occurrence of liquation in the alloy, no
   heat-affected zone (HAZ) cracking was observed. The study showed that
   the manufacturing of crack-free welds by linear friction welding is not
   due to preclusion of grain boundary liquation, as has been commonly
   assumed and reported. Instead, resistance to cracking can be related to
   the counter-crack-formation effect of the imposed compressive stress
   during linear friction welding and straini-nduced rapid solidification.
   Moreover, adequate understanding of the microstructure of the joint
   requires proper consideration of the concepts of nonequilibrium
   liquation reaction and strain-induced rapid solidification, which are
   carefully elucidated in this work.

AB The weld metal microstructures and the weldability of a
   tantalum-containing cast cobalt-based superalloy were investigated using
   gas tungsten arc welding. It was found that the tantalum carbides in the
   base metal have remained stable up to the fusion line. The results
   showed that the formation of Ta-rich carbides (TaC) is very sensitive to
   time and temperature; so the as-weld microstructure is unstable from a
   metallurgical aspect. The formation of fine precipitates due to the high
   cooling rate of the welding process resulted in a weld metal with an
   undesirable hardness and microstructure after autogenous welding,
   especially after post weld heat treatment. Further results revealed that
   using a filler metal containing significantly less carbon and tantalum
   has solved the mentioned problems and made acceptable welds after post
   weld heat treatment.

AB With the increasing utilization of braze repair in the gas turbine
   industry, the properties of braze joints under simulated service
   conditions become vital in selecting braze repair over other processes.
   While braze repair has often been claimed to deliver mechanical
   properties equivalent to that of the parent material, this is largely
   based on the results of tensile or accelerated creep tests for most gas
   turbine hot section components failure occurs as a result of thermal
   fatigue or thermomechanical fatigue. The damage that occurs under such
   conditions cannot be assessed from tensile or creep testing. This study
   was undertaken to characterize the fatigue properties of narrow and wide
   gap brazed X-40 cobalt-based superalloy and compare these properties to
   that of the X-40 parent material. Butt joint narrow gap and wide gap
   specimens were vacuum brazed using BNi-9 braze alloy. X-40 and IN-738
   were used as additive materials in wide gap braze joints. To
   characterize the fatigue properties of the braze joints and parent
   material, isothermal fatigue tests were conducted at 950 C and under
   load control using a fully reversed sinusoidal wave form having stress
   amplitude of 75% of the yield strength of the parent material. The braze
   specimens were fatigue tested in the as-brazed condition. The fatigue
   test results showed that the fatigue lives of the brazed specimens were
   lower than that of the parent material, particularly for the narrow gap
   samples and wide gap samples containing IN-738 additive alloy. All
   fatigue failures in the brazed samples occurred in the braze joints. An
   analysis of the fracture surfaces using a scanning electron microscope
   revealed that porosity was the major contributing factor to fatigue
   failures in the wide gap braze joints. The testing life debit observed
   in the narrow gap braze samples can be attributed to the presence of
   brittle boride phases in the braze joint. This study also included
   examination of techniques for reducing the aforementioned porosity and
   presence of brittle intermetallic phases.

AB Hot deformation behavior of the post-cogging FGH4096 superalloy with

   compression in the temperature (T-d) ranging 1050-1140 degrees C and
   strain rates ((epsilon) over dot) ranging 0.001-1.0 s(-1). The apparent
   activation energy of deformation was calculated to be 750 kJ/mol. This
   value is well above that for the HIPed superalloy, which is believed to
   attribute to the refinement of grain size and boundary structure after
   cogging treatment. The constitutive equation that described the flow
   stress as a function of the strain rate and deformation temperature was
   proposed for high temperature deformation. The processing maps were
   constructed to evaluate the efficiency of power dissipation (eta) and
   recognize the instability regimes for the final-forging process. Optimum
   parameters were predicted in temperatures of 1080-1110 degrees C and
   strain rates of 0.1-1.0 s(-1), in which the eta values were higher than
   others. Otherwise, the plasticity instability was predicted in two
   regimes, the first of the temperatures of 1100-1120 degrees C and strain
   rate higher than 0.4 s(-1), and the second of the temperatures lower
   than 1060 degrees C and strain rates of 0.001-0.4 s(-1). (c) 2011

AB Isothermal, uniaxial compression tests and accompanying numerical
   simulations were conducted on Waspaloy-ingot specimens to quantify
   deformation heterogeneity during hot working of coarse, columnar-grain
   materials. This was used as a means to approximate deformation
   processing in ingot materials. Electron-backscatter-diffraction (EBSD)
   measurements were made before and after compression testing to quantify
   microstructure evolution. A crystal-plasticity finite-element-method
   model, in which the starting microstructure was instantiated using EBSD
   scans of the undeformed material, was used to simulate the deformation.
   Good agreement was found between observations and simulation predictions
   of specimen profiles and intra-grain misorientations. The simulation
   results also revealed that the grain neighborhood appeared to be a
   principal factor controlling the heterogeneity of deformation at the
   grain scale. Significant differences in the simulated deformation of a
   given grain were noted for various arrangements of the orientations of
   its neighbors. In particular, the first-and second-nearest neighbors of
   a given grain have the most significant effect on heterogeneous
   deformation behavior.

AB In laser powder deposition (LPD) repair of nickel-based turbine blades,
   hot cracking is the most common defect. The cracking has been found to
   be associated with thermal stress concentration and low-melting
   constituents on the grain boundaries. For directionally solidified and
   single-crystal blades, a positive correlation is established between
   cracking and the "stray grain" formation. Control of the deposit molten
   pool shape has been proposed as an effective method to limit the stray
   grains. However, in multi-bead, multi-layer LPD with a pulsed laser, due
   to a much more complex bead geometry, appearance of stray grains seems
   to be random. To obtain insight into cracking and stray grain formation
   during multi-bead LPD process on nickel-based superalloys, a 3-D
   transient finite element (FE) model has been developed and a
   thermomechanical analysis is performed. Time-dependent temperature and
   thermal strain fields have been predicted. The developed thermal model
   has been applied to predict and analyze the distribution of thermal
   stress concentration and the tendency of stray grain formation. The
   reliability and accuracy of the model are verified experimentally by the
   measured temperature field profile and the observation of

   were found by neutron diffraction in the weld region along with axial
   bending stresses (tensile toward the inner diameter (ID)/compressive
   toward the outer). The evolution of these residual stress levels during
   postweld heat treatment (PWHT) was mapped experimentally over the weld
   cross section. After 8 hours of PWHT, the axial stresses relaxed by 70
   pct, whereas the hoop stresses reduced by only 50 pct. Some scatter of
   residual stress evolution was found between samples, particularly for
   the axial stress direction. This was attributed to substandard tooling
   to grip the rings. The results on subscale samples were transferred to a
   full-scale aeroengine (650-mm diameter) compressor drum assembly that
   was postweld heat treated for 8 hours. It was found that the residual
   stresses, particularly in the axial direction, were noticeably lower in
   this full-scale weld component compared to the subscale weld heat
   treated for the same time. The differences seem to be best rationalized
   by the different standards of jigging used during joining these two
   types of welds.

AB This work concerns the characterization of the thermodynamic behavior of

   superalloys are used in aeronautical construction, in the hot parts of
   the turbine. They are frequently used for the production of the paddles.
   The parts in service are subjected to dynamic solicitations and thermal
   fluctuations over the course of time. They are responsible for
   modification and degradation of material properties. This can lead to
   the appearance of cracks and, in the long term, to the rupture of these
   parts. In this paper, a preliminary physical study is made on the
   appearance of the cracks, followed by experiments using shocks at
   ambient temperature and under a heating situation which simulates
   combustion. It is found that these dynamic loads have a significant
   impact on the development of the cracks that appear on the segments of
   the turbine nozzle. The study is devoted to the elastic shock of
   Hertz-Boussinesq extended to viscoelastic bodies by direct convolution
   of Riemann-Stielges. The interest resides in the local convolution and
   the distribution of stresses in the contact zone. The shock excitation
   method includes a deduced force in the load and disload phases. This
   force is an impulse which approaches a Dirac function. The sample can be
   modeled approximately by a system of one degree of freedom for natural
   frequency, damping and transfer function. The spectral response of the
   specified shock allows calculation of the damping. Every point of this
   spectrum gives the response for the linear system of the transfer
   function. Then, viscoelastic shock parameters are deduced.

AB A new superalloy, ATI 718Plus alloy (718Plus), has been developed to
   have a 55 degrees C higher temperature capability over the traditionally
   used alloy 718, while maintaining favourable processing characteristics
   and intrinsic raw material costs. The fatigue and dwell fatigue
   behaviour of four microstructural variations of 718Plus are evaluated
   and compared with Waspaloy: standard heat treated condition (HT1),
   standard heat treated condition with thermal exposure at 732 degrees C
   (1350 degrees F) for 1000 h (HT2), fine grain condition with a modified
   delta phase (HT3) and fine grain overaged through modified heat
   treatment (HT4). Fatigue crack growth rate tests were performed at 649
   degrees C (1200 degrees F) and 704 degrees C (1300 degrees F) under
   constant amplitude loading at 10 Hz or with a 100 s tension dwell. The
   results show that the steady state fatigue crack growth rates of each
   microstructural variation and both alloys are identical, with all of the
   718Plus variations showing a clear advantage over Waspaloy in the
   fatigue crack threshold regime. The 718Plus variants HT1 and HT3
   exhibited the highest fatigue crack growth threshold, followed closely
   by HT4 and finally HT2. At 649 degrees C (1200 degrees F), the 718Plus
   alloys had average threshold values ranging from 8.8 to 10.4 MPa m(1/2)
   whereas the Waspaloy material was 6.1-7.5 MPa m(1/2). At 704 degrees C
   (1300 degrees F), the advantage increased with the 718Plus alloys having
   average threshold values ranging from 10.1 to 11.6 MPa m(1/2) compared
   with Waspaloy, which exhibited average threshold values of 6.6-7.7 MPa
   m(1/2). Dwell fatigue results show that Waspaloy has better resistance
   to crack propagation under dwell conditions; however, optimisation of
   the precipitate phase (HT2) shows vast improvement in the dwell fatigue
   resistance of 718Plus.

AB For the production of nickel-based superalloys for the aerospace
   industry, strict control of the macrostructure of the product is
   necessary to avoid the appearance of potentially fatal defects. Our
   study focuses on the prevention of "white spots" in the alloy IN 718.
   These defects, which are small volumes of a few millimeters of
   characteristic length, are depleted in niobium. They are known to result
   from the fall of metal fragments in the liquid pool during VAR
   processing. According to their history in the liquid metal, these
   fragments could not being remelted before being trapped in the mushy
   zone and then give rise to defects. A model calculates the heat transfer
   in such a precursor to simulate its melting during his stay in the bath.
   The validation of the predicted melting kinetics requires a series of
   immersive experiences of synthetic defects in a metal bath. The model
   and experiments have demonstrated the initial solidification of a layer
   of metal around the precursor.

   718 alloy under wet cutting conditions. Qualitative and quantitative
   mechanical and metallurgical characterization of the surface and
   subsurface region was undertaken using nanoindentation, backscatter
   electron microscopy, electron backscatter diffraction microscopy and
   transmission electron microscopy. The analysis revealed three different
   zones, namely, a highly deformed nanostructured surface layer containing
   ultra-fine and high aspect ratio grains drawn out by large scale
   deformation, a deformed subsurface layer and finally the unaffected
   parent metal. The nano-hardness, plastic deformation, microstructure and
   crystal misorientation were assessed. The correlation between the
   modified surface and subsurface layers and the cutting conditions was
   established. The phenomena behind the formation of the different zones
   were investigated. The results suggest that subsurface alterations are
   driven by thermo-mechanical loading, causing plasticity and grain
   refinement by excessive shearing local to the cut surface.

AB HAYNES 282 and HAYNES 230 nickel-based superalloys were subjected to
   cold rolling deformation and heat treatments in order to investigate
   processing-microstructure-property relationships to understand the
   effects of thermomechanical processing on their microstructure and
   tensile-creep behavior. The sheet materials underwent four cycles of 20%
   reduction in thickness followed by a solution treatment. The resultant
   microstructures were characterized using electron backscattered
   diffraction and electron microscopy, and the high-temperature (973-1088
   K (700-815 degrees C)) creep and fatigue behavior was evaluated and
   compared to the commercially available sheet alloys. The
   thermomechanical processing treatments did not significantly affect the
   grain boundary character distribution and almost half of all the
   boundaries in the microstructures were twin boundaries. The creep
   resistance was shown to degrade with the additional thermomechanical
   treatments, which resulted in finer equiaxed grain sizes. The HAYNES 282
   alloy was shown to be significantly more creep resistant than the HAYNES
   230 alloy. The fatigue behavior indicated that creep ratcheting occurred
   more prominently in the HAYNES 230 alloy than in the HAYNES 282 alloy
   and this was explained to be a result of the superior creep resistance
   exhibited by the HAYNES 282 alloy. Overall, this study suggests that
   additional energy-intensive processing treatments, beyond those involved
   in the commercially available sheet products, may not be beneficial for
   additional creep resistance. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Hot deformation characteristics of a Fe-base superalloy were studied at

   characterize the dependence of peak stress on deformation temperature
   and strain rate. Hot deformation apparent activation energy of the
   Fe-24Ni-11Cr-1Mo-3Ti superalloy was determined to be about 499 kJ/mol.
   The processing maps obtained in a strain range of 0-1-0.7 were

AB In this paper, the hot deformation characteristics of P/M nickel-base
   superalloy FGH96 prepared by different powder preparation technologies
   were studied in the deformation temperature range from 1000 degrees C to
   1100 degrees C and the strain rate range from 0.001 s(-1) to 1 s(-1)
   using hot compression tests. The peak stress vs. deformation temperature
   curves and the peak stress vs. strain rate curves were established,
   respectively. The results show that the specimens prepared by plasma
   rotation electric pole (PREP) powder were more sensitive to deformation
   temperature and strain rate. On the basis of the dynamic material model,
   the processing maps for hot working were developed. The activation
   energies and Zener-Hollomon parameters were obtained by linear
   statistical regression method. For the specimens prepared by PREP
   powder, the peaks of power dissipation mainly located in lower
   temperature domain (1000-1030 degrees C), and the efficiencies of power
   dissipation (EPD) obtained in the strain range from 0.1 to 0.7 were
   essentially similar. This indicated that strain had a slight influence
   on processing maps. For the specimens prepared by argon atomization (AA)
   powder, the effects of strain on EPD and instability domains were
   significant. The lower activation energies and Z values indicated that
   the workability of the specimens prepared by AA powder is better than
   that prepared by PREP powder. Moreover, it was found that effects of the
   heat treatment time on activation energy and Zener-Hollomon parameter
   were significant. With the increase of heat treatment time, the
   dislocation density and the volume fraction of precipitation phase
   gradually decreased. Microstructural observation demonstrated that the
   phenomenon of recrystallized grains coarsening existed in the specimens
   prepared by longer heat treatment time. The heat treatment time of the
   specimens prepared by AA powder should be appropriately shortened in
   order to prevent recrystallized grains coarsening. (C) 2011 Elsevier

   morphology and microstructure together with high temperature oxidation
   behaviors at 1000, 1100 and 1150 C for the two different coatings were
   investigated. The results show that after vacuum annealing, the

   small quantity of beta-NiAl dispersed in gamma'/gamma while the outer
   layer of the gradient coating consists of beta-NiAl and dispersed
   alpha-Cr and Cr(3)Si in beta-NiAl and the inner layer consists of

   excellent oxidation resistance only at 1000 degrees C, while it degraded
   rapidly at 1100 degrees C and 1150 degrees C, on which surface spinel
   formation was observed; however, the gradient coating has more excellent
   oxidation resistance than the conventional one at all the three
   temperatures. After oxidation for 300 h at 1100 degrees C, there still
   exists a great amount of beta-NiAl, and even after oxidation for 300 h
   at 1150 degrees C, Al content is higher than 8% (mass fraction), in

   the formation and self repair of alumina.

   treatment because the temperature of 1000 degrees C apparently was too
   low. Mechanical testing of the layer structured material, parallel and
   perpendicular to the built layers, revealed sufficient strength in both
   directions. However, it showed only limited elongation when tested

AB The heat affected zone (HAZ) cracking behaviour in a laser beam
   directionally solidified (DS) Rene 80 nickel based superalloy subjected
   to preweld heat treatments was studied. The HAZ cracks in the alloy are
   grain boundary liquation cracks caused by liquation reaction of both
   non-equilibrium secondary solidification product, MC carbides and
   equilibrium solid state reaction product, gamma' precipitates. In
   contrast to theoretical prediction based a preweld heat treatment that
   reduced grain boundary liquid film thickness did not result in a lower
   HAZ cracking, which can be related to concomitant reduction in the
   ability of the base alloy to relax welding stress. In addition,
   formation of intergranular M5B3 boride particles in preweld alloy
   appeared to have aided cracking susceptibility by lowering grain
   boundary liquation temperature and widening the brittle temperature
   range in the HAZ during cooling. Based on the analysis of the results,
   application of a new preweld heat treatment that prevents the formation
   of the intergranular borides and induces moderate base alloy hardness
   resulted in a nearly crack free HAZ in laser welded DS Rene 80

AB Nickel-based superalloys are predominantly used as structural materials
   in high-temperature applications due to their exceptional
   high-temperature strength based on precipitation hardening by the
   coherent gamma'-phase. In modern superalloys, the gamma'-phase fraction
   can amount to 75%, at which gamma'-precipitates align as cubes parallel
   to the < 0 0 1 > directions of the crystal lattice. At high temperatures
   and under a mechanical load, e.g. during service in gas turbines, the
   gamma'-cubes coalesce to gamma'-rafts, generating an interpenetrating
   microstructure of gamma and gamma'. By extracting one phase of this
   interpenetrated network, nanoporous superalloy membranes containing
   channel-like interconnected pores are produced. So far, this can only be
   achieved by applying simultaneously thermal and mechanical loads during
   tensile creep deformation. Here, a new production process is presented.
   Due to internal stresses, load-free aging of single-crystalline
   superalloys, e.g. CMSX-4, also generates an interpenetrating
   microstructure of gamma and gamma'. This can be utilized to manufacture
   nanoporous superalloy membranes in the absence of an external mechanical
   load. The advantage of this process is its simplicity and the potential
   to fabricate larger membranes than possible by the costly tensile creep
   deformation process currently used. (C) 2011 Acta Materialia Inc.

   The shallow cellular interface arised at V=2 mu m/s. With increasing the
   withdrawal rate, the S/L interface turns into deep cellular (V=3 mu m/s)
   and dendritic (V >= 5 mu m/s) interfaces successively. The cellular
   spacing is increased with increasing the withdrawal rate. However, the
   primary dendritic arm spacing is decreased with increasing the
   withdrawal rate. The maximum value of cellular/dendritic spacings
   appears at transition from cellular to dendritic interfaces (V=5 mu
   m/s). Meanwhile, the morphology of MC carbide changes from octahedron to
   frame-like, Chinese-script and finally to fine dendrite with increasing
   the withdrawal rate. Compared with the theoretical models of primary
   dendrite spacing, the results are good in agreement with Trivedi's and
   Ma's models. Furthermore, they are also in agreement with Hunt-Lu model
   only at lower withdrawal rates (V <= 50 mu m/s). The relationships of
   primary and secondary dendritic arm spacings with withdrawal rates can
   be described as lambda(1)=314.6V(-0.24+/-0.02) and
   lambda(2)=97.76V(-0.33+/-0.01), respectively. MC carbide precipitated

   phase to control grain growth. Increasing the solution temperature above
   that recommended for the alloy resulted in eventual solution of the
   Laves phase and concomitant grain growth. In the STA condition, in
   addition to the Laves phase, a copious precipitation of a gamma' phase
   (Ni(3)TiNb) was observed. In addition, a limited observation was made of
   the early stages of the transition of some of the gamma' phase to the
   epsilon phase for the over aged condition. There was no epsilon phase
   observed in the STA condition. A final observation was the presence of
   'black grain' previously reported in the literature, in both the ST and
   STA conditions in the authors' research. The present view is that the
   phenomenon is an etching artefact and not a genuine microstructural
   feature.

   hyperbolic-sine type equation. The activation energy for the
   delta-processed superalboy 718 is determined to be 467 kJ/mol. The
   change of the dominant deformation mechanisms leads to the decrease of

   much faster than that under static conditions. Dislocation, vacancy and
   curvature play important roles in the dissolution of delta phases. The
   main nucleation mechanisms of dynamic recrystallization (DRX) for the
   delta-processed superalloy 718 include the bulging of original grain
   boundaries and the delta phase stimulated DRX nucleation, which is
   closely related to the dissolution behavior of delta phases under
   certain deformation conditions. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB NiCrAlY is commonly used as the bond coat material in thermal barrier
   coatings (TBCs). Detailed investigation into the microstructural
   evolution at high temperatures and the consequent changes in
   microhardness in NiCrAlY bond coats is challenging due to the complexity
   in microstructure and composition caused by thermal spray processes and
   the presence of a superalloy substrate and a ceramic top coat in the
   TBC. In an effort to simplify the system, fully dense NiCrAlY bulk
   samples were prepared by spark plasma sintering (SPS) at 1000 degrees C.
   The microstructure, phase composition and microhardness of the samples,
   in the as-sintered condition and select
   heat-treated-in-argon-and-quenched conditions (1000 degrees C, 10 h &
   50h; 1050 degrees C, 10h & 50h; 1100 degrees C, 10 h & 50h), were
   studied by means of SEM, EDAX, HR-TEM and microhardness testing. It was
   found that the microstructure and phase compositions changed
   significantly after heat treatment. Additionally, the average
   microhardness of the samples decreased as the heat-treatment temperature
   and time increased, except for in the samples heat treated at 1000
   degrees C for 50 h, 1050 C for 10 h and 1050 C for 50h. To clarify this
   anomalous behavior, microhardness was carefully measured within select
   grains. Results indicate that the alpha-Cr phase, as confirmed with
   HR-TEM, which appeared within the beta-NiAl grains after these three
   heat-treatment conditions but subsequently disappeared from the
   beta-NiAl grains after heat treatment at 1100 degrees C, strengthened
   the overall microstructure. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Co(45)Ni(25)Ga(30) ferromagnetic shape memory alloys were treated by
   glass fluxing combined with superheating cycling. The effect of high
   undercooling on solidified microstructure and transformation
   temperatures was investigated. The martensite lath is obviously refined
   and a mass of sub-grains are produced with the increase of undercooling.
   Undercooling rapid solidification introduces a number of dislocations
   and large internal stress, which give rise to the production of
   sub-grains in recovery. During the following annealing process, these
   sub-grains can gradually recrystallize and grow up with an amount of
   gamma' phase precipitated. Meanwhile, transformation temperatures of
   undercooled alloys are greatly elevated compared with those of as cast,
   which results from the large internal stress, and gradually reduce with
   the heating time. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   barrier coating for nickel superalloy substrates. The (NiCoCrAlY) layer
   was deposited using the electrophoretic deposition technique, the MgO
   layer was deposited by the electrolytic deposition technique and the YSZ
   layer was electrophoretically deposited. The process of depositing
   (NiCoCrAlY) alloy particles revealed that the electrophoretic technique
   can be used for particles with submicron dimensions. The MgO

AB Electrophoretic deposition (EPD) was showed to be a feasible and
   convenient method to fabricate NiCoCrAlY coatings on nickel based
   supperalloys. The microstructure and composition of the NiCoCrAlY
   coatings after vacuum heat treatment were characterized by X-ray
   diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy
   dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX). Isothermal-oxidation test was
   performed at 1100 degrees C in static air for 100 h. The results show
   that the major phases in electrophoretic deposited and vacuum heat
   treated NiCoCrAlY coating are gamma-Ni and gamma'-Ni3Al phases, also
   there is an extremely small quantity of Al2O3 in the coating.
   Composition fluctuations occur in the coating and a certain amount of
   titanium diffuse from the superalloy substrate to the top of the coating
   during vacuum heat treatment. The oxidation test results exhibit that
   the oxidation kinetics of this coating has two typical stages. The
   protective oxide layer is mainly formed in the initial linear growth
   stage and then the oxide layer hinders further oxidation of the coating
   in the subsequent parabolic growth stage. The coating can effectively
   protect the superalloy substrate from oxidation. A certain amount of
   rutile TiO2 is formed in the coating during oxidation and it is adverse
   to the oxidation resistance of the coating. Crown Copyright (C) 2010

AB Inert gas (high purity argon) atomised powder of composition conforming
   to that of the superalloy Udimet 720 of low interstitial grade was
   hipped at 1200 degrees C/120 MPa/3 h. The hipped alloy has shown near
   theoretical density and consisted of equiaxed grains with an average
   diameter of similar to 45 mu m. While primary gamma'-Ni3 (Ti, Al)
   precipitates with an acicular morphology were found at the grain
   boundaries, finer secondary gamma' precipitates with near cuboidal
   morphology were present in the austenite gamma matrix. The yield
   strength (YS) of the as hipped alloy was found to be the same as that of
   the wrought alloy heat treated for creep applications (termed as creep
   resistant alloy) at room temperature (RT) as well as at 650 degrees C.
   However, the ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and ductility were found to
   be higher than those of the wrought creep resistant alloy. On the other
   hand, the YS and UTS of the as hipped material were lower than those of
   the wrought alloy heat treated for high strength applications (termed as
   high strength alloy), although the ductility of the former was
   comparable to that of the latter. In order to improve the strength, the
   hipped alloy was subjected to a heat treatment consisting of solution
   treatment followed by two-step aging. Extensive precipitation of fine
   and coarse gamma' precipitates with cuboidal morphology during duplex
   aging treatment has led to a considerable improvement in YS and UTS of
   the alloy, although the corresponding ductility dropped moderately at RT
   and at 650 degrees C. Fractography of the tensile tested specimens has
   shown ductile transgranular mode of fracture in the as hipped alloy at
   RT and at 650 degrees C, while the hipped+heat treated alloy exhibited a
   mixed mode of fracture at those temperature. The stress rupture
   properties of the as hipped alloy compare well with those of the wrought
   alloy and have been found to improve significantly after heat treatment.
   The present investigation reveals that the hipped superalloy Udimet
   720LI has substantial potential for use in the development of near net
   shaped components for aerospace applications.

AB The effect of ultrasonic nanocrystal surface modification (UNSM) on
   Pt-modified aluminide coatings on Ni-based superalloy was investigated.
   UNSM was applied to make the grain size finer and to release compressive
   stress on the Al oxide film by reducing surface roughness. A Pt layer,
   with a thickness of 10-11 mu m, was coated on a superalloy and
   transformed to a Ni-Pt alloy layer by annealing, at 1050 degrees C for 3
   h. Before pack aluminizing, the surface of the Ni-Pt alloy layer was
   shocked by UNSM. The grain size of this UNSM-shocked Ni-Pt alloy layer
   was finer than the grain size on the untreated specimen. During pack
   aluminizing, the treated Pt-modified aluminide coating had more Al
   uptake and greater thickness than the untreated Pt-modified aluminide
   coating, because many grain boundaries and volume increase were incurred
   by UNSM. Furthermore, the treated coating displayed a smoother surface
   before, and after, pack aluminizing. The treated coating showed superior
   cyclic oxidation resistance. The decrease of surface roughness in the
   treated coatings diminished compressive stress, which caused spallation
   of the thermally grown oxide (TGO) and faster depletion of Al. Faster Al
   depletion in the untreated coating led to a phase transformation, from
   beta-NiAl to gamma'-Ni3Al, and then to changes in volume and solubility
   of the alloying element, Cr. The increase of the surface and interface
   roughness was a result of the change in volume as well as the increased
   stress and strain between the TGO and the coating. Additionally, the
   increasing solubility of the alloying element, Cr, in the coating,
   resulted in the formation of a large amount of Cr- and Ni-related
   oxides, which are unstable in the TGO during cyclic oxidation.
   Spallation of the TGO caused an accelerated rate of Al depletion in the
   untreated coating, and a faster degradation rate than in the treated
   coatings. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB A comparative study of the characteristics of thermally grown oxide
   (TGO) formation under stepped (intermediate temperature dwell) thermal
   cycling on EQ (equilibrium) and NiCoCrAlY bond coats employed in thermal
   barrier systems, has been conducted. EQ bond coats are designed to be
   chemically compatible with the superalloy substrate, so that expansion
   mismatch and interdiffusion with the substrate are minimized. Stress
   mapping of the TGO was performed using luminescence spectroscopy.
   Regions of interest were cross-sectioned using focused ion beam
   techniques, to enable sub-surface examination by scanning electron
   microscopy. In the case of the NiCoCrAlY bond coat, stepped cycling
   resulted in severe surface undulations as a consequence of bond coat
   rumpling, a major problem in the application of TBCs, since it can lead
   to failure of the ceramic top coat. When the rumpling amplitude becomes
   sufficiently large, creep cracks develop in the TGO at the apex of the
   undulations, causing stress relaxation. The rumpling behavior arises due
   to creep displacements in the bond coat during the dwell period. No such
   rumpling was evident in the EQ bond coats. However, significant TGO
   spalling was observed in the EQ material with associated spinel
   formation. The evidence indicates that the spalls occurred at the
   TGO/bond coat interface. Spalling was less extensive in the NiCoCrAlY
   material, and the spalls were located entirely within the TGO. In both
   materials, regions of reduced TGO compressive stress coincided with the
   presence of yttria-rich particles. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   cycle consisted of 1 hour heating in the silicon carbide tube furnace
   followed by 20 minutes cooling in air. Measurement of mass change was
   used to approximate the kinetics of corrosion. X-ray diffraction (XRD)
   and scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive spectroscopy
   (SEM/EDS) were used to characterise the corrosion products. To ascertain
   the rate of corrosion the parabolic rate constants (k(p)) were obtained
   from the slope of the linear regression fitted of (cumulative weight

   was not parabolic and it suffered corrosion in the form of peeling up
   and spallation of its oxide scale. On the contrary, the Ni-20Cr coated
   steel followed a parabolic rate law and showed reduced rates of
   corrosion in comparison with its uncoated counterpart. The loss of
   material owing to high temperature corrosion of the steel was reduced
   appreciably after the application of the coating.

   use of a welding filler wire produced a sound fusion zone with no

   zone (HAZ) and was observed to be significantly influenced by pre-weld
   heat treatment and laser welding speed. Crack-free weld was produced by
   a pre-weld heat treatment that minimised non-equilibirum grain boundary
   boron segregation and inhibited grain growth. While post-weld heat
   treatment (PWHT) reduced the difference between the hardness values of
   the base alloy, HAZ and the fusion zone, it resulted in increased HAZ
   cracking, which was likely aided by pre-existing cracks. The PWHT
   cracking was, however, avoided by subjecting pre-weld material to the

   process.

AB Investment cast Co-29Cr-6Mo-0.33C alloy tensile test specimens were
   subjected to heat treatment at 1230 degrees C under argon atmosphere for
   different times to ascertain what enhancement of tensile properties
   could be achieved by such processing. Improvements in tensile properties
   were observed in the 2 h annealed specimen. Also, tempering of this
   specimen at different times shows that tensile properties and hardness
   increase and exceed those of the ASTM specification. However, elongation
   decreases during tempering. The annealed specimen has better corrosion
   resistance in comparison with as cast specimen.

AB An experimental investigation, combining synchrotron X-ray powder
   diffraction, small-angle neutron scattering and transmission electron
   microscopy, has been undertaken to study the microstructure of
   nanoprecipitates in a nickel-based superalloy. Upon increasing the
   ageing time during a heat-treatment process, the average size of the
   precipitates first decreases before changing to a monotonically growth
   stage. Possible reasons for this observed structural evolution, which is
   predicted thermodynamically, are suggested.

   were evaluated and are reported in this paper. Total strain controlled
   LCF tests have been conducted in air at 550 degrees C at a nominal
   strain rate of 6.67 x 10(-3) s(-1). The as-HIPed Udimet 720 Li exhibits
   stable behaviour followed by very mild cyclic hardening at total strain
   amplitudes +/- 0.4-0.5%. However, cyclic hardening has been observed at
   total strain amplitudes +/- 0.6-1.2%. The cyclic hardening is attributed
   to dynamic strain aging (DSA). The dual slope behaviour in a
   Coffin-Manson plot is attributed to a change in fracture mechanism.

AB Segregation behavior is an important problem in solidification process
   of alloys, which determines their growth morphologies, phase
   distributions and concentration segregations so that it affects the
   mechanical properties of alloys, such as fatigue lives, creep properies,
   etc.. However, the segregation behaviors of Ni-based superalloys are
   very complex that contain multi-components and consist of multi-phases.
   The solute partition coefficient is a key characteristic parameter to
   express the solute segregation level and tendency in a solidification
   process. In the present paper, the solute profiles in directionally
   solidified DZ125 alloy with planar interface growth, which was obtained
   through experiments of quenching during directional solidification, have
   been measured by electron probe micro analysis (EPMA). The steady state
   of solute redistribution hardly reaches due to melt flow during
   solidification process. The contents of gamma' phase forming elements,
   Al, Ti, Ta, Mo and Ni, along longitudinal direction increase with the
   increase of solidified fraction, while those of W, Cr and Co decrease.
   The results show that the solute partition coefficients of Al, Ti, Ta,
   Mo and Ni are less than unit, those of W, Cr and Co are more than unit.
   In addition, the solute distribution in solid phase with dendrite growth
   is similar to that with planar interface growth. Compared the
   experimental results of microsegregation with the calculated ones of
   Scheil model and Brody-Flemings model, the Brody-Flemings model fits
   better with the experimental results. It indicates that the
   back-diffusion in solid phase would reduce the microsegregation during
   dendrite growth.

AB Serial sectioning methods continue to produce a wealth of image data for
   quantifying the three-dimensional nature of material microstructures. In
   this work, we discuss a computational methodology for automated
   detection and 3D characterization of dendrite cores from images taken
   from slices of a production turbine blade made of a heat-treated single
   crystal Ni-based superalloy. The dendrite core locations are detected
   using an automated segmentation technique that incorporates information
   over multiple length scales and exploits the four-fold symmetry of the
   dendrites when viewed down the (100) growth direction. Additional rules
   that take advantage of the continuity of the dendrites from slice to
   slice help to exclude segmentation artifacts and improve dendrite core
   segmentation. The significance of this technique is that it may be
   extended to include any symmetric features. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All

AB Recent trials have produced tungsten-inert-gas (TIG)-welded structures
   of a suitable scale to allow an evaluation of the technique as an
   economic and commercial process for the manufacture of complex
   aeroengine components. The employment of TIG welding is shown to have
   specific advantages over alternative techniques based on metal inert gas
   (MIG) systems. Investigations using the nickel-based superalloy 718 have
   shown that TIG induces a smaller weld pool with less compositional
   segregation. In addition, because the TIG process involves a pulsed
   power source, a faster cooling rate is achieved, although this rate, in
   turn, compromises the deposition rate. The microstructures produced by
   the two techniques differ significantly, with TIG showing an absence of
   the detrimental delta and Laves phases typically produced by extended
   periods at a high temperature using MIG. Instead, an anisotropic
   dendritic microstructure was evident with a preferred orientation
   relative to the axis of epitaxy. Niobium was segregated to the
   interdendritic regions. A fine-scale porosity was evident within the
   microstructure with a maximum diameter of approximately 5 mu m. This
   porosity often was found in clusters and usually was associated with the
   interdendritic regions. Subsequent postdeposition heat treatment was
   shown to have no effect on preexisting porosity and to have a minimal
   effect on the microstructure.

   annealing at 1000 degrees C resulted in significant coating-substrate
   interdiffusion and in the formation of an interdiffusion zone, the
   extent/thickness of which decreased with the addition of Hf Annealing
   additionally produced gamma'-Ni3Al precipitates in the binary coatings
   and nanometer-sized Hf-rich precipitates in Hf-containing coatings. The
   majority of these precipitates were identified as the equilibrium
   Heusler (i e, Ni2AlHf) phase; however, when Hf-containing specimens were
   annealed in a high carbon environment, significant concentrations of
   carbon were incorporated Into the coatings. This sometimes resulted in

AB The hot deformation behavior of a powder metallurgy (P/M) Ni-base
   superalloy FGH96 was investigated at the temperature (T) of 1050-1140
   degrees C, strain rate (epsilon) of 0.002-1.0 s(-1), and the height
   reduction of 20-50% via isothermal hot compression experiment. The flow
   behavior and the microstructural mechanism of the synthesized superalloy
   were systematically studied. The processing map was constructed based on
   the experiment data to evaluate the efficiency of power dissipation and
   recognize the instability regimes for forging process determination. The
   processing map with the strain of 0.15 exhibits a smooth and small
   variation of eta and predicts a little instability regime confined at
   (T: 1050 degrees C, epsilon : 1.0 s(-1)), attributed to the previous
   particle boundary (PPB) cracks. The map obtained at the strain of 0.65
   reveals a large domain with the efficiency above 40% and predicts two
   instability regimes at around (1050 degrees C, 1s(-1)) and located in
   the regime of (T: 1080-1140 degrees C, epsilon : 0.002 - 0.01 s(-1)),
   respectively. The optimum processing condition is identified as (T: 1140
   degrees C, epsilon : 1.0 s(-1)), which presented the highest efficiency
   in hot working process, as well as the obtained fine microstructure
   after the hot processing. Via microstructure characterization and
   observation, it is concluded that the dynamic recrystallization (DRX)
   occurred at the PPBs in the P/M superalloy. The DRX and the strain rate
   sensitivity exponent m are both affected by true strain. The local DRX
   presents a relatively low m in a small strain compression. With an
   increase of strain, the fraction of the recrystallized grains increases
   with to. The global DRX. however, presents a relatively high m in a
   large strain compression. It is thus indicated that the superplasticity
   of FGH96 superalloy can be realized at a slow strain rate such as 0.001
   s(-1) and the deformation temperature of 1110 degrees C, near to the
   gamma'-transus temperature, by using the uniformly fine-grained
   superalloys as well as the high temperature superplastic forming
   equipment. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier B.V. All

   achieve suitable bonding of alumina to the substrate, a MCrAlY type bond
   coat is commonly applied to the metallic substrate and the subsequent
   formation of dense, adherent oxide(s) on the MCrAlY coating surface can
   ultimately determine the durability of the layered structure In this

AB The hot deformation behavior of a nickel-base superalloy prepared by
   powder metallurgy (P/M) was investigated by using isothermal constant
   strain rate compressing tests conducted in deformation temperature from
   1000 degrees C to 1100 degrees C and strain rate from 0.001 s(-1) to 1
   s(-1). The true stress-true strain curves show that the alloy has higher
   strength at the temperature of 1000 degrees C. The processing maps for
   hot working were established based on the variations of efficiency of
   powder dissipation with deformation temperature and strain rate,
   interpreted using dynamic material model (DMM). The processing maps
   demonstrate that strain markedly affected the instability regions. The
   efficiencies of powder dissipation obtained in the strain range from 0.1
   to 0.7 are essentially similar, which indicates that strain has a slight
   influence on it. The alloy exhibits a better workability in deformation
   temperature range from 1060 degrees C to 1100 degrees C and strain rate
   range from 1 x 10(-1.5)s(-1) to 1 x 10(-0.5)s(-1) owing to lower
   activation energy. Moreover, the fine recrystallized grain region can be
   identified on the basis of Zener-Hollomon parameter map at strain of
   0.6. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Due to the rapid melting and solidification in laser molten pool, the
   laser solid forming (LSF) samples have generally much finer
   microstructure than that of the conventional cast, and are also free of
   macrosegregation. To date, more and more researchers have reported the
   application of LSF technology in the forming of superalloy, which
   contains some easily segregated elements such as Nb, Ti and Al. To
   prevent the molten pool from oxidation, the LSF process usually should
   be performed within a protective atmosphere. But in practice, the
   forming of oxidation-resistant metals are always performed in the air
   atmosphere and only the molten pool is protected by noble gas.
   Therefore, it is important to investigate the microstructures and
   properties of LSF materials prepared in the air and noble gas. In the
   present study, the microstructures, tensile properties and high cycle
   fatigue properties of LSF Inconel 718 alloy samples prepared in the air
   and argon atmospheres were investigated. It is indicated that the
   microstructures in as-deposited and heat-treated LSF Inconel 718 alloy
   samples prepared in both atmospheres are similar. The as-deposited
   microstructure consists of columnar dendrites grew epitaxially along the
   deposition direction from the substrate, and changes to the equiaxed
   grains after solution heat treatment due to the recrystallization. The
   tensile properties of the two kinds of the samples after heat treatment
   reached the standard for wrought Inconel 718 alloy. The tensile strength
   of the sample prepared in air is slightly higher than that of the sample
   prepared in the argon atmosphere, and the high cycle fatigue lifetime of
   the latter is 30% higher than that of the former, which is related to
   the fewer defects such as micro pores and small size oxide inclusions
   existed in the former. The lower high cycle fatigue property of LSF
   Inconel 718 alloy than that of wrought Inconel 718 alloy is attributed
   to the metallurgical defects and the coarsening and uneven distribution
   of the recrystallized grains.

AB DZ417G is a directionally solidified (DS) superalloy developed for
   low-pressure blade applications in gas turbine engines The
   crystallization microstructures of DZ417G samples caused by
   sand-blasting and machining were investigated. The tensile properties of
   the alloy after crystallization were tested at room temperature and 900
   V and its stress-rupture performance was examined under conditions of
   980 degrees C/216 MPa and 760 degrees C/725 MPa The results show that
   after solution treatment equiaxed recrystallization grains form on the
   surface of specimens machined from directionally solidified alloy bars
   After aging treatment, cellular recrystallization takes place on the
   surface of specimens pretreated by sand blasting Both the yield strength
   and tensile strength at room temperature decrease after
   recrystallization, while those at 900 V are slightly affected by
   recrystallization. The recrystallization depth increases after
   stress-rupture tests, which may be attributed to migration of
   recrystallization boundaries driven by high temperature and stress. For
   samples without recrystallization microstructure, the fracture mode is
   transgranular, which is controlled by the propagation rate of the cracks
   initiated both on sum face and at inner microstructure discontinuities
   While for samples with recrystallization microstructure: the cracks
   prefer to be initiated on transverse recrystallization grain boundaries
   and propagate along the recrystallization boundaries into the matrix,
   which may accelerate the propagation rate TRF (transverse
   recrystallization area fraction) is a factor to evaluate the effect of
   recrystallization on the stress-ruptured performance The stress-ruptured
   performance is decreased with the increase of TRF between 0 and 0.5. For
   samples with a TRF of 0 5, second cellular recrystallization forms in
   the first equiaxed recrystallization grain The cracks mitated at
   interfaces of cellular microstructure have a high density, which impair
   the stress-ruptured performance of DZ417G alloy.

AB This paper characterizes the microstructure and mechanical properties of
   a nickel-based superalloy with a nominal composition of Ni-25Mo-8Cr
   (wt.%) after long-term exposures to elevated temperatures. The alloy is
   strengthened by long-range-ordered precipitates of an oI6 metastable
   phase with the Ni-2(Mo,Cr) stoichiometry. The alloy was annealed at 650
   degrees C for 1000, 2000 and 4000 h, after it had been plastically
   deformed in order to accelerate diffusion processes occurring at
   elevated temperature and consequently to ease the formation of stable
   phases. The microstructure was characterized using TEM, SEM and X-ray
   phase analyses; mechanical properties were measured in tensile tests.
   It has been determined that the alloy loses its phase stability upon
   plastic deformation and subsequent long-term annealing at 650 degrees C.
   The microstructure, composed initially of a dispersed Ni-2(Mo,Cr)
   strengthening phase in a Ni-based solid solution, decomposes during
   annealing into a mixture of Ni3Mo- and Ni4Mo-type phases, Mo-lean
   Ni-based solid solution and a complex intermetallic P phase. The
   dominant new phase is a plate-shaped Ni3Mo-type phase while the P phase
   appears as singular small precipitates. The Ni3Mo phase is formed mainly
   in regions of highly localized deformation, e.g., in shear bands, and
   only occasionally nucleates in regions where the deformation was
   relatively uniform (dislocations or twins in one system). Regions
   adjacent to the plates of the Ni3Mo phase are recrystallized and free
   from an Ni-2(Mo,Cr) strengthening phase. Changes in microstructure of
   the deformed alloy during long time annealing at 650 degrees C result in
   the decrease in the yield strength as well as tensile elongation at both
   room temperature and 650 degrees C. A significant decrease in elongation
   at 650 degrees C occurs only in specimens tested in air but not those
   tested in vacuum. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Inc.

   that had two kinds of sub-surface crystallographic orientations, < 100 >
   and < 110 >, were aluminized by the pack-cementation process at 1000
   degrees C for 5 h. To exclude the influence of the coating heat
   treatment on the creep strength of the bulk material, a set of specimens
   without coating was heat treated in vacuum at 1000 degrees C for 5 h,
   which was equivalent to the condition during aluminizing process, for
   comparisons the creep rupture test was carried out at 900 degrees C and
   392 MPa. The cross-sectional microstructures of the as-aluminized and
   creep rupture specimens were observed by SEM using the backscattered
   electron image mode (BSE) and TEM. Analysis indicated that creep
   strength of the aluminized samples was decreased by the formation of the
   inter-diffusion zone (IDZ) and the substrate diffusion zone (SDZ); both
   of them reduced the load bearing thickness, thus resulting an increase
   in the effective stress. Furthermore, it was found that the
   disappearance of the secondary precipitate during coating treatment also
   decreased the creep strength. The IDZ, which formed at the
   coating/substrate interface grew more rapidly on the {110} plane than
   that on the {100} plane because of the preferential growth of the
   Topological-Close Paced (TCP) phase. Ru addition on the substrate could
   enhance the creep strength and the SDZ formation between the
   IDZ/substrate interface.

   the effects of carburization on recrystallization of single crystal
   superalloy DD6 were investigated. The results showed that carbon was
   introduced into the grit blasted samples during carburization, producing
   a homogenous distribution of MC-type carbides in the form of submicron
   dispersed precipitates within the grit blasted region. These MC-type
   carbides hold back the recrystallized grain boundaries. As temperature
   increases, MC-type carbides dissolve and secondary M(6)C-type carbides
   precipitate. The interaction between these M(6)C-type carbides and
   recrystallized grain boundaries further hinders recrystallization. Thus
   the average depth of the recrystallization region and number of
   recrystallized grains observed in carburized grit blasted samples are
   less than those in the samples which underwent grit blasting process
   alone. Carburization can significantly reduce recrystallization in
   single crystal superalloy DD6 during solution heat treatment. (C) 2010

AB Ni base alloys such as IN617 are one of the preferred choices for steam
   turbine components used by fossil fuelled power generation plants. IN617
   is a solid solution strengthened Ni based superalloy containing similar
   to 23%Cr, 12%Co and 9%Mo with low content of precipitation strengthening
   elements Al, Ti and Nb. In the 'as received' (solution annealed
   condition), the microstructure consists of primary carbides (M23C6) and
   occasional TiN particles dispersed in a single phase austenitic matrix.
   Owing to high temperature exposure and the creep deformation processes
   that occur in service, evolution of the microstructure occurs. This
   results in secondary precipitation and precipitate coarsening, both on
   grain boundaries and intragranularly in areas of high dislocation
   density. The influence of creep deformation on the solution treated
   IN617 alloy at an operating condition of 650 degrees C/574 h, with
   emphasis on the morphology and distribution of carbide/nitride
   precipitation is discussed. The applied stress was at an intermediate

   cold-deformed by compression has been investigated. The effects of
   plastic strain, annealing temperature and annealing time have been
   studied, and recrystallization diagram has been obtained. It has been
   found that a very strong dependence upon temperature is evident. For the
   single crystal superalloy with 4.5% strain, full recrystallization has
   been observed when annealing at 1300 degrees C for 1h, surface
   recrystallization at 1250 degrees C for 1h, cellular recrystallization
   at 1150 degrees C for 1h and no recrystallization at 1100 degrees C for
   1h. With the drop of temperature, the volume fraction of gamma' phase
   increases, which incrementally restricts recrystallized boundary
   migration. With the increasing of annealing time or strain, the
   sensitivity of recrystallization increases. Recrystallization tendency
   of standard-heat-treated superalloy is weaker than that of as-cast
   single crystal superalloy, because standard heat treatment reduces the
   microsegregation, lowers the eutectic amount and forms homogeneous
   gamma' phase distribution, which decrease preferential nucleation site
   of recrystallized grain and increase the resistance of boundary
   migration of recrystallization.

AB As a precipitation hardened unidirectionally solidified Ni-based
   superalloy, DZ125 has been extensively applied as structural materials
   in advanced aeroengine for gas turbine blades and vanes operating at
   elevated temperatures. The solidification microstructure of alloy plays
   an important role in determining the alloy's mechanical properties. For
   a given alloy, the thermal history of alloy melt has an obvious
   influence on the final solidification microstructure. However, previous
   researches mainly focused on melt superheating temperature. There are
   few investigations about the influence of the relaxation process of
   alloy melt on the solidification structure. In this paper, under the
   same conditions of processing parameters, e.g., solid/liquid interface
   temperature gradient, withdrawing velocity, by changing the melt holding
   time, the relaxation phenomenon during melt superheating treatment of
   DZ125 was investigated. The melt was superheated to 1650 degrees C and
   kept for 30 min, and then it was rapidly cooled down to 1500 degrees C.
   In order to study the relaxation phenomenon during melt superheating
   treatment, the melt was held for 15, 30 and 60 min, respectively, and
   then was withdrawn into the Ga-In-Sn liquid metal bath at a rate of 50
   mu m/s. The results show that dendrite arm spacing, segregation ratios,
   size and morphology of gamma' phase and gamma+gamma' eutectic did not
   change with the increase of the holding time when melt holding time was
   less than 30 min. But, when melt holding time was prolonged to 60 min,
   the dendrite arm spacing, gamma+gamma' eutectic and the size of gamma'
   phase in interdendrite area increased, and the segregation becomes
   serious, but the gamma' phase on dendrite trunk was lightly refined. The
   morphology of MC carbide mainly showed disconnected blocky and nodule,
   and unchanged with the prolongation of holding time. These changes in
   solidification structure should be primarily attributed to the influence
   of relaxation process on melt structure. When the melt holding time was
   less than 30 min, there was no evidently change in melt structure. But,
   further prolonging melt holding time to 60 min, the melt structure had
   obvious variation. This variation affected the solidification processing
   and finally solidification structure. Therefore, the variation of melt
   holding time resulted in the change of solidification structure.

   treatment process on the rejuvenation of degraded first stage gas
   turbine nozzle microstructure and mechanical properties In fact,
   microstructural investigation of the degraded first stage nozzle
   revealed the presence of continuous film of carbides at the grain
   boundaries of the base material as a direct result of transformation of
   primary carbides M(6)C type to secondary carbides M(23)C(6) type In
   general, the presence of continuous film of carbides at the grain
   boundaries reduces ductility and toughness of the nozzle alloy as
   compared with the initial values and so facilitates crack initiation and
   propagation at the matrix/carbide interface contributing to the
   reduction of first stage gas turbine nozzle lifetime during
   start-up/shutdown of turbine However, internal service damage due to
   precipitate coarsening and changes in grain boundary carbides should
   generally be reversible with appropriate heat treatment involving
   solution treatment followed by controlled precipitation at lower
   temperatures For this purpose, the solution treatment was conducted at
   1230 degrees C for 3 h, followed by air cooling and finally aging
   treatment was done at 850 and 950 degrees C for 8, 16 and 24 h applied
   after solution treatment According to the obtained results, the optimum
   microstructure and mechanical properties were observed at 850 degrees C
   for 16 h. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB M-Cr-Al-Y (M=Ni and/or Co) coatings with the good comprehensive property
   among anti-oxidation, anti-corrosion and mechanical properties have been
   widely used for the protection for the gas turbine components. However,
   after a long-term thermal exposure to high temperature atmosphere in
   service, the coatings are rapidly degraded. The main cause is ascribed
   to the intensive element interdiffusion between the coating and the
   substrate. To suppress the interdiffusion, addition of a diffusion
   barrier (DB) is required at the interface of the overlayer and the
   substrate. However, M-Cr-Al-Y coating system with a ceramic diffusion
   barrier prepared by a conventional two-step arc ion plating (AIP) on the
   superalloy substrate would reduce the interfacial adhesive strength. In
   this paper, the multilayer system of Ni-Cr-Al-Y-Si overlayer with a DB
   and a bond coat (BC) was deposited on the DSM11 substrate by one-step
   AIP. The anti-oxidation property, the anti-diffusion ability of the
   barrier and the interfacial adhesive strength of the multilayer system
   were investigated. The results indicate that the multilayer can provide
   more effective protection for the DSM11 substrate than the single
   coating at high temperature. After 100 h thermal exposure at 1050
   degrees C. the surface Al2O3 scales are continuous, dense, and only very
   little amounts of alloy elements diffused from the substrate is detected
   in the overlayer. After 100 cyc cycles between 1050 degrees C and room
   temperature (RT), the barrier layer has still well adhesive to the
   overlayer and the substrate. The tensile adhesion test shows that the
   interfacial adhesive strength is 63.6 MPa for the annealed multilayer
   system, which is about 20 MPa higher than that of the coating system
   with a DB on the DSM11 substrate deposited by the two-step AIP. The
   one-step AIP method can increase the interfacial adhesive strength and
   improve the anti-oxidation performance of the multilayer with DB.

AB Diffusion brazing is a widely-used technology for the repair of cracks
   in hot section turbine components, mostly fabricated from nickel-based
   superalloys. However, the filling of wide cracks in the range of 100-300
   mu m is difficult since the precipitation of brittle secondary phases,
   which are formed by the conventionally used melting point depressants B
   and Si, leads to deteriorating mechanical properties. Therefore, new
   Ni-Mn-based braze alloys were developed which allow a very fast
   epitaxial healing of particularly wide cracks in single-crystalline
   components. As B and Si are replaced by Mn, the repair process can be
   significantly shortened since the epitaxial solidification is not
   completely controlled by diffusion but can also be controlled by
   cooling. Ni-Mn-based systems enhanced by Al, Cr and Ti were
   investigated. In this work an improved brazing cycle for the
   minimization of porosity within the braze gap as well as an enhanced
   heat treatment, which produces a gamma/gamma' microstructure very
   similar to the parent material, are presented. Results from tensile
   tests at room temperature and at 900 degrees C conducted on 300 mu m gap
   width samples are discussed.

AB The susceptibility of pre-weld heat treated laser beam welded IN 738
   superalloy to heat affected zone (HAZ) cracking was studied. A pre-weld
   heat treatment that produced the minimal grain boundary liquation
   resulted in a higher level of cracking compared to those with more
   intergranular liquation. This deviation from the general expectation of
   influence of intergranular liquation extent on HAZ microfissuring is
   attributable to the reduction in the ability of the base alloy to
   accommodate welding tensile stress that accompanied a pre-weld heat
   treatment condition designed to minimize intergranular liquation.
   Furthermore, in contrast to what has been generally reported in other
   nickel-based superalloys, a decrease in laser welding speed resulted in
   increased HAZ cracking in the IN 738, which can be attributed to
   exacerbated process instability at lower welding speeds. (C) 2010

   (temperature, strain rate and strain) and flow stress of IN625 alloy.
   Three variations of standard back propagation algorithm (Broyden,
   Fletcher, Goldfarb and Shanno quasi-Newton, Levenberg-Marquardt and
   Bayesian) are applied to train the model. The results show that, in this
   case, the best performance, minimum error and shortest converging time
   are achieved by the Levenberg-Marquardt training algorithm. Comparing
   the predicted values and the experimental values reveals that a well
   trained network is capable of accurately calculating the flow stress of
   the alloy as a function of the processing parameters. Sensitivity
   analysis revealed that temperature has the largest effect on the flow
   stress of the alloy being in good agreement with the metallurgical

   lifetime of a thermal barrier coated (TBC) AE-437A Ni base superalloy
   mostly employed for manufacturing compressor and stationary stator
   blades in aero turbines from accelerated creep tests in air at 800
   degrees C. Based on accelerated stress rupture properties, the TBC
   specimens had superior life in terms of rupture hours compared to that
   of the bare substrate as severe high temperature oxidation is likely the
   cause of the reduced lifetime of the bare substrate while accelerated
   creep experiments are carried out in an oxidizing environment. The
   effect of furnace thermal cycling on accelerated creep properties of the
   TBC samples at 70 MPa and 800 degrees C was also studied. It was
   observed that furnace thermal cycling (10 to 50, one hour thermal
   cycles) prior to creep loading, drastically reduces the rupture life of
   the TBCs. The life of thermal barrier coating prior to delamination and
   spallation is dominated by micro-cracking in both the thermally grown
   oxide and the yttria stabilized zirconia top coat. The damage generated
   by this micro-cracking is expected to be a primary life limiting factor.
   Delamination of top coat layer and bond coat from the substrate occurred
   at very high creep stress, whereas delamination of TBC from the bond
   coat was evident at intermediate creep stress level.

   withdrawal rate from 3 to 12 mm/min. However, higher withdrawal rate of
   15 mm/min induced the formation of stray grains. Size and volume
   fraction of the eutectics were found to decrease with the increasing in
   withdrawal rate. After solution heat treatment at 1250 degrees C,
   un-dissolved eutectic was observed in specimens. High temperature creep
   rupture life was observed to be very sensitive to the fraction of these

   showed that refined microstructure and low fraction of the remaining

AB High-temperature diffusion brazing is a very important technology for
   filling cracks in components from single-crystalline nickel-base
   superalloys as used in aircraft engines and stationary gas turbines:
   Alloys, which are similar to the base material, are enhanced by a fast
   diffusing melting-point depressant (MPD) like boron or silicon, which
   causes solidification by diffusing into the base material. Generally,
   epitaxial solidification of single-crystalline materials can be achieved
   by use of conventional braze alloys; however, very long hold times are
   necessary to provide a complete diffusion of the MPD out of the braze
   gap. If the temperature is lowered before diffusion is completed,
   brittle secondary phases precipitate, which serve as nucleation sites
   for stray grains and, therefore, lead to deteriorating mechanical
   properties. It was demonstrated in earlier works that
   nickel-manganese-based braze alloys are appropriate systems for the
   braze repair of particularly wide gaps in the range of more than 200 mu
   m, which allow a significant shortening of the required hold times. This
   is caused by the complete solubility of manganese in nickel: Epitaxial
   solidification can be controlled by cooling in addition to diffusion. In
   this work, it will be shown that the nickel-manganese-based systems can
   be enhanced by chromium and aluminum, which is with regard to
   high-temperature applications, a very important aspect. Furthermore, it
   will be demonstrated that silicon, which could be identified as
   appropriate secondary MPD in recent works, can be replaced by titanium
   as this element has additionally a gamma' stabilizing effect. Several
   braze alloys containing nickel, manganese, chromium, aluminum, and
   titanium will be presented. Previously, the influence of the above
   mentioned elements on the nickel-manganese-based systems will be
   visualized by thermodynamic simulations. Afterward, different
   compositions in combination with a heat treatment, which is typical for
   nickel-base superalloys, will be discussed: A microstructure, which is
   very similar to that within the base material, can be presented. [DOI:

AB ATI Allvac has recently developed Allvac (R) 718Plus (TM) (718Plus), a
   new class of nickel-base superalloy to be used in high temperature
   turbine engine applications. This new alloy has an in-service
   temperature capability that is 55 degrees C (100 degrees F) higher than
   Inconel 718 and has better processing characteristics, thermal
   stability, and lower raw material cost compared with other superalloys
   such as Waspaloy. The fatigue and creep-fatigue behaviour of three
   different microstructural conditions of 718Plus were investigated; the
   standard fine grain (ASTM 8 +/- 1) microstructure produced by the
   standard heat treatment, the standard fine grain microstructure after
   long term thermal exposure (732 degrees C for 1000 h), and a fine grain
   microstructure with modified delta-phase particles. All three conditions
   of 718Plus showed a significantly improved threshold for fatigue crack
   propagation over the widely used disc material, Waspaloy. This is an
   important material property for damage tolerant engine design as it
   indicates that 718Plus has a potentially higher application stress range
   for which cracks or defects are effectively non-propagating. Waspaloy
   showed better creep-fatigue crack growth resistance than the 718Plus
   materials but prolonged thermal exposure does improve this property
   considerably, making it comparable to Waspaloy.

   (H230) and Crofer 22 APU was investigated between 700 and 900 degrees C.
   The oxidation kinetics of the coated alloys was compared with that of
   base alloys at 800 degrees C. An apparent two-stage kinetics behavior of
   the MCO-coated Crofer 22 APU was observed. The coating effectively
   reduced the oxidation rate constants of Crofer 22 APU by 5.5 times,
   whereas it did not seem to affect the oxidation kinetics of H230. The
   oxidation activation energies of the coated alloys suggest distinctly
   different oxidation mechanisms between the coated H230 and Crofer 22
   APU. A Cr-modified spinel was observed in the interface region between
   the metal oxide scale and the spinel coating after long-term oxidation
   for both alloys. A semiquantitative model of oxidation kinetics was
   developed to explain the different behaviors observed. Apparently, the
   Cr-modified spinel may play a more important role on H230 during
   long-term oxidation. The heat-treatment of H230 in the reducing
   environment used for the MCO coating application processes appeared to
   debit oxidation resistance of the base alloy. The optimization of the
   MCO application process is expected to benefit oxidation resistance as
   well as chromia containment on H230. (C) 2010 The Electrochemical

   standard heat-treated commercial nickel base superalloy IN 738. In
   addition to M5B3 borides and M23C6 carbides, the precipitates were found
   to also consist of particles of M2B-type boride phase, which is
   previously unreported in the alloy and rarely reported in nickel base
   superalloys. The M2B borides exhibited a dual crystallographic
   structure: body centered tetragonal and face centered orthorhombic.
   Analyses of electron diffraction patterns and high-resolution
   transmission electron microscopy images indicated that both crystal
   structures can co-exist in a single M2B particle as an inter-growth with
   the formation of planar defects. Crystallographic relationship between
   microconstituent phases in the heat-treated alloy were elucidated and
   the influence of the borides on resistance to grain boundary liquation
   cracking during high-temperature material processing, such as laser beam
   treatment, is discussed.

AB Research on the behavior of high-purity, low-density (85%) air plasma
   sprayed (APS) thermal barrier coatings (TBC) with NiCoCrAlY bond coats
   deposited by argon-shrouded plasma spraying is described. The
   microstructure of the APS topcoats is one variable in this study
   intended to maximize the coating thicknesses that can be applied without
   spallation and to minimize the thermal conduction through the YSZ layer.
   The specimens were evaluated using cyclic oxidation tests and important
   properties of the TBCs, such as resistance to sintering and phase
   transformation, were determined.
   The high purity resulted in top coats which are highly resistant to
   sintering and transformation from the metastable tetragonal phase to the
   equilibrium mixture of monoclinic and cubic phases. The porous topcoat
   microstructure also resulted in significant durability during thermal
   cycling. The actual failure mechanisms of the APS coatings were found to
   depend on topcoat thickness, CTE of the superalloy substrate and the
   nature of the thermal exposure. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Superalloy Inconel 718 is an important material used for aero-engine
   high temperature turbine disks. The grain refining of Inconel 718
   becomes critical because of the improvement in the quality and
   reliability of aero-engine. Inconel 718 turbine disks are manufactured
   by multi-stage hot deformation processes, in which the recrystallized
   grain grows up in next passes. Therefore, it is difficult to obtain a
   uniform and refined microstructure by recrystallization refining. The
   delta phase in Inconel 718 can control grain size through the strong
   pinning effect. Thus, the Delta process (DP) has been applied for the
   forging of Inconel 718. In this paper, for the DP of Inconel 718, the
   evolution of delta phase during isothermal compression deformation at
   temperature of 950 degrees C and strain rate of 0.005 s(-1), was studied
   by using optical microscope (OM), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and
   quantitative X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique. The results show that
   spherical or rod-shaped delta phase particles in the interior of grains
   precipitated in the aging treatment disappear during the heating and
   holding time before deformation, and the content, of delta phase
   decreases from 8.14% to 7.05%. Dissolution of delta phase occurs during
   the deformation, and the content of delta phase decreases from 7.05% to
   5.14%. The spheroidization of plate-like or needle-like delta phase
   takes place due to the effect of deformation and dissolution breakages,
   and the plate-like or needle-like delta phase transferrs to spherical or
   rod-shaped delta phase. In the centre with the largest strain, the
   plate-like or needle-like delta phase disappears and spherical or
   rod-shaped delta phase appears in the interior of grains and grain
   boundaries.

AB The mechanical properties of a MCrAlY coating significantly influence

   convenient method for evaluating the mechanical properties of sprayed
   coatings by lateral compression of a circular tube coating. This method
   does not need chucking, and manufacturing the free-standing coating is
   quite straightforward. In this study, the mechanical properties of the
   free-standing CoNiCrAlY coatings prepared using low-pressure plasma
   spraying (LPPS), high-velocity oxyfuel (HVOF) spraying, and atmospheric
   plasma spraying (APS) were systematically measured with the lateral
   compression method at room temperature through to 920 A degrees C. The
   effect of postspray thermal treatments, in vacuum and in air, on the
   mechanical properties was investigated in the 400 to 1100 A degrees C
   temperature range. It was found that high-temperature thermal treatment
   in air was effective in increasing the bending strength and Young's
   modulus. It was especially effective on the APS coatings, which were
   produced using powders with average size 60 mu m, and on HVOF coating,
   whose bending strengths increased by approximately three times. On the
   contrary, the enhancement in the LPPS and APS coatings produced with
   powders 21 mu m in size was found to be approximately 1.6 times.

   respectively) and a sequential increase in the barothermal treatment
   (BTT) temperature from 1235 to 1320 degrees C. The BTT temperature is
   found to significantly affect the chemical composition of the carbides,
   and this effect manifests itself in an increase in the titanium,

   chromium content. The granulomteric composition of the carbide skeleton
   in the alloy is studied: it is found to depend substantially on the

   C eliminated the gamma-Ni5Zr eutectic peak on DTA curve. Only 5 h
   annealing at 1100 degrees C eliminated the gamma-gamma' eutectic in the

   gamma ->gamma' transformation temperature peak (gamma solvus). Annealing
   shifted they gamma ->gamma' peak to lower temperatures. Based on SEM/EDS
   analysis, annealing increased the zirconium content of dendrite regions
   to 1.5 wt.% in the expense of elimination of high Zr content gamma-Ni5Zr
   eutectic structure, but had no significant effect on the zirconium

   after heat treatment states were analyzed by OM, SEM and XRD. The
   tensile, rupture and hot corrosion resistance properties of DZ68 alloy
   were compared with DZ125 and IN738 alloys. Results show that the
   microstructure of as-cast DZ68 alloy is composed of gamma, gamma',
   (gamma+gamma') eutectics, MC type carbides and a few borides. After heat
   treatment, the microstructure of DZ68 alloy is composed of gamma, gamma'
   and carbides. The carbides are mainly MC and M23C6. The tensile strength
   of DZ68 alloy decreases slightly with the increase of temperature, and
   reaches its minimum value at 700 degrees C. When the temperature is
   higher than 700 degrees C, the tensile strength increases so evidently
   that reaches its maximum at once at 760 degrees C, But when the
   temperature is higher than 760 degrees C its tensile strength decreases
   obviously. It is well recognized the relationship of the tensile
   strength of DZ68 alloy with temperature is abnormal, similar to that of
   its yield strength but opposite to that of its plasticity. The tensile
   and rupture properties of DZ68 alloy are nearly the same as those of
   DZ125 alloy and its hot corrosion resistance property is nearly the same
   as that of IN738 alloy under the same conditions.

   phases. The size of the both phases increased with the increase in heat
   treatment time. beta phase near the BC/substrate interface disappeared
   during the heat treatment. This may be due to the diffusion of Al from
   the BC layer to the substrate and diffusion of Ni from substrate to BC
   layer. Yield stress of the BC layer decreased and interface delamination
   strain energy release rate Gamma(i) increased with the increase in the
   heat treatment time. The increase of Gamma(i) may be attributed to the
   increase of the size of the process zone ahead of the delamination front
   due to the decrease in yield stress of BC layer.

AB In this study, hot forging process of Co-Ni-Cr-Mo superalloy was carried
   out at temperatures ranging from 950 to 1200 degrees C and strain rates
   ranging from 0.01 to 30s(-1). In order to obtain an optimum forging
   condition, various processing maps were constructed, such as it power
   efficiency map and an instability map, at different strain levels on the
   basis of a dynamic material model. At a strain of 0.5, temperatures
   1050-1200 degrees C and strain rates of 10-30s(-1), dynamic
   recrystallization was observed with power efficiency values ranging from
   35 to 44%. Flow localization due to dynamic strain aging and/or
   deformation twinning at temperatures 950-1000 degrees C and at low
   strain rates were observed to be in good agreement with those observed
   in the instability map. [doi:10.2320/matertrans.M2009103]

AB The niobium alloy Nb-5.4 At% Hf-2 At% Ti is an important structural
   material used for high temperature applications. It is commonly produced
   in the form of sheet; however, it is also available in other mill forms.
   The sheets are vacuum-annealed to improve the formability prior to
   fabricating different components out of them through metal forming.
   Annealing in vacuum is adopted in view of the high proneness to
   oxidation of niobium- base materials. In the present instance vacuum
   annealing, of a sheet of the niobium alloy was carried out at 1175
   degrees C: a plate of the nickel-base superalloy 600 was used as charge
   support. It was noticed that the vacuum annealing, resulted in melting
   of the charge as well as the charge support material. The plate of
   superalloy 600 was then re-placed by a sheet of commercially pure
   titanium and next trial of annealing heat treatment carried out; there
   was no problem of melting. Failure analysis was carried out. The
   analysis brings out how phase diagrams can be used to choose the right
   material for supporting the charge in order to prevent melting during
   heat treatment. The failure is very expensive, if the material to be
   heat treated is costly, as it happens to be in the present case.

AB The relationship between thermo-mechanical processing, resultant
   microstructure, and mechanical properties has been of interest in the
   field of metallurgy for centuries. In this work, the effect of heat
   treatment on microstructure and key mechanical properties important for
   turbine rotor design has been investigated. Specifically, the tensile
   yield strength and crack growth resistance for a nickel-iron based
   superalloy 706 has been examined. Through a systematic study, a
   correlation was found between the processing parameters and the
   microstructure. Specifically, differences in grain boundary and grain
   interior precipitates were identified and correlated with processing
   conditions. Further, a strong relationship between microstructure and
   mechanical properties was identified. The type and orientation of grain
   boundary precipitates affect time-dependent crack propagation
   resistance, and the size and volume fraction of grain interior
   precipitates were correlated with tensile yield strength. It was also
   found that there is a strong environmental effect on time-dependent
   crack propagation resistance, and the sensitivity to environmental
   damage is microstructure dependent. Microstructures with eta decorated
   grain boundaries were more resistant to environmental damage through
   oxygen embrittlement than microstructures with no eta phase on the grain
   boundaries. An effort was made to explore the mechanisms of improving
   the time-dependent crack propagation resistance through
   thermo-mechanical processing, and several mechanisms were identified in
   both the environment-dependent and the environment-independent category.
   These mechanisms were ranked based on their contributions to crack
   propagation resistance.

AB This paper describes some technical limitations encountered in joining

   strength of joints fabricated between alumina-alumina or alumina and the
   nickel base alloy HAYNES(A (R)) 214 (TM) using a solid-state bonding
   technique with Ni interlayer was studied. Finite element analyses (FEA)
   for the elastic-plastic and elastic-plastic-creep behavior have also
   been used to better design the joints and to predict their performance.
   It was found that the residual stresses caused by the thermal expansion
   mismatch between alumina (Al(2)O(3)) and the Ni-based superalloy
   (HAYNES(A (R)) 214 (TM)) have severely deteriorated the joints compared
   to Al(2)O(3)-Al(2)O(3) joint fabricated with the same solid-state
   bonding parameters. The high residual stresses zones obtained through
   the FEA simulation fitted well with the fractographic observations of
   the Al(2)O(3)/Ni/HAYNES(A (R)) 214 (TM) joints. Also, in order to use
   the joint material as a structural material, the study about the effect
   of geometrical parameters has been performed. Optimal geometries have
   been determined.

   uniform coarse grains increase resistance against creep deformation. The

   while dynamic recrystallization effect became dominant at 1000 degrees
   C. Dynamic recrystallization was observed in all the creep deformed
   foils, even though some specimens had already been (statically)
   recrystallized during annealing. Steady state creep rates decreased with
   increasing annealing temperature in the less rolled foils. The apparent
   activation energy Q(app) for the creep deformation increased from 271 to
   361 kJ/mol as the annealing temperature increased from 950 to 1100

   s(-1). At lower strain rates (<= 0.1 s(-1)), the flow curves exhibited a
   peak stress characteristic followed by a steady-state flow stress at
   large strains while continuous flow softening occurred at higher strain
   rates. The stress exponent value of 5.56 and apparent activation energy
   of 456 kJ/mol was calculated by a standard kinetic equation over the
   entire range of temperatures and strain rates. The power dissipation map
   exhibited a single domain in the temperature range 1050-1200 degrees C
   and strain rate range 0.01-0.001 s(-1) with a peak efficiency of about
   44% occurring at 1200 degrees C and 0.001 s(-1). Microstructural
   observations revealed that this domain represented dynamic
   recrystallization (DRX) and must be the optimum conditions for hot
   working the material. As predicted by continuum criterion, flow
   instabilities occurred in the form of adiabatic shear bands when
   deformed at strain rates above 0.1 s(-1) and at temperatures below 1000

   interface. In the case of coupons annealed in air at 1000 degrees C
   after the coating/IBM processing, severe interdiffusion from some of the
   proactive species into the coating and towards the substrate were found.
   The surfaces and the interfaces of the as-deposited coupons were
   characterized by in oxidation that was found to increase as a result of

AB Recently, a large local stress has been found, caused by the change of
   both the diffusion rate of oxygen through an existing oxide and the rate
   of chemical reaction at the oxide/oxidized material interface. Since
   high thermal stress occurs in the thermal barrier coating (TBC) system,
   the volume expansion of the newly grown oxide, and centrifugal force,
   the growth rate of the thermally grown oxide (TGO) may change depending
   on the temperature, the exposure time, and the stress. The aim of this
   study is to make clear the influence of stress on the growth rate of the
   TGO thickness under static oxidation. The results show that TGO
   thickening was affected by the increase of not only the exposure
   temperature but also the applied stress. The tensile stress in a
   longitudinal direction in a TBC system due to the applied load makes the
   oxidant transport and oxide flow more easy, i.e., the tensile stress
   promotes a volume expansion of newly formed oxide. The increase rate of
   the TGO thickness was approximately 34% when the applied stress
   increased from 0 to 205 MPa at 900 degrees C for 325 h, and
   approximately 25% when the stress increased from 0 to 150 MPa at 950
   degrees C for 125 h. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Mechanical properties (Young's modulus E, hardness H, degree of

   prepared by electron beam physical vapour deposition (EB PVD), have been
   investigated by nanoindentation. The power-law exponents n and m,

   curves, increase with peak load for the yttrium-stabilized zirconia top
   coat (TC), containing 4 mol% Y(2)O(3), and the NiCoCrAlY bond coat (BC).
   The variations of m are correlated to the degree of plasticity. Decrease
   of the hardness with increasing peak load, generally known as
   indentation size effect (ISE), is observed only for the TC and the BC.
   The ISE in the TC is explained using a new empirical equation based on
   the concept of elastic recovery. The average Young's moduli of the
   Ni-based superalloy, substrate, the BC and the TC are 189 +/- 11 GPa,
   166 +/- 7 GPa, and 126 +/- 25 GPa, respectively. The corresponding
   average hardness values are 3.3 +/- 0.3 GPa, 5.5 +/- 0.2 GPa, and 6.2

   complex behaviour upon annealing at 1000 degrees degrees C in air, which
   can be explained by changes in the porosity and the residual stresses.

   mechanical properties and surface stability. Chrome nickel steel and a
   few nickel based superalloys samples were exposed to the laser beam
   before creep deformation process. The second group of nickel based

   techniques. Hot corrosion of normal NiCoCrAlYSiB and the gradient
   coating in pure Na2SO4 and Na2SO4/NaCl (75:25, wt./wt.) salts was
   performed at 900 degrees C in static air. The corrosion results
   indicated an enhanced corrosion resistance to both salts for the
   gradient NiCoCrAlYSiB coating, which the improved performance of it
   should be attributed to the beta aluminide "pool" at the surface layer.
   By partially sacrificing Al2O3 (i.e. Al), the gradient NiCoCrAlYSiB
   coating specimen behaved excellently in the two kinds of salts. The
   grain growth during the gaseous phase aluminisation and the corrosion
   mechanism, including the role NaCl played in the mixture salt corrosion,

   coating on three different superalloys namely Superni 75. Superni 718
   and Superfer 800H at 900 degrees C for 100 cycles in air under cyclic
   heating and cooling conditions has been investigated in the present
   work. The kinetics of oxidation of coated and bare superalloys was
   analysed, using thermogravimetric technique. It was observed that all
   the coated and bare superalloys obey a parabolic rate law of oxidation.
   X-ray diffraction, FE-SEM/EDAX and X-ray mapping techniques were used to
   analyse the oxidation products of coated and bare superalloys. The
   results on the Cr3C2-NiCr-coated superalloys showed better oxidation
   resistance due to the formation of a compact and adhesive thin Cr2O3
   scale on the surface of the coating during oxidation. The scale remained
   intact and adherent to the partially oxidised coating during cyclic
   oxidation due to its good compatibility and similar thermal expansion
   coefficient between Cr3C2-NiCr coating and the superalloy substrates. In
   all the coated superalloys, the chromium, iron, silicon and titanium
   were oxidised in the inter-splat region, whereas splats which consisted
   mainly of Ni remained unoxidised. The parabolic rate constants of
   Cr3C2-NiCr-coated alloys were lower than that of the bare superalloys as
   observed in the present work. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   K465 by arc ion plating technique. The oxidation behaviors of the
   composite coating and the reference coating NiCoCrAlYSiB were
   investigated. The results show that the outer layer of composite coating
   consists of beta-(Ni, Co)Al and dispersed sigma-NiCoCr and Cr3Si, and
   the inner layer of composite coating consists of Cr-rich phases and
   minor beta-(Ni, Co)Al after vacuum annealing at 1050 degrees C. Because
   of the excessive consumption of Al, the spinels and NiO are formed on
   the surface of the reference coating. For the composite coating, the
   protective alumina scale is continuous and dense. The enhanced oxidation
   resistance of the composite coating is related to the gradient
   distributions of Al-enriched outer layer and Cr-enriched inner layer.

   results indicate that the microstructure of DZ68 alloy is more uniform
   than K438 alloy after heat treatment. There are small size carbides in
   the microstructure of DZ68 alloy after heat treatment, but there are big
   size carbides and a lot (gamma + gamma') eutectic in the microstructure
   of K438 alloy. The hot corrosion of DZ68 alloy is uniform, and the
   corrosion products are mainly (Ni, Co)Cr2O4 and Al2O3, More (Ni,
   Co)Cr2O4 exists in outer corrosion layer and more Al2O3 exists in inner
   corrosion layer. For the K438 alloy the hot corrosion is not uniform,
   NiO is the mainly corrosion product in outer corrosion layer and CrS is
   the main corrosion product in inner corrosion layer, Moreover, the
   segregation of Ti can induce segregation of other elements in the two
   alloys, which leads to a severe local corrosion of alloys. Under the
   same experimental condition, the corrosion resistance of DZ68 alloy is a
   little better than that of K438 alloy.

   measurements have been carried out for coatings attached to zirconia
   substrates, and these experimental data are compared with model
   predictions. The model is then used to explore the influence of the
   substrate material (zirconia vs. a nickel superalloy), and of the
   in-plane coating stiffness. Both differential thermal expansion stresses
   and tensile stresses arising from the constraint imposed on in-plane
   shrinkage can be relaxed via two diffusional mechanisms: Coble creep and
   microcrack opening. This relaxation allows progression towards
   densification. although the process is somewhat inhibited, compared with
   the case of a free-standing coating. Comparison of the stored elastic
   strain energy with the critical strain energy release rate for
   interfacial cracking allows estimates to be made of whether debonding is

AB The present paper is concerned with the development of multiscale
   modelling approaches for predicting the microstructural evolution and
   high temperature deformation characteristics of superalloys with special
   attention to creep and hot forming behaviour. A microstructure informed
   deformation model is presented that links rearrangements at the
   microscale to the overall macroscopic response of the material through a
   damage mechanics approach and results are presented on the application
   of the model to CMSX4. The control of microstructure, during the
   manufacture of nickel based superalloy components, is key to the
   development of the mechanical properties required for the high
   temperature applications typical of these materials. Results from
   empirical methods and a new physics based approach for modelling
   recrystallisation in polycrystalline superalloys are presented for the
   prediction of the grain size distributions produced during hot forming
   operations in Inconel alloy 718. A global macroscale modelling approach
   based on Neural Networks has been developed which includes the effects
   of composition, heat treatment and processing route and the
   effectiveness of the model for both property prediction and
   interpolation is demonstrated.

   precipitates remains near spherical even after long aging times.
   Compositional variation, observed between small (< 5 nm) and larger
   gamma' precipitates, reduces with increasing aging time, while the
   compositional gradient across the gamma/gamma' interface decreases. The
   process of growth of c gamma' precipitates seems to occur through
   coalescence of adjacent gamma' precipitates, facilitated through the
   formation of "necks'' between adjacent precipitates. These necks are
   observed to have intermediate elemental concentration values between the
   matrix and the gamma' precipitate compositions.

   secondary solidi. cation constituents MC carbides and sulfocarbides,
   which were all present in the preweld heat-treated alloy. Liquation of
   these particles embrittled the grain boundaries in the heat-affected
   zone (HAZ) and caused microfissuring along the liquated grain
   boundaries. Nevertheless, contrary to the generally observed increase in
   HAZ cracking in superalloys with an increase in Ti and Al concentration,
   due to increase in the alloy's hardness, significantly reduced cracking
   was observed in DS Rene ' 80 compared to the conventionally cast IN738
   welded under the same conditions, despite its hardness being higher than
   that of IN738. This was related to the nature of base-metal
   grain-boundary intersections at the fusion-zone boundary in these

   absence of applied stress, the factors associated with microstructural
   instability of the alloy include the coarsening of gamma', the formation
   of sigma and mu phase, the precipitation of P phase from sigma phase,
   the formation of M23C6 from decomposed MC, and the precipitation of
   M23C6 in gamma matrix. The sigma phase nucleates in the gamma matrix or
   on M23C6 carbides that form during aging, with the last stage of growth
   involving interactions with gamma'. The nucleation and growth of sigma
   phase in the absence of applied stress are discussed in terms of
   structural analysis, activation energy, and elemental distribution. In
   the condition of under applied stress, when the superalloy exhibits a
   rafted gamma' morphology after long-term exposure, the microstructure is
   free of sigma phase until the samples are plastically strained to
   fracture; however, a larger number of small new nucleated gamma'
   precipitates are observed in gamma channels when gamma' particles remain
   cubic shape with sharp corners under the condition of high applied
   stress. In addition, the alloy shows formation of sigma phase in this
   situation. The formation of sigma phase as well as the formation of
   small spherical gamma' is discussed in terms of energy dynamics. (C)

   in the meantime M23B6 + gamma and MB+gamma eutectics formed in the bond
   center and the fine M3B2 phases occurred in the diffusion zone. The
   gamma' phases both in the bonded interlayer and in the superalloy
   substrate are almost identical after homogenization treatment. Due to
   the epitaxial growth of the isothermal solidification fronts from each
   mating surface, the crystallographic orientation between the bonded
   interlayer and the bonded substrate has a good match.

AB The relationship between internal stress and thermomechanical fatigue
   (TMF) in a Ni-based single-crystal superalloy is studied by neutron and
   X-ray diffraction. The extents of internal stress, deformation, lattice
   mismatch, and distortion during TMF are characterized by the determined
   deviatoric stress invariants and lattice parameters and compared with
   relevant microstructural information from scanning electron microscopy
   (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results show that,
   in general, the macroscopic stress, plastic deformation, lattice
   mismatch, and distortion have all increased during TMF. The lattice
   mismatches of the TMF samples are at a high level, where the values
   along [100]/[010] are negative, but those along [001] are positive. The
   tetragonal lattice distortion of the gamma matrix is slightly greater
   than that of the gamma' precipitates, where the c/a values of the gamma
   matrix are smaller than 1, but that of the gamma' precipitate larger
   than 1. The gamma matrix yields and becomes hardened at the initial TMF
   cycle and gradually loses most of its strength during the earlier TMF
   cycles, associated with stress relaxation and homogenous deformation.
   However, the gamma' precipitates yield and become hardened later,
   bearing the most stress up to the necking of the superalloy. This
   process is associated with a buildup of stress and significant
   concentrated and inhomogeneous distribution of deformation in the gamma'
   precipitate. The residual deformation states of the superalloy and its
   component phases at the earlier TMF are basically shearing, and only
   become stretched at a later stage of TMF. The microstructure of the TMF
   samples shows an initial stage of rafting, where the dislocations are
   accumulated at the interfaces of the gamma matrix channels, but both
   dislocation networks and stacking faults are inhomogeneously distributed
   in the gamma' precipitates.

   Ni-base superalloy IN 100 at 650 degrees C. This model has the
   capability to capture first order effects on the stress-strain response
   due to (a) grain size, (b) gamma' precipitate size distribution, and (c)
   gamma' precipitate volume fraction. Experimental fatigue data with
   variable strain rates are used to calibrate the model for several
   distinct IN 100 microstructures (grain size, precipitate size
   distributions and volume fractions) obtained from thermomechanical
   processing. Physically based hardening laws are employed to evolve the
   dislocation densities for each slip system, taking into consideration
   the dislocation interaction mechanisms.
   The calibrated crystal plasticity model is used to inform microstructure
   dependent parameters of a macroscopic internal state variable (ISV)
   model, which is computationally feasible for use in component scale
   notch root analyses. A hierarchical methodology is outlined to embed
   this microstructure-dependence in the macroscale model. (C) 2008

AB Both directional and isothermal annealing experiments have been

   Directional annealing of MA 754 produced an elongated, coarse grain
   structure with a {110} < 100 > texture for all hot-zone velocities
   examined, with the grain aspect ratio and twin boundary density
   decreasing with increasing hot-zone velocity. Isothermal annealing also
   produced elongated structures, but with larger grain aspect ratios and a
   stronger {110} < 100 > texture. In order to elucidate the results of the
   experimental studies, a front-tracking computer-based model [H.J. Frost,
   C.V. Thompson, C.L. Howe, J.H. Whang, Scripta Metall. 22 (1988) 65-70]
   was modified to Simulate the directional/isothermal annealing processes
   for materials with particles. Simulations of directional annealing with
   particles aligned in the direction of hot-zone movement could produce
   (at the appropriate hot-zone velocities) columnar grain structures with
   some finer grains clustered around the particles. Contrary to
   experimental observations, simulations of isothermal annealing in
   similar particle-containing material did not produce columnar grain
   structures, but equi-axed grains whose size was defined by the spacing
   between the lines of particles. Thus, the simulation results suggest
   that it is the texture, and not the particles, of the hot-rolled MA 754
   that leads to a columnar grain structure. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All

   close packed phases, most probably sigma and mu. Close to the surface of

AB Thermomechanical fatigue (TMF) in a < 0 0 1 > oriented nickel base
   single crystal TMS-82 superalloy was studied in an effort to clarify the
   mechanisms of stress relaxation and failure. Detailed observations of
   the microstructural evolution from the interior and outer surfaces of
   the specimens after TMF tests were made using transmission electron
   microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and optical microscopy. The
   stress relaxation took place during a hold time in compression at 900
   degrees C, and the associated mechanisms varied with the following
   cycles. During TMF cycling, three stages of stress relaxations were
   identified: (1) primary stress relaxation; (2) steady stress relaxation;
   and (3) tertiary stress relaxation; each stage exhibits a distinct
   microstructural evolution. The first stage is related to the filling of
   dislocations in the gamma channels; the second stage involves
   dislocation annihilation; and the final stage is associated with the
   de-twinning of deformation twins. The main crack was found to originate
   from the intersection of deformation twin plates with the specimen
   surface, and oxidation then assists the growth of the crack. The stress
   concentration at the crack tip results in a high density of deformation
   twins, and the propagation of the crack along the twin boundaries can
   lead to TMF failure of the specimen. (C) 2008 Acta Materialia Inc.

AB In this investigation, solution and double ageing treatment is adopted
   to improve the elongation of MAR-M247 superalloy. A gamma'-film. is
   generated around the script-like carbides within the grain interior and
   around the particulate carbides at grain boundary (GB). The gamma'-film
   can protect the carbide interface, and accommodate the interface stress
   state to toughen the superalloy. Therefore its elongation can be
   increased not only at 1172 K, but also in the creep test at 1033 K/724
   MPa. However, the tensile strength is slightly reduced because the
   gamma'-phase becomes coarse. Hence, applying solution and double ageing
   treatment to MAR-M247 superalloy can efficiently enhance the MAR-M247
   superalloy's ductility at high temperature, and make its casting more
   reliable. It can therefore be used in a heat treatment process for
   toughening the superalloy. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Gas atomised and water atomised nickel base superalloy powders having
   compositions close to standard Nimonic 90 were MIM processed and
   sintered in a PADS (plasma assisted debinding and sintering) reactor
   under argon at 1280-1310 degrees C. A single, integrated
   debinding-sintering cycle of just under 10 h consistently yielded parts
   of >98% density that did not require hipping to achieve mechanical
   properties typical of heat treated wrought Nimonic 90 components. The
   best overall results were attained with the water atomised material
   sintered at lower temperatures. These results are particularly relevant
   to the development of turbine components for the automotive and
   aerospace industries.

AB The Ni-base superalloy UDIMET 500 indicates good hot corrosion
   resistance, high stability and strength at high temperatures and for
   this reason the alloy is used in manufacturing of gas turbine hot
   components. UDIMET 500 is employed in manufacturing of the second stage
   blades of high-power gas turbines. The microstructure consists mainly,
   of austenitey-matrix and ordered and coherent y'precipitates and also
   carbides dispersed in the matrix. The alloy gains its appropriate
   microstructure and strength through precipitation hardening mechanism.
   The heat treatment cycle consists of three stages: homogenization,
   partial solution and aging. Heat treatment parameters such as: time and
   temperature of homogenization, partial solution and aging temperatures,
   and cooling rate from homogenization and solution temperatures affect
   the microstructure of the alloy. Among these parameters cooling rate
   from partial solution is the most effective. Therefore, in this research
   the effects of cooling rate on microstructure and mechanical properties
   such as: tensile, creep and hardness were investigated. For this
   purpose, six different cooling rates were applied on the cast UDIMET 500
   specimens after partial solution at 1080 degrees C for 4 h.
   Microstructures of the specimens then were studied using optical and
   electron microscopy. Tension and creep tests were performed at different
   conditions. It was found out that with increasing cooling rate the
   volume percent of the gamma' precipitates decreases. Also, it was shown
   that size, shape and volume fraction of primary gamma'-particles are
   largely influenced by the cooling rate following homogenization and
   partial solution treatments. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In order to clarify different manners of failure behavior for plasma
   sprayed thermal barrier coating (TBC) systems under the complicated
   modes of thermal-mechanical-chemical loadings, the stress rupture
   properties was evaluated in air and in high-temperature corrosive
   environment with relation to the failure analysis for two kinds of TBC
   systems produced by different bondcoat (BC) processing. CoNiCrAlY-BC was
   manufactured by a vacuum plasma spraying (VPS) or high velocity oxy-fuel
   (HVOF), and then the Y2O3-stabilized ZrO2 top-coat (TC) was made by an
   atmospheric plasma spraying (APS). After then, heat-treatment was
   adopted for the sprayed TBC specimens in pure argon atmosphere. TBC
   system with HVOF-BC was found to result in the almost equivalent rupture
   life to that of VPS-BC, because the compositional and microstructural
   modification; equalization, of the HVOF-BC was attained by the
   heat-treatment. Furthermore, it was found that the strength properties
   of both TBC systems depend strongly on the loading condition. Namely,
   the static creep loading was found to cause the almost similar rupture
   life to the no-coated substrate superalloy for both TBC systems
   regardless of the environmental condition. On the contrary, the dynamic
   fatigue and creep-fatigue loadings tend to bring about a significant
   rupture life reduction, since the penetration crack induced by the
   heat-treatment in the TC provides directly the nucleation site of the
   fatigue main crack.

   rate. Significant differences in the phase transformation temperatures
   were observed in DTA testing due to the withdrawal rates used to process
   the samples. After heat treatment, transformation temperatures,

AB Microstructural changes of chromium-modified alummide coating on
   IN-738LC superalloy under hot corrosion conditions were studied in this
   research. Samples were coated using two separate pack cementation
   processes, i.e. chromizing and aluminizing. Hot corrosion resistance of
   the coatings was evaluated using the furnace test method. For this
   purpose the specimens were coated with a thin layer of Na(2)SO(4)-5 wt%
   NaCl and then oxidized in air for a period of 1000 hours at 850 degrees
   C. The results of the hot corrosion test indicated that lower chromium
   content in the chromizing pack powder (C10A coating) resulted in the
   formation of a uniform adhesive surface oxide scale, containing mainly
   Al(2)O(3). However, the C20A coating with higher chromium content
   exhibited Cr(2)O(3) as a major surface oxide. The maximum depth of
   sulphur penetration in the C10A coating was 60 mu m, which was very low
   in comparison with that of the C20A coating (i.e. 350 pm). In addition,
   the distribution of elements and precipitates within the coatings and
   the substrate before and after the hot corrosion tests was analyzed.
   From this investigation, some suggestions were made for better hot
   corrosion resistance of the coatings.

   castability ( comparison between measured microsegregation and Scheil
   simulation), forgeability ( hot tensile ductility, strain hardening and

AB Thermal barrier coatings (TBC,) are applied on cooled gas turbine
   components. Between the heated and cooled surfaces a thermal gradient
   develops, resulting for constraint components in high multiaxial
   stresses, which may exceed stresses due to mechanical loading. In order
   to investigate the damage behaviour of TBC systems under close to
   reality conditions, thermal mechanical fatigue tests with controlled
   thermal gradients (TGMF-tests) were performed on coated tubular
   specimens. The specimen substrate was made from directionally solidified
   nickel base superalloy IN100 DS, and the coating system comprised a
   NiCoCrAlY bond coat and a ceramic top coat from partially stabilized
   zirconia. The stress distribution over the specimen wall, which was
   generated in the course of one TGMF cycle, has been analysed by linear
   elastic Finite Element calculations.
   In TGMF testing specific damages occurred underneath the adherent
   ceramic top coat, evolving into fatigue cracks, which propagated
   primarily in the metallic bond coat parallel to the surface. In length
   sections the crack shape in this stage resembles a 'smiley'. During
   further cycling the crack path deviated to the interface between BC and
   top coat, enhancing spallation. The 'smiley'-crack patterns, which only
   occurred in TGMF but not in isothermal low cycle fatigue or thermal
   fatigue, are discussed with respect to the cyclic local stress
   distribution. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB An innovative testing system, capable of testing miniature testpieces at

   of Nimonic 90, a nickel alloy. This alloy is being used for extensive
   validation testing to underpin a new European Code of Practice for TMF
   (thermomechanical fatigue) tests. This paper provides additional
   characterisation information using the miniature
   electro-thermomechanical test system (the ETMT) that has been developed
   at the National Physical Laboratory to obtain multiproperty data over a
   range of temperatures. The system uses DC electric current to heat
   rectangular cross-section testpieces. It has water cooling for the
   testpiece grips, a facility for inert gas supply to prevent sample
   oxidation, and full computer-control and digital data acquisition. In
   the present arrangement, strain is deduced by monitoring changes in
   resistance. Both thermal and mechanical loads can be cycled and a
   special program was written for conducting either IP or OP TMF tests.
   The system was used to obtain data on the variation of electrical
   resistivity with temperature and this data provided insight on the phase
   changes that occur in Nimonic 90 as a function of temperature. Uniaxial
   mechanical tests were performed at 400 and 850 degrees C, the
   temperature limits of the specified IMF cycle. Preliminary TMF tests
   were performed for comparison with the European interlaboratory testing
   exercise on macroscopic testpieces. The repeatability of miniature tests
   was good and the fracture mechanism appeared to be representative of
   deformation observed in macroscopic tests on the alloy. (C) 2007

   approximation. It is also able to reproduce experimental trends in the
   case of surface segregation of sulphur in a Ni superalloy. In the case
   of the grain boundary segregation of impurities (P or S) in engineering
   alloys, the present approach provides a practical tool, as it can be
   coupled to other finite element simulations (heat transfer and/or
   mechanics). Thus, it becomes possible to predict the risk of synergetic
   segregation and thermomechanical damage during service or processing

AB Thermomechnical fatigue (TMF) failure of Nimonic 90, a polycrystalline
   superalloy, has been investigated under out of phase (OP), in phase (IP)
   and counterclockwise (CCD) tests. The tests have been carried out in a
   temperature range of 400-850 degrees C and mechanical strain range of
   +/- 0-4%. One IP test has been carried out at a lower strain range of
   +/- 0.3%. The TMF lives are greatly affected by the TMF cycle profiles.
   The shortest TMF life was recorded for the IP test, whereas the longest
   was recorded for the OP test at the same strain level. Detailed
   investigation of the micromechanisms of deformation highlighted that
   gamma' coarsening rate during the IP test was much higher than the other
   tests and that this was consistent with a faster stress drop during the
   course of the TMF test. In addition the gamma' coarsening rate was
   greater for both tests than that occurring during simple thermal cycling
   of the alloy over the same temperature range but without load. However
   the more important factor determining the shorter life of the IP test
   compared with the OP test is related to the initiation and propagation
   of the failure crack in the two samples. The IP samples showed both
   initiation and propagation at grain boundaries while the OP test
   revealed grain boundary initiation followed by an intragranular
   propagation mode. Measurements conducted on the microcrack size revealed
   a much higher microcrack growth rate during the IP test. It is likely
   that the tensile strain during the high temperature part of the IP cycle
   accelerates oxygen diffusion and thus increases grain boundary oxidation
   at the tips of microcracks, shortening IP life.

   electroplating of Re(Ni) and Ni(W) films, Al- and Cr- (high-Cr and
   low-Cr) pack cementations, and a combination of the two treatments. With
   the ReW-high-Cr coating, fine needle- or plate-like precipitates formed
   in the alloy substrate below the inner Re(W, Cr, Ni) layer, while there
   was little of this precipitate with the ReW-low-Cr pack-cementation
   coating. The inner, Re-base alloy layer in the ReW-high-Cr coating was
   identified to be a sigma-(Re,Cr,W,Ni) phase, while the inner layer of
   the ReW-low-Cr was a mixture of sigma-(Re,Cr,W,Ni) and delta-Re(Cr,W,Ni)
   phases. After heating the coated alloys at 1,150 degrees C for 100 h in

   with alpha-Cr particles and fine precipitates of gamma'-Ni(3)Al with

   ReW-high-Cr coating there were numerous light-colored, needle-like
   precipitates formed deep in the alloy substrate under the inner layer,
   while in the case of the ReW-low-Cr coating gamma' appeared near the
   inner layer. It was found that the inner, Re-base alloy layer acted as a
   diffusion barrier, and that its structure was maintained with little
   change in composition after 100 h of oxidation at 1,150 degrees C.

AB The lifetime to initiate an engineering crack is usually predicted from
   S-N curves in high cycle fatigue or Coffin-Manson curves in low-cycle
   fatigue. This paper investigates how to predict the engineering life to
   initiate an engineering crack from the growth of small cracks. Small
   cracks can nucleate from defects and especially ceramic inclusions in
   superalloys produced by powder metallurgy. The behavior of short cracks
   nucleated from artificial defects was investigated under small scale
   yielding. A deterministic prediction of the life of smooth specimens was
   made using the growth law measured in air or in vacuum. The distribution
   of real defects was then used in a probabilistic life prediction model.
   The growth of small cracks under large scale yielding was investigated
   in stainless steels. A modified Tomkins equation can account for the
   behavior of small cracks and provide an estimate of the lifetime under
   low-cycle fatigue or thermal fatigue. A damage model based on the
   propagation of micro-cracks originating at casting defects has been
   developed for single crystal turbine blades, operating under
   thermo-mechanical creep-fatigue conditions. The model used the process
   zone concept introduced by Mc Clintock. Weakening of material due to
   localized oxidation embrittlement is shown to account for
   oxidation-creep-fatigue interactions. The model gives satisfactory life
   predictions under various thermo-mechanical loading conditions. A local
   approach to fracture is proposed for fatigue crack growth using a
   fracture criterion as a post-processor of a finite element model, for
   two-dimensional long cracks.

AB The microstructure of a laser beam welded directionally solidified
   Inconel 738 (DS IN738) superalloy was studied. The alloy was welded
   along the longitudinal (the solidification direction) and the transverse
   (perpendicular to solidification) direction in two pre-weld heat treated
   conditions. The material suffered intergranular microfissuring in the
   heat affected zone (HAZ); however, the centerline fusion zone cracking
   observed in most other directionally solidified or single crystal
   alloys, was not observed in any of the welded samples. The extent of HAZ
   microfissuring was observed to be significantly smaller in samples
   welded along the transverse direction compared to samples welded along
   the longitudinal direction which can be attributed to a fewer number of
   grain boundaries intersecting the weld bead in the transverse direction
   samples. The results indicated that in contrast to most reports on weld
   HAZ cracking, an increase in grain size produced by directional
   solidification processing can cause a decrease in grain boundary
   liquation cracking in crack susceptible nickel base superalloys.
   Cracking in the present directionally solidified (DS) IN738 was further
   reduced by the use of a recently developed overageing pre-weld heat
   treatment.

   about 1140 degrees C and 0.01 s(-1); the domain has its peak efficiency
   of about 36-41% for different strains. On the basis of hot deformation

AB CMSX-4 is a single-crystalline Ni-base superalloy designed to be used at
   very high temperatures and high mechanical loadings. Its excellent
   corrosion resistance is due to external alumina-scale formation, which
   however can become less protective under thermal-cycling conditions. The
   metallic substrate in combination with its superficial oxide scale has
   to be considered as a composite suffering high stresses. Factors like
   different coefficients of thermal expansion between oxide and substrate
   during temperature changes or growing stresses affect the integrity of
   the oxide scale. This must also be strongly influenced by the thickness
   of the oxide scale and the substrate as well as the ability to relief
   such stresses, e.g., by creep deformation. In order to quantify these
   effects, thin-walled specimens of different thickness (t = 100-500 mu m)
   were prepared. Discontinuous measurements of their mass changes were
   carried out under thermal-cycling conditions at a hot dwell temperature
   of 1100 degrees C up to 300 thermal cycles. Thin-walled specimens
   revealed a much lower oxide-spallation rate compared to thick-walled
   specimens, while thin-walled specimens might show a premature depletion
   of scale-forming elements. In order to determine which of these
   competetive factor is more detrimental in terms of a component's
   lifetime, the degradation by internal precipitation was studied using
   scanning electron microscopy (SEM) in combination with energy-dispersive
   X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). Additionally, a recently developed statistical
   spallation model was applied to experimental data [D. Poquillon and D.
   Monceau, Oxidation of Metals, 59, 409-431 (2003)]. The model describes
   the overall mass change by oxide scale spallation during thermal cycling
   exposure and is a useful simulation tool for oxide scale spallation
   processes accounting for variations in the specimen geometry. The
   evolution of the net-mass change vs. the number of thermal cycles seems
   to be strongly dependent on the sample thickness.

AB The kinetics of directional gamma' coarsening, known as rafting, are
   examined in the nickel based single crystal superalloy CMSX-4. Electron
   microscopy and image analysis are used to characterise heat treated
   specimens, prestrained in creep to a plastic strain beyond the threshold
   required to initiate rafting. The kinetics of rafting are found to be
   sensitive to the presence of microsegregation from casting, incompletely
   removed by the heat treatment process; thus the dendritic regions raft
   appreciably faster than the interdendritic ones-this despite rhenium
   enrichment at the dendrite cores consistent with its preferred
   partitioning during solidification. Estimates of the activation energy
   required for rafting in the two regions are established and Avrami-type
   equations developed. Since the important gamma' forming elements
   aluminium and tantalum are known to partition interdendritically causing
   an enhanced gamma' fraction, it is suggested that the correspondingly
   smaller gamma channel width so caused is responsible for the greater
   resistance to rafting displayed by the interdendritic regions.

   rate, which is attributed to time dependent damage mechanism such as
   oxidation. SEM observation revealed that the cracks initiated at the
   surface-connected carbides and/or casting micropores at subsurface. When

   homogenized at 1206 degrees C for I and 2 h. Microstructures of bonds

   Microstructure studies showed intermetallic compounds within the joint
   region. However, these intermetallic compounds were removed by a

   tests were undertaken to determine the mechanical properties of bonded
   samples. Results showed that the shear strength of bonds made under
   vacuum were higher than those of bonds made under argon atmosphere. The
   poor shear strength of bonds made under argon atmosphere was related to
   the formation of voids and porosities within the bond region and bond
   interface during bonding cycle. The variations of hardness within the
   joint region with bonding hold time and post-bond heat treatment time
   were discussed by considering the changes of alloying elements within

   gamma' particles and crystals given a compression pre-treatment to form
   a raft gamma' microstructure orientated parallel to the stress axis,
   were crept at 800 and 1000 degrees C. The analysis of the experiments
   show that, at 800 degrees C and 600 MPa, the alloy with cuboidal gamma'
   precipitates exhibited both lower creep rates and longer rupture lives
   compared to those with rafted gamma'. TEM examination showed that, in
   addition to {111} (110) -slip system operated in gamma matrix, the
   gamma' precipitates are cut by superlattice dislocations and stacking
   fault. It indicated that dislocations could shear the semi-coherent
   gamma' rafts relatively easily compared to the coherent cuboidal gamma'.
   At 1000 degrees C and 200MPa, the alloy with raft gamma' microstructure
   exhibited an extremely low minimum creep rate and longer rupture life.
   The dislocations movement by the combination of climbing and gliding
   processes and the glide-climb along gamma/gamma' vertical interfaces are
   impeded most strongly. This indicates that the rafted structure is

   at 1050, 1100 and 1150 degrees C. A transient thermal structural finite
   element solution was employed to analyze the stress distribution in the
   coatings. The reasons why the two kinds of the coatings have different
   lifetimes have been explored. The results indicate that the stresses
   (S(x)) within the nanostructured yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ)
   ceramic layer in the axial (x) direction is about 67% that of the
   traditional YSZ. The stress (S(y)) in the radial (y) direction at the
   vicinity of the interface between the thermally grown oxide scale (TGO)
   and the YSZ topcoat at the edge of the sample is only about 73% that of
   the traditional YSZ. So it could be concluded that the decrease of the
   stress in the nanostructured ceramic layers is a fundamental reason,
   resulting in longer thermal cycling lifetime of the nanostructured

   changes in the microstructure, such as gamma '-phase coarsening and
   coalescence, excessive grain-boundary secondary M(23)C(6) carbides
   formation, and primary MC carbides decomposition, were noticeably more
   advanced in the rejuvenated blade. The stress-rupture life of the
   rejuvenated blade decreased significantly compared to that of the new
   blade after the same number of hours in service. The cause of this
   decrease appears to be related to a release of additional amounts of
   carbon and carbide-forming elements into the matrix during rejuvenating
   heat treatment as a result of the primary MC carbide decomposition.

AB Improving the performance of the extrusion tools and predicting their
   life postulates knowledge of their failure mechanisms. In this work,
   actual failure cases of brass extrusion dies made from stellite 413 are
   presented and their mechanisms are studied. It is found that exposed
   parts of the die suffer from cyclic loading which, in combination with
   manufacturing defects and design imperfections, promote the initiation
   of fatigue cracks. Aging during service of stellite 413 inserts reduces
   die life due to the formation of a network of brittle carbides
   surrounding the ductile cobalt dendrites. During extrusion, the M(7)C(3)
   carbide dissolves in the cobalt matrix leading to precipitation of new
   M(23)C(6) and eta-carbide types. This occurs at relatively low working
   temperatures, in the range of 600-650 degrees C, instead of 850-1100
   degrees C as referred in the resent literature, and is probably assisted
   by high stresses prevailing during the extrusion process. (c) 2006

   formation of secondary reaction zone (SRZ). In this study, high velocity
   frame sprayed (HVOF) EQ coatings designed for 2(nd) generation Ni-base
   superalloy were deposited on 4th and 5(th) generation Ni-base
   superalloys. The stability of microstructure at the interface and creep
   property of the coating system were investigated. Less than 50 mu
   m-thick of the interdiffusion zone and no SRZ were observed in EQ
   coating system after 300 h heat treatment at 1100 degrees C, in contrast
   to beyond 90 mu m-thick of diffusion zone and 140 mu m-thick of SRZ in
   the conventional CoNiCrAlY coating system. Creep strength of
   Al-diffusion and CoNiCrAlY coated 4(th) generation superalloys showed
   decrease in thin creep specimens, but EQ coated 4th generation
   superalloy showed equivalent creep strength for bare material.

AB Hardfacing is one of the most useful and economical ways to improve the
   performance of components subjected to severe wear conditions. The aim
   of the present work was to investigate the influence of hardfacing on
   the hardness and wear resistance of a hot working tool steel. Two cobalt
   based and one nickel based superalloys were used as hardfacing
   materials. Stellite 6 and 21 were deposited on H11 steel via tungsten
   inert gas (TIG) and shielded metal arc welding and Inconel 625 was
   deposited by TIG welding techniques. The pin on disc high temperature
   wear tests were carried out on hardfaced materials. The worn surfaces
   were also characterised using SEM and X-ray diffraction methods. The
   results showed that TIG hardfacings process having a low dilution, owing
   to the refined solidification structure and high capacity of work
   hardening enhances better wear resistance.

AB The post-weld heat treatment (PWHT) cracking in autogenous gas tungsten
   arc (GTA) welded Inconel 738LC superalloy, which was given two different
   preweld heat treatments, was studied. One of the preweld heat
   treatments, designated as SHT, consisted of solution heat treatment at
   1120 degrees C for 2 h in vacuum followed by argon quenching. The second
   preweld heat treatment, designated as UMT, consisted of solution
   treatment at 1120 degrees C for 2 h followed by air cooling and then
   aging at 1025 degrees C for 16 h followed by water quenching. The welded
   specimens were given the same conventional PWHT, which consisted of SHT
   at 1120 degrees C for 2 h in vacuum followed by argon quenching and
   subsequent aging at 845 degrees C for 24 h in vacuum. Microstructural
   examination of the welded SHT and UMT treated material showed that
   intergranular microfissuring occurred during welding only in the heat
   affected zone (HAZ) with some cracks extending into the adjoining base
   metal ( BM), whereas after the PWHT microfissures were observed in the
   fusion zone (FZ), HAZ and the BM far removed from the HAZ. The crack
   width ranged from 5 to 10 mu m in the PWHT specimens as compared with 1
   - 2 mu m in the as welded sections. Although similar type of cracks was
   observed in samples given the two preweld heat treatments, the UMT
   preweld heat treatment was found to result in a significant reduction in
   average total crack length and average crack length, both during welding
   and during the subsequent PWHT. After PWHT, SHT samples had similar to
   43% more cracking than the UMT samples. It is suggested that a larger
   particle size of gamma' precipitates in the HAZ and a smaller size of
   HAZ in the as welded samples, combined with a softer BM of the UMT
   material ( hardness 280 +/- 12 HV10, as compared with 380 +/- 10 HV10 of
   the SHT material) resulted in an improved capability of the material to
   absorb the strain - aging stresses, and hence a reduced incidence of
   cracking during PWHT.

   using hot compression experiments in the temperatures between 1000 and

   addition, hot workability of this alloy has been analyzed by employing
   flow-localization parameter. The results show that both kinds of
   softening mechanism, dynamic recovery and dynamic recrystallization,
   occur during hot working, where at 1000 degrees C the main mechanism is
   dynamic recovery and at higher temperatures and strain rate of
   0.001-0.01 s(-1) dynamic recrystallization takes place. Calculations
   demonstrates that this alloy mainly have a good workability for the

   degrees C critical conditions may be raised and flow localized region
   could be formed. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The thermo-mechanical stability of the oxide layer that grows between
   the metallic bond coat and the ceramic top coat on superalloy turbine
   blades determines the lifetime of the system. Understanding the
   mechanisms of oxidation of the bond coat that is applied to the
   superalloy is key to improving the performance of the thermal barrier
   coatings. FIB-SIMS (Focused Ion Beam-Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry)
   techniques in conjunction with tracer diffusion experiments represent a
   powerful tool in characterizing this oxide layer. This paper presents
   the results of oxidation studies on single crystal nickel-base
   superalloys/bond coat systems. In these studies, a two-stage oxidation
   experiment is used where (18)O(2) serves as a tracer element during the
   second stage oxidation. The aluminium oxide grown in (16)O(2) during the
   first stage oxidation represents an initial layer of oxide. Mass spectra
   collected by FIB-SIMS reveal the counter mass transportation of inward
   oxygen diffusion and outward diffusion of aluminium. New oxide formation
   during the second stage oxidation under an (18)O(2) enriched environment
   is observed at both the gas/oxide interface as well as the
   oxide/superalloy interface. FIB-SIMS scanning enables high-resolution
   isotope maps, in particular (18)O(-), to be captured. These confirm the
   existence of new oxide forming at the oxide/superalloy interface with
   clear indications of short circuit diffusion paths through the existing
   oxide. These data allow the diffusion mechanisms for different
   superalloy/bond coat systems to be identified and contrasted, allowing
   the role of alloying additions to be elucidated. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB A nickel-based superalloy (GTD-111 equivalent) with a directionally
   solidified gain structure designed for land-based gas turbines has been
   investigated using a hot isostatic press (HIP) with respect to the
   rejuvenation of degraded microstructure after a long-term operation. The
   invest-cast and heat-treated superalloy was intentionally degraded in an
   electrical furnace for simulation of the service operation, and treated
   in a HIP at 1190 degrees C and 120 MPa for 4 h. Four different HIP
   processes differentiated from each other whether the pressure was
   applied on heating and/or on cooling were tested. This work focused on
   the evolution of the microstructure and chemical composition in the
   dendrite core after the HIP treatment. From the experimental
   observations, the effect of the pressure on these micro-structural and
   compositional evolutions was considered in two ways: the retarded
   diffusion of the alloying elements under high pressure and the volume
   difference between gamma' precipitates and the gamma matrix. (c) 2006

AB The microstructure of a CoNiCrAlY coating vacuum plasma sprayed onto an
   aluminized MARM002 Ni-base superalloy was investigated in the
   as-deposited condition, after heat treatment to promote adhesion, and
   after oxidation in air for 100 h at 1100 degrees C. The as-sprayed
   coating comprised three main phases: the solid solution gamma-(Ni, Co),
   the intermetallic compound p-(Ni, Co)Al and the intermetallic compound
   gamma'-(Ni, CO)(3)Al that grew as small precipitates inside gamma
   grains. gamma' phase was present even in the as-sprayed condition
   because of Al diffusion into the coating from the aluminized substrate
   during manufacture at temperatures of 800-1000 degrees C. The
   microstructure was fine-scale and complex with beta phase within gamma
   grains, at gamma grain boundaries and large beta grains surrounded by
   gamma matrix. After heat treatment, the microstructure comprised p
   grains typically of 3-mu m diameter randomly distributed throughout the
   gamma matrix. There was little or no Al depletion of the coating because
   of Al diffusion from the substrate aluminized layer. Diffusion of C from
   the substrate induced the formation of Cr(23)C(6) and M(5)Y (where M was
   predominantly Ni and Co) in the assprayed coating; with M5Y transforming
   to Y(2)O(3) during heat treatment due to internal oxidation. After
   oxidation, there was a loss of Al despite the aluminized layer, because
   of the formation of a thermally grown oxide (TGO) layer on the upper
   surface of the coating, mainly comprising Al(2)O(3) with some Cr(2)O(3).
   There was a corresponding reduction in p phase fraction and a
   substantial reduction in the substrate aluminized layer thickness. Some
   grains persisted close to the TGO at grain boundaries, together with
   Y(2)O(3) and Cr(23)C(6) particles. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   Waspalloy) were examined to quantify the rate of Al interdiffusion as a
   function of initial superalloy composition. The diffusion couples were
   assembled with Invar steel jig encapsulated in Ar by sealing in quartz
   capsules and annealed at 1050 degrees C for 96 h. Concentration profiles
   measured by electron probe microanalysis in the single-phase beta-NiAl
   region were used to determine interdiffusion fluxes and effective
   interdiffusion coefficients of individual components in the single-phase
   beta-NiAl side of the couple. The values determined using experimental
   concentration profiles of the single-phase beta-NiAl side of the couple
   were used to predict effective interdiffusion coefficients in multiphase
   superalloy side of the couple based on mass balance and local continuity
   of interdiffusion fluxes. Microstructural and compositional stability of

AB The manufacture of a Ni-based superalloy (GH163) was conducted by plasma
   transferred arc-assisted deposition starting from master alloy powders.
   The microstructure of the manufactured samples was characterized by
   using optical microscopy (OM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning
   electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). It
   was found that the as-deposited samples exhibited a fine and homogenous
   cellular dendrite structure with a stronger crystallographic orientation
   along < 001 > direction. Electron probe X-ray microanalyzer (EMPA)
   revealed that the composition distribution in the whole sample was
   pretty uniform and no significant segregation occurred in the interface
   regions between deposited layers. After solid solution and ageing
   treatments, a large number of fine gamma' particles with a size of about
   20-30 nm precipitated inside grains of the alloy. Electron diffraction
   using TEM indicates that the gamma' phase precipitated has a FCC
   structure and exhibited a completely coherent relation with the matrix.
   In addition, a few fine carbide particles were formed at grain
   boundaries, which are believed to be good for creep strength of the
   superalloy. The present results demonstrate that the plasma transferred
   arc-assisted deposition is a promising technology for the manufacture of
   Ni-based superalloy with fine and homogenous microstructure. (c) 2006

AB The previously developed cyclic thermogravimetry analysis (CTGA)
   [Monceau D, Poquillon D. Oxid Met 2004;61:143-163] method is applied to
   the cyclic oxidation at 1150 degrees C of a NiCoCrAlYTa-coated and an
   uncoated single-crystal nickel-based superalloy MC2. A new procedure to
   correct the buoyancy effect is proposed in order to evaluate the amount
   of oxide formed during the heating periods, which can be important for
   alloys forming fast-growing transient oxides or during cycling with slow
   heating rates. It is shown that cyclic thermogravimetry is an useful
   technique for quantifying the oxidation resistance of an industrial
   alloy. Moreover, the behaviour of the alloy is better described with
   CTGA than with a classic cyclic gravimetric test, because both
   isothermal oxidation kinetics and spalling behaviour are assessed
   independently. In the present case, it is shown clearly that the
   NiCoCrAlYTa coating greatly improves the cyclic oxidation resistance
   without decreasing the isothermal oxidation kinetics. Finally, the use
   of CTGA for performance and time-of-life evaluations is demonstrated.

   frequency of 0.1 Hz. The results show a deleterious effect of the

AB The microstructure of the transient liquid phase (TLP) bonded joint of a
   cast INCONEL 738LC superalloy, made with a commercial Ni-Cr-B filler
   alloy, Nicrobraz 150, was examined by analytical scanning and
   transmission electron microscopic techniques. Due to incomplete
   isothermal solidification at the bonding temperature, the residual
   liquid interlayer transformed to nonequilibrium eutectic
   microconstituents consisting of chromium-rich M5B3, nickel-rich M23B6,
   and nickel-based gamma solid solution phases. Also, a significant volume
   fraction of complex fee Cr-Mo-W rich carboborides was observed in the
   joint/base alloy interface region. This is contrary to the predictions
   of the currently available TLP models that predict a precipitate-free
   joint/base alloy interface. It is suggested that solid-state diffusion
   of boron prior to completion of equilibration process induced the
   formation of carbo-boride phase, which needs to be adequately considered
   to develop an optimum postbraze heat-treatment process to produce a
   joint with optimum properties.

AB The changes in microstructure induced by forging and their influence on
   flow strength of hot isostatically pressed P/M Rene 95 as revealed by
   constant strain rate compression tests under simulated isothermal
   forging conditions are discussed. Results are presented for initially
   fine (7 mu m) and coarse (50 mu m) grained compacts tested at
   temperatures of 1050, 1075 and 1100 degrees C and at strain rates in the
   range from 10(-4) to 1 s(-1). Under these test conditions, both the fine
   and coarse-grained compacts recrystallize and their grain size is
   refined during plastic deformation. This grain refinement gives rise to
   softening in both materials. Ultimately, their microstructures transform
   into the same equiaxed fine-grained microduplex structure at which point
   their flow strength becomes identical. Continued deformation at that
   point produces no further change in grain size or flow strength. In this
   regime of deformation, the microduplex grain size and flow strength are
   independent of the original microstructure but are conditioned by the
   strain rate at a given temperature. The steady state grain size
   increases whereas the steady flow strength decreases with a decrease in
   strain rate and/or an increase in temperature. It is shown how changes
   in microstructure and flow strength during isothermal forging can be
   modelled in P/M Rene 95 compacts by means of established deformation
   models for predicting peak flow strength, using the steady state
   deformation data as a boundary condition for the evolution of
   microstructure and flow strength and a model for deformation-induced
   recrystallization during forging that has been recently developed for
   this class of materials. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   Adhesion properties of annealed Pt films on gamma-Al(2)O(3) and

   improvement of the pull-off force (approximate to 0 to approximate to

AB An Al and Cr gradient NiCoCrAlYSiB coating was prepared by a two-step
   deposition: (i) deposition of a NiCoCrAlYSiB layer onto Ni-based
   superalloy surface by arc ion plating (AIP); and (ii) co-deposition of
   NiCoCrAlYSiB and Cr-Al by AIP and magnetron sputtering (MS),
   respectively. The results of EPMA show that Al and Cr have a gradient
   distribution in the surface layer of the gradient coatings. After
   annealing, the NiCoCrAlYSiB coatings consist of gamma/gamma' and
   beta-NiAl, while the gradient coatings consist of sigma-(Cr, Co), AlCr2,
   and Al8Cr5, besides gamma/gamma' and beta-NiAl. The phases of sigma-(Cr,
   Co), AlCr2, and Al8Cr5 can act as reservoir phases of Cr and Al to
   improve the hot corrosion resistance and lifetime of the coatings. In
   order to investigate the effect of Al and Cr on the hot corrosion of
   coatings, NiCoCrAlYSiB coatings and the gradient coatings were coated
   with 0.5 mg (Na2SO4+K2SO4 20 wt.% salt mixture)/cm(2) and oxidized at
   900 degrees C for 20 h. XRD and EDS results show that there are only the
   alumina formed on the NiCoCrAlYSiB coatings, so the basic fluxing of
   Al2O3 occurred, which caused an accelerated hot corrosion after 10 h.
   For the gradient coatings, there formed Al2O3 and Cr2O3 at the primary
   stage of hot corrosion. Cr2O3 is easier to react with Na2SO4 than Al2O3,
   which reduces the oxygen ion activity of Na2SO4, so Al2O3 was protected.
   The formation of the continual and protective layer of Al2O3 and Cr2O3
   leads to the hot corrosion kinetics of gradient coatings similar to
   oxidation kinetics. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Inert gas atomized (IGA) superalloy Inconel 718 powder was consolidated
   by hot isostatic pressing (HIPing) at 1200 degrees C under 120 MPa
   pressure for 3 h. The HIPed alloy heat treated as per the aerospace
   materials specification (AMS) 5662J standard schedule, viz. solution
   treatment (ST) at 980 degrees C for 1 h/water quenching (WQ) to room
   temperature (RT) and a two-step ageing treatment (AT) at 720 degrees C
   for 8 h/furnace cooling (FC) at 55 degrees C h(-1) to 620 degrees C and
   holding at 620 degrees C for 8 h and air cooling (AC) to room
   temperature has exhibited the yield strength (YS) and ultimate tensile
   strength (UTS) comparable to that of the conventionally processed
   (forged and heat treated) IN 718. However, its ductility and stress
   rupture properties at 650 degrees C were found to be poor due to the
   presence of prior particle boundary (PPB) networks decorated with highly
   stable oxides (Al2O3 and TiO2) and brittle MC (Nb, Ti)C carbides. To
   mitigate this problem, the HIPed alloy was subjected to solution
   treatment at 1270 degrees C for 1 h followed by re-HIPing at 1100
   degrees C/130 MPa/3 h before heat-treating it as per AMS 5662J standard
   schedule. Optical and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of the alloy
   processed under modified HIPing and heat treatment conditions have shown
   the dissolution of MC-carbides, breaking up of PPB networks and
   formation of equiaxed grains with an average diameter of about 50 mu m.
   Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of this alloy has revealed
   uniform distribution of gamma" and gamma' strengthening precipitates in
   the gamma-matrix and the presence of delta(Ni3Nb) phase as well as very
   fine oxide particles near the grain boundaries. The tensile properties
   of the alloy processed under modified conditions have shown quite
   satisfactory levels of YS and UTS combined with a significantly improved
   elongation (EL) values at room temperature (19.5%) and at 650 degrees C
   (8.0%). The improvement in alloy ductility was found to correlate well
   with the fractography of the tensile tested specimens, which showed the
   predominance of transgranular fracture with fine dimples at room
   temperature and fine dimples together with the particle boundary facets
   at 650 degrees C. The stress rupture properties of modified processed
   alloy at 650 degrees C and at a stress level of 690MPa have shown a
   vastly improved rupture life of 80 h combined with 5% ductility. The
   improvement in tensile and stress rupture properties accomplished by the
   modified processing makes it possible to explore the near net shape
   capability of HIP technology to its full potential in the development of
   alloy 718 components. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB High-cycle fatigue (HCF), involving the premature initiation and/or
   rapid propagation of cracks to failure due to high-frequency cyclic
   loading, remains a principal cause of failures in gas-turbine propulsion
   systems. In this work, we explore the feasibility of using
   "grain-boundary engineering" as a means to enhance the microstructural
   resistance to HCF. Specifically, sequential thermomechanical processing,
   involving alternate cycles of strain and annealing, was used to increase
   the fraction of "special" grain boundaries and to break up the
   interconnected network of "random" boundaries, in a commercial
   polycrystalline Ni-based superalloy (ME3). The effect of such
   grain-boundary engineering on the fatigue-crack-propagation behavior of
   large (similar to 8 to 20 mm), through-thickness cracks at 25 degrees C,
   700 degrees C, and 800 degrees C was examined. Although there was little
   influence of an increased special boundary fraction at ambient
   temperatures, the resistance to near-threshold crack growth was
   definitively improved at elevated temperatures, with fatigue threshold
   stress intensities some 10 to 20 pct higher than at 25 degrees C ,
   concomitant with a lower proportion (similar to 20 pct) of intergranular
   cracking.

AB In service, gas turbine components with thermal barrier coatings
   experience high cyclic mechanical and thermal loading. Important, but
   not yet considered sufficiently, are the multi-axial stresses arising
   from thermal gradients.
   In this study, multi-axial stresses were simulated in laboratory
   experiments using a specially designed test rig. Cyclic thermomechanical
   fatigue experiments with radial thermal gradients (TGMF) were performed
   on tubular specimens consisting of a directionally densified super-alloy
   substrate, a NiCoCrAlY bond coat, and a ceramic thermal barrier coating
   (TBC). The test setup enables surface temperatures of 1000 degrees C,
   temperature differences over the whole wall thickness of the specimen of
   about 170 degrees C, and high heating and cooling rates.
   The resultant defects have specific features consisting of cracks
   parallel to the bond coat/TBC interface. They are located within the
   bond coat close to this interface. Weakening thus this interface, the
   defects enhance TBC spallation.
   Finite element analyses, calculating stress distributions during the
   quasi-stationary condition of the TGMF test cycle at high temperature
   and the transient stress distributions during cooling, were used to
   discuss the evolution of these specific defects. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V

AB During the brazing process of the rocket engine's nozzle skirt assembly
   made from Fe-Ni based super alloy pipes with Pd based brazing filler,
   the erosion corrosion pits were sometimes engraved on those pipes'
   surface. The corrosion is considered to be assisted by the dynamic flow
   of the molten brazing filler. In order to estimate the amount of erosion
   corrosion and to prevent it, the solubility and the dissolution rate of
   Ni to the molten Ag-Cu-Pd brazing filler are measured experimentally.
   The Ni crucible poured with the Ag-Cu-Pd brazing filler was heated up to
   1320 K and quenched after the various keeping time. The microstructure
   of the solidified brazing filler part's cross sections was observed, and
   the amount of the dissolved Ni was estimated using the image processing
   technique. The solubility was about 5.53 mass% and the initial
   dissolution rate was 6.28 x 10(-3) mass%/s. Using these data, more
   elaborate dynamic flow simulation will be able to conduct.

AB Active element modified aluminide diffusion coatings on IN738 substrates
   were produced by a new route using continuously cast, aluminum alloy
   wires consisting of Al-Y, Al-Ce, Al-La and Al-Si-Y. The cast wires were
   used as evaporation sources for ion-vapour deposition followed by
   diffusion heat treatments to form nickel aluminide coatings. In order to
   examine the oxidation resistance of these coatings at elevated
   temperatures, thermal cyclic oxidation experiments were carried out in
   air at 1050 degrees C. While all coatings were found to provide
   significant protection, the Al-La modified coatings provided the
   greatest resistance to cyclic oxidation. On the other hand, with
   coatings based on Al-Si-Y alloys, while silicon has a strong ability to
   reduce the outward diffusion of aluminum, the adverse effect of silicon
   on mechanical properties of the coating, together with the formation of
   volatile silicon monoxide, led to catastrophic localized oxidation of
   the protective coatings.

AB The effect of concentration of aluminium in filler alloys on heat
   affected zone (HAZ) microfissuring in TIG welded cast Inconel 738LC (IN
   738LC) superalloy was studied. Three fillers, IN 625, IN 617 and Haynes
   214, with aluminium concentrations varying from 0.2 to 4.5 wt-%,
   respectively, were used to TIG weld cast IN 738LC alloy plates subjected
   to two different preweld heat treatments. One preweld heat treatment was
   the standard solution heat treatment at 1120 degrees C for 2 h followed
   by argon quenching. The second was a novel overaging treatment developed
   by the present authors, termed UM treatment, involving solution
   treatment at 1120 degrees C followed by air cooling and subsequent
   ageing at 1025 degrees C followed by water quenching. Detailed
   microstructural analysis of the welds and base metal was done by optical
   and analytical electron microscopy. Intergranular microfissures were
   observed in the HAZ of all the welds, irrespective of the filler alloy
   and the preweld heat treatment, while no cracks were observed in the
   fusion zone in any of the samples. The cracks were mostly found to be
   associated with constitutionally liquated MC carbides, borides,
   sulphocarbides, gamma-gamma' eutectic and gamma' precipitates. The
   cracking was found to increase with increase in the fusion zone hardness
   and the aluminium content of the fillers, i.e. it was minimum for IN 625
   and maximum for Haynes 214, for a particular preweld heat treatment.
   Between the two heat treatments, the UM treated samples with a smaller
   base metal hardness, however, exhibited a considerably reduced HAZ
   cracking. That is, the hardness of the fusion zone as well as the base
   metal appears to have a significant effect on the cracking
   susceptibility of the welds made with different fillers.

AB Process models of the various stages of gas-turbine disc manufacture
   have been integrated to simulate the physical and microstructural
   transformations occurring within a nickel-based superalloy throughout
   the entire manufacturing route. Production of these critical rotating
   structural components requires several distinct processing stages:
   vacuum-induction melting (VIM), vacuum-arc remelting (VAR),
   homogenization heat treatment, cogging, forging, final heat treatment,
   and machining. During the course of these consecutive manufacturing
   stages, the various thermal and thermomechanical processes lead to
   significant changes in both the microstructural characteristics and
   internal stresses in the alloy. Although separate models have previously
   been developed to simulate the individual processing stages, this
   article describes how these models, which are explicitly expressed in
   terms of the initial and evolving microstructure, can be integrated to
   simulate the entire manufacturing process from secondary melting through
   to the final forging and heat treatment. The grain structure predicted
   for one stage is explicitly transferred as the initial conditions for
   the model, which simulates the grain evolution during the next step.
   This information also provides the basis of microstructure-explicit
   constitutive equations describing the material behavior.
   Industrial-scale manufacturing trials associated with the production of
   an INCONEL alloy 718 aeroengine turbine disc were used to validate the
   integrated model for grain size. The model also allows intrinsic or
   extrinsic defects entrained within the material during the initial
   solidification stage to be tracked through the subsequent processes.
   This provides a basis for calculating the areas of discs likely to be
   vulnerable to such defects and whether they might be removed during
   machining. It was shown that the microstructure of the alloy changes
   significantly throughout the process chain, the final microstructure and
   defect distribution at each stage being related to those formed in the
   previous stages. There was good agreement between the model predictions
   and experimental observations for both the intermediate and final
   processing stages. The implications of such integrated modeling for
   quality assurance through process control are discussed.

AB Hot corrosion is a serious problem in power generation equipment, gas
   turbines, internal combustion engines, fluidized bed combustion,
   industrial waste incinerators and paper and pulp industries. No alloy is
   immune to hot corrosion attack indefinitely although there are some
   alloy compositions that require a long initiation time at which the hot
   corrosion process moves from the initiation stage to the propagation
   stage. Superalloys have been developed for high-temperature
   applications. However, these alloys are not always able to meet both the
   high-temperature strength and high-temperature corrosion resistance
   simultaneously, so the need to be protected from corrosion. The
   high-temperature protecting system must meet several criteria, provide
   adequate environment resistance, be chemically and mechanically
   compatible with the substrate, be practically applicable, reliable and
   economically viable. This paper briefly reviews the hot corrosion of
   some Ni- and Fe-base superalloys to understand the phenomenon.
   Comprehensive reviews of the corrosion of coatings have appeared
   regularly since early 1970; the purpose of this paper is not to repeat
   the published materials but rather to focus on research trends and to
   point out some research prospects.
   High-velocity oxy-fuel (HVOF) spraying is a new and rapidly developing
   technology in combating high-temperature corrosion and is now
   challenging the vacuum plasma spraying technique (VPS), which is very
   expensive (capital costs approximately 2 million US$). HVOF coatings
   have very low porosity, high hardness, high abrasive resistance, good
   wear resistance with a strong ability to resist high-temperature
   corrosion resistance. The purpose here is to summarize the performance
   of such coatings on various substrates. The effect of coatings
   thickness, residual stresses induced in the substrates, pre and postheat
   treatment of the HVOF coatings have been reviewed with the aims of
   summarizing their high-temperature corrosion resistance properties. (c)

AB The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of electrical
   discharge machining (EDM) process conditions on the crack susceptibility
   of a nickel-based superalloy. Because sequential processes are
   inevitable in the manufacturing industry, the effects of EDM and
   post-EDM processes on the crack propagation behaviour of the components
   need to be clearly understood. The altered material zone (AMZ) of EDM
   processed Hastelloy X revealed different morphology before and after
   solution heat treatment. Depending on the EDM dielectric fluid and the
   post-EDM process such as solution heat treatment, it was found that
   cracks existing in the recast layer could propagate into substrate when
   a 20% strain tensile force was applied at room temperature. In the case
   of the kerosene electrical discharge (ED) machined specimens, it was
   observed that carburisation and sharp crack propagation along the grain
   boundary occurred after the heat treatment. However, the deionised water
   ED machined specimens after heat treatment underwent oxidation and
   showed no crack propagation behaviour. A metallurgical evaluation of the
   microstructure of the AMZ was also conducted.

AB The mechanical strength of the oxide dispersion-strengthened (ODS)
   nickelbase superalloy PM 3030 during deformation at constant strain rate
   (CSR) is discussed with special emphasis placed on its dependence on
   grain structure. In the fine-grain state the material shows a very high
   strength at low temperatures due to Hall-Petch type strengthening.
   However, the 0.2 % offset yield strength sigma(0.2) falls off sharply at
   temperatures above 700 degrees C. Increase of grain size by isothermal
   annealing leads to a reduction of sigma(0.2) at low temperatures, but
   also to an increase of creep resistance at higher temperatures. Coarse
   and elongated grain structures essentially eliminate grain-boundary
   sliding and reduce diffusion-controlled void formation and, therefore,
   exhibit a superior strength level at elevated temperatures. The
   dependence Of sigma(0.2) on grain structure results in a cross-over of
   the sigma(0.2) vs. T-curves within a narrow temperature range where all
   grain variants exhibit similar mechanical strengths. In accord with
   Dieter [1] this region may be called "equicohesion range" of a given
   material with identical chemical composition and particle structure.

AB The nickel-based alloy Nimonic 80A possesses strength, and corrosion,
   creep and oxidation resistance at high temperature. These products are
   used for aerospace, marine engineering and power generation, etc. The
   control of forging parameters such as strain, strain rate, temperature
   and holding time is important because the microstructure change in hot
   working affects the mechanical properties. It is necessary to understand
   the microstructure variation evolution. The microstructure evolution
   occurs by recovery, recrystallization and grain growth phenomena. The
   dynamic recrystallization evolution has been studied in the temperature
   range of 950-1250 degrees C and strain rate of 0.05-5 s(-1) using hot
   compression tests. The grain growth has been studied in the temperature
   range of 950-1250 degrees C, strain rate of 0.05, 5 s(-1), and holding
   times of 5, 10, 100, 600 s using hot compression tests. Modeling
   equations are developed to represent the flow curve, recrystallized
   grain size, recrystallized volume fraction and grain growth phenomena by
   various tests. Parameters of modeling equation are expressed as a
   function of the Zener-Hollomon parameter. The modeling equation for
   grain growth is expressed as a function of initial grain size and
   holding time. The developed modeling equation was combined with
   thermo-viscoplastic finite element modeling to predict various
   microstructure change evolutions during thermo mechanical processing.
   The predicted grain size in developed FE simulation is compared with
   results obtained in various tests. In order to obtain a fine and
   homogeneous microstructure and good mechanical properties in forging the
   FEM would become a useful tool in the simulation of the microstructure
   development. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB To investigate the effect of carbon on grain boundary serration, three
   kinds of the 316 stainless steels with different carbon content are used
   for this experiment. It was observed that the higher the carbon
   contents, the more the fraction of grain boundary serration. Therefore,
   it may be concluded that grain boundary serration is affected by the
   carbon contents. In addition, grain boundary is serrated prior to the
   formation of the carbides. To obtain the direct evidence of the effect
   of carbon on the occurrence of grain boundary serration, the sample with
   the lowest carbon content is carburized to increase carbon content. It
   is observed that grain boundary is considerably serrated after
   carburizing. These facts indicate that grain boundary serration is
   strongly influenced by carbon contents. It is suggested that carbon is
   major alloying element to accelerate the occurrence of grain boundary

AB The hot deformation behavior of nickel-base superalloy UDIMET 720 in
   solution-treated conditions, simulating the forging process of the
   alloy, was studied using hot compression experiments. Specimens were
   deformed in the temperature range of 1000 degrees C to 1175 degrees C
   with strain rates of 10(-3) to 1 s(-1) and total strain of 0.8. Below
   1100 degrees C, all specimens showed flow localization as shear band
   through the diagonal direction, with more severity at higher strain
   rates. A uniform deformation was observed when testing between 1100
   degrees C and 1150 degrees C with dynamic recrystallization as the major
   flow softening mechanism above 1125 degrees C. Deformation above gamma'
   solvus temperature was accompanied with grain boundary separation. The
   hot working window was determined to be in the interval 1100 degrees C
   to 1150 degrees C. Thermomechanical behavior of the material was modeled
   using the power-law, the Sellars-Tegart, and an empirical equation. The
   flow stress values showed a nonlinear dependence of strain rate
   sensitivity to strain rate. The analysis indicated that the empirical
   method provides a better constitutive equation for process modeling of
   this alloy. The apparent activation energy for deformation was
   calculated and its variations with strain rate and temperature are
   discussed.

AB The thermophysical properties of B2 structure based Al-Ni-Ru-M alloys
   have been studied for different alloy compositions. A normal value for
   the thermal conductivity of these alloys is within the range of 10-20 W
   m(-1) K-1 range at room temperature, but can be reduced to approximately
   3.5 W m(-1) K-1 by modifying the alloy composition. The observed
   positive and approximately linear temperature dependence of the thermal
   conductivity of B2 structure based on Al-Ni-Ru-M alloys indicates their
   metal electronic nature.
   Thermal expansion coefficients (i) increase with temperature, (ii) are
   similar to those of superalloys and steels, and (iii) are mostly
   dependent on Ru content. A fused and subsequently pulverized Al-Ni-Ru B2
   alloy was deposited on a Ni-based superalloy substrate made of modified
   CMSX-4 using vacuum and atmospheric plasma spraying. The coatings
   obtained were characterized for their microstructure, phase composition,
   hardness, and bond strength. The coatings exhibited sound
   microstructural integrity and favorable coating-substrate adhesion. The
   phases originally present in the powder were also found to be retained
   in the coating. Interdifftision processes between the investigated
   coatings and the Ni-based superalloy substrate were primarily estimated
   by the diffusion couples approach. The segregation of a new
   intermetallic phase was detected at the (Al50Ni40Ru10 alloy)/(modified
   CMSX-4) interface. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Grain size and microstructural features of cast superalloy K4169 were
   investigated under various melting and casting conditions with and
   without the addition of grain refiners. It is found that lowering
   pouring temperature and adding refiners to the melt can lead to grain
   refinement of gamma matrix and improve the proportion of equiaxed
   grains. At a conventional pouring temperature of 1400 degrees C, the
   average size of equiaxed grains could be refined to the order of ASTM
   3.2, the proportion of equiaxed grains at transverse cross-section could
   be improved from 56 to 99%. The results also indicate that the average
   length of primary dendrite axis is shortened with the addition of
   refiners, but the secondary dendrite arm spacing keeps almost unchanged
   because local solidification time remained constant. In addition, the
   microsegregation of main elements such as Fe, Cr, Nb, Mo and Ti is
   alleviated with the decrease in grain size, and the grain morphology
   have transformed from dendrite in coarse- to granulate in fine-grained
   castings. At higher melt pouring temperature, the amount of
   microporosity in samples with the addition of refiners can be greatly
   reduced. The mechanisms of grain refinement and increase in equiaxed
   grain proportion were proposed. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB The effect of delta phase on the hydrogen embrittlement (HE) sensitivity
   of Inconel 718 was investigated by conducting notch tensile tests. Notch
   tensile specimens with various precipitation morphologies of delta phase
   were prepared with different heat treatments, and hydrogen was charged
   into the tensile specimens before tensile tests via a cathodic charging
   process. The loss of notch tensile strength (NTS) due to the charged
   hydrogen was used to evaluate the hydrogen embrittlement sensitivity.
   The results show that delta phase has deleterious effect on NTSs, and
   the fracture of hydrogen-charged specimens initiated near the notch
   surfaces. The loss of NTS caused by precharged hydrogen can be greatly
   decreased by dissolving delta phase. delta-free Inconel 718 alloy is
   proposed for the applications in hydrogen environments.

AB This paper reports an experimental investigation on the effect of
   multiple twinning on the interface population in two low stacking-fault
   alloys. This is an important topic for grain boundary engineering
   because annealing twinning is the indirect cause of improved
   intergranular corrosion resistance in this class of materials.
   Proportions of Sigma3(n) (n = 1-5) boundaries were analysed in both a
   brass specimen and a superalloy specimen where the boundaries had been
   processed so as to be very mobile and less mobile respectively. When
   Sigma3 twin boundaries (as distinct from Sigma3 grain boundaries) are
   discounted, the Sigma3(n) distribution for both specimens had a peak at
   Sigma9, because Sigma3 + Sigma9 --> Sigma3 occurs more frequently than
   Sigma3 + Sigma9 --> Sigma27. The distributions and reactions between
   various Sigma3(n) values are described and discussed in detail. A novel
   trace analysis procedure is used to extract information from Sigma3
   boundaries to decide whether or not they are annealing twins, and so
   provide a convenient means to assess proportions of twin and non-twin
   Sigma3s. The data show unambiguously that a significant proportion of
   Sigma3s are not on {111}, and these boundaries have on average higher
   angular deviations from the exact Sigma3 reference misorientation than
   do other Sigma3s. A population of Sigma3s which were vicinal to
   annealing twins were also recorded. These data support the contention
   that profuse annealing twinning produces concurrently many not-twin
   Sigma3s, which are pivotal in grain boundary engineering. (C) 2005

AB Electron-beam welding (EBW) is commonly employed in the aeroengine
   industry for the welding of high integrity components, fabricated from
   high-strength superalloys. For such applications, it is important to
   predict distortions and residual stresses induced by the process. Melt
   run trials have been carried out on nickel-base superalloy Inconel 706
   plates using the EBW technique in order to analyse the effects of
   welding parameters on geometrical characteristics and microstructure of
   the bead. Butt-welded plates have been then investigated by means of
   tensile tests, microstructural analysis, and X-ray diffraction
   measurements. A finite element model of the process has been set up
   using an uncoupled thermal-mechanical analysis. The heat source was
   modelled using a superimposition of a spherical and a conical shape heat
   source with Gaussian power density distribution in order to reproduce
   the nail shape of the fusion zone (FZ). The parameters of the source
   were chosen so that the model would match with experimentally determined
   weld pool shape and temperatures, measured with thermocouples.
   Subsequently, the thermal analysis was used to drive the non-linear
   mechanical analysis. The predicted residual stresses were then compared
   with X-ray diffraction measurements. It was found that the correct
   thermal and residual stresses prediction is influenced by the shape of
   the fusion zone, the highest thermal tensile stress arising under the
   nailhead of the fusion zone where microfissuring can be observed. (C)

AB The evolution of interfacial deformations and stresses in thermal
   barrier coatings due to the formation of the thermally grown oxide and
   the intrinsic thermal mismatch is investigated. The study focuses on
   systems that are prone to displacement instabilities of the thermally
   grown oxide and numerical models spanning a range of properties are
   investigated. Material changes in the Pt-modified aluminide bond-coat,
   such as martensitic transformation and the change from beta- to
   gamma'-grains, are considered. The numerical simulations show that when
   the mismatch is large enough to cause overall yielding in the bond-coat,
   the thermal expansion of the substrate (the superalloy) will rule the
   system response. Furthermore, the results suggest that the stresses and
   the interfacial deformation-thus the coating's lifetime-may be optimized
   if the martensitic transition temperature can be controlled for
   bond-coats undergoing such transformations. However, we show that due to
   the sensitivity of the system, this is unlikely to be successful for a
   real material system. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The addition of ruthenium can control Topologically Close Packed (TCP)
   phases precipitation in nickel-base superalloys. Thus it becomes
   possible to add more solid solution strengthening elements such as

   superalloys, with platinum group metals (PGMs) elements such as
   ruthenium, show superior creep strengths, although the change in the TCP
   phases crystallography or compositions have not yet been reported. This
   study was carried out based on a 3rd generation nickel-base SC
   superalloy, TMS-121, which contains 5 mass pct rhenium and is known to
   precipitate TCP phases; a series of alloys with different amounts of
   ruthenium addition to TMS-121, TMS-138 and TMS-138 +, were cast and heat
   treated in a variety of time and temperature conditions. TEM
   microstructural observations at different aging time and temperatures
   showed that, R phase, which is the most harmful phase in TCP phases with
   large amounts of gamma'envelope, disappeared by the addition of
   ruthenium. It was also found that 2 mass% ruthenium addition increased
   the solubility limit of multi-phase nickel-base superalloys by about
   7-8%.

AB A technique has been developed for the removal of oxides that often
   cover fracture surfaces of Ni-Cr superalloys following high-temperature
   failures in air. The technique consists of two steps. The sample is
   first boiled in a potassium permanganate solution for I h and then
   electrolytically cleaned in an alkaline solution for 5 min with the
   sample as the cathode. An oxide-free fracture surface of the HAYNES (R)
   23 (R) alloy was prepared by tensile overload at room temperature. The
   fracture surface was then subjected to a thermal exposure at 927 degrees
   C in air. As the exposure time increased, a tenacious oxide film
   developed and became thicker, making it impossible to identify the mode
   of fracture. Except for dislodging the carbides, the technique developed
   was capable of removing the oxides completely without altering the
   fracture surface morphology. (c) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

   in the oxide scale and the growth rates of oxide scales were precisely

   spectrometry. Mn spinels formed on the top surface of oxide scales for
   both Fe-Cr and Ni-Cr alloys. Oxide scale thickness grew with annealing
   time by a parabolic relationship, and the growth rates were in the

AB In this study a series of NiAl-0.1Hf coatings were deposited onto
   Ni-base superalloy (CMSX-4) substrates at various substrate temperatures
   and working gas pressures, using direct current (dc) magnetron
   sputtering. Postdeposition microstructural and chemical analyses using
   scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and
   electron probe microanalysis techniques showed the as-deposited coatings
   to consist of single phase columnar NiAl grains. It was additionally
   observed that the structural morphology of the coatings could be altered
   by changing the substrate temperature and Ar pressure. The general
   trends were in accord with the structure zone model proposed by Thornton
   [J. A. Thornton, Annu. Rev. Mater Sci. 2, 239 (1977)], however the
   temperature ranges for each microstructure occurred at lower
   temperatures. Annealing in argon at 1273 K for 1 h resulted in some
   grain growth and in the formation of a small interdiffusion zone between
   the coating and substrate. After oxidation at 1323 K, the 8 phase
   gradually transformed to gamma' due to Al depletion caused by oxidation
   and interdiffusion. Coatings deposited at higher substrate temperatures
   were observed to have larger grains and to exhibit higher resistance to
   oxidation. This improvement is attributed to a lower volume fraction of
   grain boundaries in those coatings. (C) 2005 American Vacuum Society.

   composite grains with an off-plane oriented gamma-gamma' fibrous

   The evolution of these structures is discussed within the scope of
   crystal growth behavior. The dominant occurrence of face-centered cubic
   at the expense of body-centered phases observed in as-sprayed coatings
   is attributed to their higher growth rates on quenching. Also benefiting
   from rapid growth h the fibrous eutectic grains will form. hereby
   relying on essentially binary phase compositions of highly extended
   solubility ranges. Accumulation of alloy constituents like Cr and Ti by
   segregation to the growth front is considered to pave the way for the
   evolution of amorphous grains at the coating surface on top of

AB Powder metallurgy processed Udimet 720 is a high creep strength
   nickel-based superalloy considered for high temperature turbine disks
   for nuclear gas cooled reactors working under 700degreesC. Both
   fine-grained and coarse-grained microstructures have been obtained by
   applying respectively a subsolvus or a supersolvus solution treatments,
   followed by ageing treatments. In both microstructures, the distribution
   of the strengthening gamma' precipitates has been characterized by
   transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The creep curves of the
   coarse-grained microstructure show the three usual creep stages. On the
   contrary, the creep curves of the fine-grained microstructure show a
   transition directly from primary to apparent tertiary creep without any
   obvious steady state. According to TEM analyses, Orowan loops surround
   Udimet 720 CR gamma' and U720 HS gamma' at high stress whereas U720 HS
   gamma' are sheared at low stress. To describe the behaviour of the
   superalloy Udimet 720, a specific creep model is developed on the basis
   of McLean and Dyson models including physical damage parameters. (C)

AB Quality of castings is partly affected by the type and extent of
   residual stresses, which may lead to undesirable distortions and
   dimensional changes in critical parts and components. The effect of
   pouring temperature on residual stress in Ni-base superalloys, IN713C
   and U500, was investigated using a cutting technique, followed by
   measurements of the change in the distance between prescribed markings.
   For this purpose, rectangular and triangular shape samples were cast
   under vacuum using investment casting process. It was found that
   increasing melt superheat temperature leads to higher levels of casting
   residual stresses. The extent of residual stresses were also found to
   depend on the casting shape, being higher in the triangular sample due
   to local variations in casting modulus. Furthermore, it was found that
   higher levels of residual stresses are developed in U500 compared to
   IN713C, at constant melt superheat temperatures. The differences are
   explained in terms of variations in the freezing range and
   thermo-mechanical properties with alloy chemical composition. (C) 2004

AB Microstructural changes in a metallic oxidation protection coating
   (Ni-Co-Cr-Al-Y) applied on a nickel base superalloy were investigated by
   means of scanning and transmission electron microscopy. The changes are
   due either to thermal mechanical fatigue testing under high thermal
   gradients or to defined isothermal heat treatments. The coated specimens
   were quenched from temperatures between 840 and 1100degreesC to ambient
   temperature. The resultant phases, their local distribution and
   compositions were determined by energy dispersive X-ray (EDX)
   spectroscopy and electron diffraction. Phase equilibria at respective
   temperatures were determined by thermodynamic calculations based on the
   CALPHAD method. The calculated and experimentally determined phase
   distributions were compared. A particular microstructural feature,
   namely the existence and spatial distribution of spherical gamma'
   Ni(3)Al precipitates in the coating and the diffusion zone between
   substrate and coating, was used as a postmortem indicator for the
   maximum temperature experienced by the specimen during testing. This
   paper gives a road map for developing a microstructural-based
   temperature calibration for complex metallic materials using

AB Alloy 59 is a Ni base alloy, which has a nominal chemical composition of
   59% Ni, 16% Mo, 23% Cr and 1% Fe. Exposure of the alloy to high
   temperature effects can result, depending on the prevailing thermal
   conditions, in the precipitation of second phases, thus profoundly
   affecting the alloy properties. Accordingly, the present work was
   initiated with the purpose of investigating microstructural evolution of
   the alloy, focusing on the nanoscale and microscale second phase
   precipitation brought about by isothermal aging. The aging treatment was
   carried out at two different temperatures (700 and 900 degreesC) for
   time intervals varying between 1 and 100 h. Electron microscopy
   observations have revealed the presence, in both the as-received and
   aged alloy, of a large population of nanoscale precipitates
   corresponding to the Ni(Mo,Cr)(2) phase. In addition, the aged specimens
   were found to contain microscale Ni-2(MO,Cr)(2) particles, formed at the
   grain boundaries as well as within the grains. Transmission electron
   microscopy (TEM) observations, made on specimens taken from the heat
   affected zone of a welded plate, have revealed the absence of microscale
   precipitates, and microstructural features thus remained similar to
   those of the as received alloy. Accordingly, the susceptibility of the
   alloy to pit corrosion within the heat affected zone cannot be linked to
   the formation of Mo-Cr rich precipitates. (C) 2004 Published by Elsevier

AB The process dependence of Ir-based-alloy-coated Ni-based single crystal
   superalloys was investigated. An Ir-4 at%Ta alloy, 10 mum thick, was
   coated on a Ni-based single crystal superalloy TMS-82+, by means of
   magnetron sputtering deposition (SD) and electron beam physical vapor
   deposition (EB-PVD). X-ray analysis revealed that the grain size of the
   as-SD-coated layer (similar to20 nm) has five times smaller than that of
   the as-EB-PVD coated layer (similar to100nm), and the SD-coated
   specimens showed more rapid outer diffusion of Ni and Al from the
   substrate after annealing, than the EB-PVD-coated ones. On the other
   hand, the aluminizing treatment reduces the differences between the SD
   coated and EB-PVD coated specimens in terms of compositional
   distribution and oxidation resistance. This study also revealed that
   even without aluminizing, the simple annealing treatment enhances the
   oxidation resistance of the Ir-4%Ta-coated TMS-82+.

AB Hot section components in high-performance aircraft and rocket engines
   are increasingly being made of single crystal nickel superalloys such as
   PWA1480, PWA1484, CMSX-4, and Rene N-4 as these materials provide
   superior creep, stress rupture, melt resistance, and thermomechanical
   fatigue capabilities over their polycrystalline counterparts.
   Fatigue-failures in PWA1480 single crystal nickel-base superalloy
   turbine blades used in the space shuttle main engine fuel turbopump are
   discussed. During testing many turbine blades experienced stage II
   noncrystallographic fatigue cracks with multiple origins at the core
   leading edge radius and extending down the airfoil span along the core
   surface. The longer cracks transitioned from stage II fatigue to
   crystallographic stage I fatigue propagation, on octahedral planes. An
   investigation of crack depths on the population of blades as a function
   of secondary crystallographic orientation (beta) revealed that for
   beta=45 +/- 15 deg tip cracks arrested after some growth or did not
   initiate at all. Finite element analysis of stress response at the blade
   tip, as a function of primary and secondary crystal orientation,
   revealed that there are preferential beta orientations for which crack
   growth is minimized at the blade tip. To assess blade fatigue life and
   durability extensive testing of uniaxial single crystal specimens with
   different orientations has been tested over a wide temperature range in
   air and hydrogen. A detailed analysis of the experimentally determined
   low cycle fatigue properties for PWA1480 and SC 7-14-6 single crystal
   materials as a function of specimen crystallographic orientation is
   presented at high temperature (75degreesF-1800degreesF) in high-pressure
   hydrogen and air Fatigue failure parameters are investigated for low
   cycle fatigue data of single crystal material based on the shear stress
   amplitudes on the 24 octahedral and 6 cube slip systems for FCC single
   crystals. The max shear stress amplitude [Deltatau(max)] on the slip
   planes reduces the scatter in the low cycle fatigue data and is found to
   be a good fatigue damage parameter, especially at elevated temperatures.
   The parameter Delta tau(max) did not characterize the room temperature
   low cycle fatigue data in high-pressure hydrogen well because of the
   noncrystallographic eutectic failure mechanism activated by hydrogen at
   room temperature. Fatigue life equations are developed for various
   temperature ranges and environmental conditions based on power-law curve
   fits of the failure parameter with low cycle fatigue test data. These
   curve fits can be used for assessing blade fatigue life.

AB The microstructures of three single crystal superalloys (CMSX4, CM186LC

   characterised quantitatively following quenched directional
   solidification to identify variations in the grain selection mechanisms.
   No significant differences in the dendrite morphologies of the alloys
   were observed. Detailed observation of dendrites in directionally
   solidified bicrystals of CMSX4 with well-controlled misorientations
   showed significant modification of the growth of secondary dendrites at
   the developing seeded grain boundary. The generally accepted criterion
   of overgrowth by secondary dendrites cannot account for the present
   results. It is proposed that the diffuse textures that are frequently
   produced in second and third generation superalloys are a consequence of
   the inhibition of secondary dendrite development due to competing solute
   diffusion fields. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The influence of various heat treatment conditions on the kinetics of
   gamma' dissolution, re-precipitation and growth in nickel base
   superalloy Udimet 720 (U720) was studied. Cubical shape samples were
   extracted from a forged blade and solution treated at 1110, 1140, 1150,
   1160 and 1170degreesC for holding times ranging from 2 to 24 h. Samples
   were quenched at the end of each heat treatment process and the
   dissolution kinetics of gamma' precipitates was studied using optical
   and scanning electron microscopy. The gamma' solvus temperature was
   determined to be approximately of 1150degreesC for the investigated
   alloy. Samples were aged at 760 and 850degreesC from 2 to 90 h to study
   precipitation and growth kinetics of gamma' precipitates. A
   Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner (LSW) type relationship was found, leading to an
   activation energy value of 250kJ/mol for the growth of cuboidal shape
   gamma' precipitates. A methodology was developed to take into account
   the temperature dependence of the growth coefficient, k, in the LSW
   equation. This results in more accurate evaluation of the activation
   energy value, compared to the general practice that assumes a
   temperature independent value for k. A heat treatment map for the Udimet
   720 alloy studied in this investigation is proposed. The reference graph
   could be used to estimate -y' volume fraction and size at different
   times and temperatures allowing the development of heat treatment
   schedules. The methodology employed in this investigation could be
   applied to other types of nickel base superalloys. (C) 2004 Elsevier

   photo-stimulated luminescence spectroscopy, optical microscopy, scanning
   electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy before and
   after high-temperature oxidation. As-deposited DCS contained varying
   amounts of alpha-, gamma-Al2O3 and amorphous phases depending on the
   chemistry and surface characteristics of the substrate. Heat treatment
   at 1121 degreesC (2050 degreesF) for 2 h in air facilitated complete
   phase transformation to equilibrium alpha-Al2O3 in the DCS. Improvement
   in oxidation resistance was observed or DCS specimens during 250-h
   oxidation at 1121 degreesC (2050 degreesF). In particular, DCS was found
   to be very effective as an external coating on the rough (as-sprayed)
   NiCrAlY surface. The superior oxidation resistance of the specimens with
   DCS may be attributed to the formation of slow-growing and adherent
   alumina scale and the prevention of Ni/Cr-rich oxide formation. (C) 2003

   was refined to ASTM 8-10 grade by controlling the thermal processing and
   the heat treatment. The tensile specimens fail by intergranular fracture
   even when the phosphorus level is as high as 0.140% (mass fraction). The
   yield and ultimate strengths of the refined alloy are 200 and 150 MPa
   higher than that of the alloy with a standard microstructure of ASTM 4-5
   grain size, respectively. And the above two strengths of the alloy with
   0.140% phosphorus are 100 and 50 MPa higher than those of the alloy with
   a industrial controlled phosphorus level, say 0.005%. The impact
   specimens fail by intragranular fracture when the phosphorus level is
   below 0.023% and the fracture toughness of the alloy is higher than 70
   MJ/m(2). Some parts of the fracture surface of the impact specimen with
   0.140% phosphorus exhibited intergranular fracture characteristics and
   the fracture toughness is lowered to about 40 MJ/m(2). Phosphorus
   extends the rupture life of the GH4133 alloy and its optimum addition is
   around 0.011%. The interaction between phosphorus atmosphere and

   different type of mechanical properties.

AB The tension and compression creep behaviour of an as-received and
   pre-aged IN100 disc alloy have been characterised in order to validate a
   previous hypothesis that the unusual response of low and even negative
   initial creep rates in tension was caused by the presence of an internal
   stress field within the alloy. Absolute values of initial creep rates in
   compression were found to be much greater than in tension and this
   asymmetric creep response is conclusive proof of the presence of an
   internal compressive stress field in the alloy matrix. The asymmetry was
   virtually removed by pre-ageing prior to creep and this is attributed to
   the decay of the internal stress. These features have been simulated
   using a microstructure-based creep model incorporating an evolving
   internal stress field. The model also simulates the additional (and
   complicating) reduction in general creep strength that is thought to be
   due to coarsening and dissolution of the smallest particles of the
   tri-modal gamma' distribution in the alloy. The net consequence of these
   two competing thermal processes is that the short-term creep response is
   dominated by the initial magnitude of the internal stress field whereas
   coarsening, and dissolution of the smallest gamma' particles determines
   the long-term behaviour. (C) 2003 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by

AB Unconventional plasma sprayed thermal barrier coating (TBC) systems were
   produced and evaluated by interrupted or cyclic furnace oxidation life
   testing. First, approximately 250 mum thick 8YSZ coatings were directly
   sprayed onto grit blasted surfaces of PWA 1484, without a bond coat, to
   take advantage of the excellent oxidation resistance of this superalloy.
   For nominal sulfur (S) contents of 1 ppmw, total coating separation took
   place at relatively short times (200 h at 1100 degreesC). Reductions in
   the S content, by melt desulfurization commercially (0.3 ppmw) or by
   hydrogen (H(2)) annealing in the laboratory (0.01 ppmw), improved scale
   adhesion and extended life appreciably, by factors of 5-10. However,
   edge-initiated failure persisted, producing massive delamination as one
   sheet of coating. Secondly, surfaces of melt desulfurized PWA 1484 were
   machined with a grid of grooves or ribs (similar to250 mum wide and
   high), resulting in a segmented TBC surface macrostructure, for the
   purpose of subverting this failure mechanism. In this case, failure
   occurred only as independent, single-segment events. For grooved
   samples, 1100 degreesC segment life was extended to similar to1000 h for
   5 mm wide segments, with no failure observed out to 2000 h for segments
   less than or equal to2.5 mm wide. Ribbed samples were even more durable,
   and segments less than or equal to6 mm remained intact for 2000 h.
   Larger segments failed by buckling at times inversely related to the
   segment width and decreased by oxidation effects at higher temperatures.
   This critical buckling size was consistent with that predicted for
   elastic buckling of a TBC plate subject to thermal expansion mismatch
   stresses. Thus, low S substrates demonstrate appreciable coating lives
   without a bond coat, while rib segmenting extends life considerably.

AB Different metallurgical processing, including the standard heat
   treatment, heat treatment without beta aging, addition of high amount of
   Cr, and long-term isothermal exposure, was conducted on superalloy
   Inconel 783. For these processed materials, the tensile property and
   hardness at room temperature and stress relaxation behavior at 650
   degreesC were examined. The testing results showed that isothermal
   exposure and heat treatment without P aging slightly enhanced the yield
   strength of alloy 783 at room temperature as well as all metallurgical
   processing in this study produced an identical stress relaxation
   behavior at 650 degreesC. The microstructure variation with different
   processing was analyzed using optical microscope, scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).

AB Ni-base directionally solidified (DS) superalloys have an advantage of
   production costs over single crystal (SC) superalloys because of better
   yield rate of casting and simpler heat treatment compared with SC
   superalloys. In this study, we designed a 4th generation DS superalloy,
   TMD-111, based on our 5th generation SC superalloy, TMS-162, containing
   5 mass%Ru; we added C and B on TMS-162 to strengthen the grain
   boundaries. The alloy was directionally solidified and heat treated
   under four different conditions, i.e., as cast, as solution treated,
   solution treated and aged, and solution treated and two step aged. The
   solution treated and two step aged sample showed the highest creep
   strength, although the effect of heat treatment was found to be
   relatively small. All the samples except for as cast ones showed longer
   1% creep strain under a 1100degreesC/137 MPa compared with that of
   CMSX-10, a typical third generation SC superalloy.

AB The high temperature deformation behaviour of nickel base superalloy
   Udimet 520 was characterised using hot compression isothermal tests. Hot
   compression tests were conducted between 900 and 1150degreesC with
   strain rates of 0-001, 0-01, 0-1 and 1 s(-1). Testing at less than or
   equal to950degreesC led to sample fracture for all the applied strain
   rates. The flow behaviour at 1000, 1050 and 1075degreesC indicated the
   occurrence of dynamic recovery. For specimens tested at 1100, 1125 and
   1150degreesC, recrystallisation is the softening mechanism. The strain
   rate sensitivity factor m was estimated for various thermomechanical
   histories. The activation energy for the hot deformation was determined
   to be 780 kJ mol(1). The Zener-Hollomon parameter was also determined
   and its variation with grain size was studied with deformation
   conditions. The microstructures of all samples were examined by both
   optical and scanning electron microscopy. The presence and variations in
   the morphology and size distribution of deformed and recrystallised
   grains were determined and related to the deformation conditions.

AB The microstructural changes in a single-crystal Ni-base superalloy,
   CMSX-4, that might occur during the processes of repair and recoating of
   hot section components for advanced gas turbines were studied. It is
   shown that the cellular gamma/gamma' microstructure is formed when the
   material is subjected to local plastic straining, followed by the reheat
   treatments during the course of damage recovery. The formation of
   cellular microstructure in the material led to the remarkably reduced
   fatigue strength. In order to reduce or prevent the preceding
   undesirable effect resulting from cellular microstructure, a new method
   based on applying overlay coating technique was developed. The method is
   based on an idea that the alloying elements that are depleted in base
   alloys could be supplemented via the overlay coating. An X alloy, which
   contains grain boundary strengthening elements, was selected and coated
   on the CMSX-4 with the cellular microstructure by low-pressure plasma
   spraying. The fatigue tests on the coated CMSX-4 specimens demonstrated
   the effectiveness of the method. The observations of the crack
   initiation site, the fatigue fracture mode, the crack density in the
   cellular transformed area, and the crack propagation morphologies near
   the prior interface strongly supported the validity of this approach.
   The method is expected to build a road to a so-called damage cure (or
   recovery) coating.

AB Crystalline NiAl-0.1 Hf coatings, similar to20-mum thick, were deposited
   onto CMSX-4((R)) substrates using direct current (DC) magnetron
   sputtering. The as-deposited coatings were found to be single phase,
   consisting of beta-NiAl (B2 structure). Annealing in argon at 1000
   degreesC for 1 h resulted in densification of the coatings and in
   increased adhesion between the coatings and the substrate.
   Microstructural and compositional changes of the coating system after
   isothermal oxidation were studied using scanning electron microscopy
   (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) techniques. The
   mechanical properties of the coatings were studied via nanoindentation
   in the as-deposited condition, after annealing, and following various
   oxidation heat treatments. The hardness and modulus of the coatings were
   observed to correlate with oxidation time. Extended oxidation resulted
   in decreased hardness due to grain growth, precipitate coarsening and
   the diffusion of solutes into and out of the coating. The results are
   discussed relative to conventional CVD aluminide coatings. (C) 2003

AB The thermal expansion mismatch between a metallic substrate and its
   external oxide scale generates a strain on cooling that is a primary
   cause of spallation of protective oxide scales. This study compares
   thermal expansion behavior and cyclic oxidation performance of the two
   major composition classes of high-temperature commercial coatings for
   protection of single-crystal superalloys. The thermal expansion of cast
   MCrAlY (M = Ni and/or Co) alloys and cast aluminides (NiAl, (Ni,Pt)Al
   and Ni(3)Al) was measured at temperatures up to 1300degreesC and
   compared to that of a single-crystal Ni-base superalloy. The tendency
   for scale spallation from each alloy was evaluated by cyclic oxidation
   testing at 1150degreesC. The coefficients of thermal expansion for the
   aluminides were lower than those of the MCrAlY-based alloys at all
   temperatures and scale adherence to the Hf-doped aluminides was
   generally superior. Scale adherence to the various compositions of
   MCrAlY-type alloys did not directly correlate to their thermal expansion
   behavior or substrate strength. For both types of materials, the
   presence of a reactive element (Y,Hf, etc.) had no detectable effect on
   thermal expansion but a major effect on scale adherence. There was no
   obvious influence of At content on the thermal expansion of beta phase
   Ni-Al compositions. The addition of Pt resulted in a lower average
   thermal expansion for hyperstoichiometric (Ni,Pt)AI at temperatures
   above 930degreesC, but this effect was not observed in
   hypostoichiometric (Ni,Pt)AI.

AB The weak-beam technique of transmission electron microscopy has been
   used to analyse a new shearing configuration of gamma' precipitates
   after creep at 700degreesC of a Ni-based superalloy for gas turbine
   discs. The shearing configurations are made up of superlattice extrinsic
   stacking faults, matrix stacking faults and individual (a/6)<112>
   Shockley dislocations. This mechanism is initiated by the decorrelated
   movement of the two Shockley partials of a single (a/2)<110> matrix
   dislocation. The propagation of the leading partial creates this
   shearing process. This phenomenon that occurs in small g channels owing
   to the flexibility of dislocations can be used to evaluate
   microstructural evolutions during ageing in the alloy.

AB The degradation of a platinum modified aluminide (PtAl) coating and a
   CMSX-4 superalloy substrate were investigated for cyclic and
   quasi-isothermal heating to 1200 degreesC. To accelerate the oxidation
   on the specimens the thermally grown oxide (TGO) was removed at 10 h
   intervals. For up to 80 h of exposure comparisons of specimens with
   periodic oxide removal and those without oxide removal were made.
   Qualitatively, the major changes to bond coat were associated with phase
   changes from beta-(Ni,Pt)Al to gamma'-(Ni(3)Al) and precipitate
   coarsening. This evolution was quantified through backscatter scanning
   electron microcopy and image analysis. With instrumented indentation,
   the room temperature coating modulus was also measured at 10 h
   intervals. Additional results include observations of differences in
   waviness of the bond coat surface for cyclic, quasi-isothermal, and
   true-isothermal heating, and observations of rafting near the
   substrate/coating interface. The differences between cyclic and
   quasi-isothermal heating indicate that stresses associated with cooling
   and heating significantly alter microstructural evolution. (C) 2002
