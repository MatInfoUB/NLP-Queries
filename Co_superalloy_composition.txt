TI Improvement of the high temperature oxidation of TaC-strengthened
   Co(Cr)-based cast superalloys by the addition of nickel
SO CORROSION ENGINEERING SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB In this work, nickel is added in substitution to cobalt in the composition of a cast cobalt-based chromium-rich superalloy designed to obtain a double-phased {fcc matrix + TaC} microstructure. Two nickel amounts were tested, 13 and 26 wt-%Ni, for 25 wt-%Cr, 0.4 wt-%C and 6 wt-%Ta, the rest being cobalt. The obtained as-cast microstructures are not different from the starting alloy's one, contrarily to the hardness which became lower. The oxidation tests at 1200 degrees C for 170 h demonstrated a significant improvement of the alloy's behaviour, especially for an addition of 26 wt-%Ni. This seems to be attributed to an easier Cr diffusion towards the oxidation front as suggested by the observed Cr contents in extreme surface as well as by the lower Cr concentration gradients. In addition, the TaC seemed to be morphologically more stable in the presence of nickel in the alloys than in the absence of Ni.

TI Microstructure and mechanical behavior at elevated temperatures of a
   novel nickel base superalloy heavily alloyed with forming and
   substitution elements
SO LETTERS ON MATERIALS
AB A novel nickel base superalloy heavily alloyed with gamma' forming and substitution elements, particularly with rhenium and tungsten, has been proposed in the present work as a potential die material for die forging of the most hard-to-deform nickel base superalloys. The superalloy composition is Ni-13(Al, Ti, Nb, Ta)-27(Cr, Co, Mo, W, Re, Si, C, B) (wt.%). The superalloy ingot was manufactured by vacuum induction melting. Microstructure examination showed that the as-cast condition was characterized by a coarse grained dendritic structure consisted of coarse gamma grains containing gamma' precipitates with a size 0.3 -1 mu m and primary gamma' particles with a size 5 -100 mu m. A small amount of carbides and topologically close packed (TCP) phases was also detected. The microstructure examination suggests that the general solidification pathway was L ->gamma ->gamma', as it is in nickel base superalloys. At the same time, the primary gamma' particles were probably formed via the peritectic reaction L-noneq + gamma ->gamma', where L-noneq is the nonequilibrium liquid, which was retained at the peritectic temperature. The superalloy was subjected to heat treatment including solid solution treatment and ageing. The heat treatment led to coagulation of the primary gamma' phase and to a slight decrease in the volume fractions of carbides and TCP phases. The heat treated condition was used to prepare samples for compression tests, which were performed at 900-1200 degrees C up to the true strain e= 0.1. The yield strength of the novel superalloy was generally appreciably higher as compared with those of known nickel base superalloys and alloys based on the Ni3Al intermetallic phase.

TI Identifying heating rate dependent oxidation reactions on a nickel-based
   superalloy using synchrotron diffraction
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB Synchrotron grazing incidence X-ray diffraction has been used to newly reveal the heating rate dependent oxidation reactions that develop on a polycrystalline nickel-based superalloy. A continuous layer of precursor oxide was shown to form during the heating stage. Their approximate growth rates, their effect on local surface compositions of the alloy substrate, and their degree of interface planarity are considered critical in determining subsequent oxidation reactions when held for extended thermal exposures. The precursor oxides were predominantly nickel or cobalt based (NiO/CoO and Co3O4/NiCo2O4). Following the fastest heating rates (40 degrees C min(-1) and above), the stable Cr2O3 phase formed, inhibiting Ni or Co diffusion to the surface. At slower heating rates (10-20 degrees C min(-1)), no evidence of the stable Cr2O3 was found, even after 200 h at elevated thermal exposure, instead continued growth of the precursor oxides was observed. Heating at 5 degrees C min(-1) gave rise to an intriguing zone where sufficient precursor and favourable kinetics enabled the formation of a spinel, NiCr2O4, surface layer. Cross sections observed with electron microscopy confirmed this to be planar and continuous. Heating at the slowest tested 2 degrees C min(-1) contrarily gives a non-protective surface layer comprising an outwardly growing NiO/CoO precursor oxide on top of an inwardly growing mixed oxide. The quantities, interfacial morphologies of oxides of the precursor oxide grown and the possible thermodynamic reactions that lead to their formation are discussed.

TI Effect of Re on microstructure and mechanical properties of gamma/gamma
   ' Co-Ti-based superalloys
SO INTERMETALLICS
AB Three compositions of Re containing Co-Ti-based alloys with gamma/gamma' two-phase microstructure were obtained based on the determined phase relationship in the Co-rich corner at 800 degrees C. The effect of Re on microstructure, elemental partition behavior, thermodynamic properties, lattice parameter misfits, mechanical properties and gamma' coarsening behavior of the Co-Ti-Re alloys were investigated. The gamma/gamma' lattice parameter misfit of the alloys decreases from 0.72% to 0.50%, and the gamma' coarsening rate constant K of alloys decreases from 0.30 x 10(-27) m(3) s(-1) to 0.073 x 10(-27) m(3) s(-1) as Re content increasing form 1 at. % to 5 at. %. Additionally, the volume fraction of gamma' phase (V-gamma') increases from 42.15% to 53.19% and the gamma' solvus temperature increases from 1059 degrees C to 1085 degrees C (Tsolvus-gamma') with increasing Re content. Moreover, the 0.2% flow stresses and the 0.2% specific flow stresses of all three alloys exhibit negative temperature dependence at the temperatures ranging from room temperature to 900 degrees C. And both the 0.2% flow stresses and the 0.2% specific flow stresses increase with the Re content.

TI Correlative Nano-Computed Tomography and Focused Ion-Beam Sectioning: A
   Case Study on a Co-Base Superalloy Oxide Scale
SO ADVANCED ENGINEERING MATERIALS
AB Herein, the capabilities of a correlative tomography approach combining laboratory nano X-ray computed tomography, focused ion-beam sectioning, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy are utilized for the characterization of multilayered oxide scales of Co-base superalloys regarding their 3D morphology and chemical composition. The combination of complementary 3D imaging techniques allows for a precise and reliable segmentation of the pore space, oxide precipitates, and different phases of the initial material. Such information is instrumental to a microscopic understanding of oxidation in this new class of superalloys and key to improvement of oxidation resistance in the next-generation high-temperature materials.

TI Identification of Laves phases in a Zr or Hf containing gamma-gamma'
   Co-base superalloy
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB ZrCo2 and HfCo2 Laves phases were found and characterized in gamma-gamma' Co-base superalloys using high-energy X-ray diffraction, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy. They formed during casting and are stable during long-term annealing at 900 degrees C. The ZrCo2 phase with a cubic MgCu2-type structure exhibits numerous nano-twins and stacking faults, while HfCo2 has a hexagonal MgNi2-type structure instead of MgCu2-type in contrast to literature. Their chemical compositions strongly deviated from stoichiometry and significant amounts of Al and Ware contained in these phases. These could affect the atomic radius ratio and valence electron concentration and thus change the structure of the Laves phases. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI On the Development Concept for a New 718-Type Superalloy with Improved
   Temperature Capability
SO METALS
AB The superalloy 718 stands out for its excellent manufacturability and strength at ambient temperature. However, its application temperature is limited to about 650 degrees C due to the instability of the gamma '' precipitates. Here, we provide an in-depth account of an alloy development concept, allowing for the design of superalloys with 718-type properties, yet with a significantly improved microstructural stability. The article begins with a detailed discussion on how the microstructural and chemical composition must be altered to achieve this objective. Then, model alloys were used to explore and validate the outlined strategy. Finally, it is shown how these considerations ultimately led to a new 718-type superalloy with far more improved microstructural stability-namely, VDM Alloy 780. The introduction of a large amount of Co as a substitute for Fe (and partially Ni) is the most important element of our alloy development concept in terms of chemical composition. The most important microstructural feature is the introduction of low solvus temperature, high misfit gamma'-strengthening, replacing gamma ''-hardening.

TI Element Segregation and Solidification Behavior of a Nb, Ti, Al
   Co-Strengthened Superalloy & x42d;K151
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA-ENGLISH LETTERS
AB The as-cast microstructure, element segregation and solidification behavior of a multi-alloyed superalloy & x42d;K151 have been investigated. The results show that the severe element segregation leads to the complicated precipitations at the inter-dendritic region, including eta-Ni-3(Ti, Nb), eutectic (gamma + gamma ') and Laves, which shows the characteristics of both Ti, Al-strengthened and Nb-strengthened alloys. Differential thermal analysis, heating and quenching tests reveal the solidification sequence as follows: Liquids -> gamma matrix -> (Nb, Ti)C -> eta-Ni-3(Ti, Nb) -> eutectic (gamma + gamma ') -> Laves. The melting points are between 1250 and 1260 degrees C for (Nb, Ti)C, between 1200 and 1210 degrees C for eta phase, between 1180 and 1190 degrees C for eutectic (gamma + gamma ') and Laves. gamma ' initially precipitates from matrix at 1150 degrees C and achieves the maximum precipitation at 1130 degrees C. According to the microstructure evolution captured during solidification and composition analysis by an energy dispersive spectrometer and electron probe microanalyzer, (Nb, Ti)/Al ratio is put forward to explain the formation of eta-Ni-3(Ti, Nb) and eutectic (gamma + gamma '). The solidification of gamma matrix increased the Nb, Ti concentration in the residual liquids, so the high (Nb, Ti)/Al ratio would result in the formation of eta-Ni-3(Ti, Nb); the precipitation of the phase consumed Nb and Ti and decreased the (Nb, Ti)/Al ratio in the liquid, which led to the precipitation of eutectic (gamma + gamma '). Laves formed by the sides of eta-Ni-3(Ti, Nb) and in front of the eutectic (gamma + gamma ') after Al, Ti were further depleted by the two phases and Cr, Co, Mo were rejected to liquids.

TI On the high temperature coarsening kinetics of gamma ' precipitates in a
   high strength Co37.6Ni35.4Al9.9Mo4.9Cr5.9Ta2.8Ti3.5 fcc-based high
   entropy alloy
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB The paper reports evolution of two-phase microstructure quantitatively in a high entropy alloy of composition Co37.6Ni35.4Al9.9Mo4.9Ta2.8Ti3.5. A very high-volume fraction of ordered L1(2) precipitates forms below its solvus temperature of 1156 degrees C that cannot be suppressed during quenching. The quench microstructure contains nanometric bimodal size distribution of spheroidal and irregular precipitates, both having L1(2) ordering (gamma') and a Co + Ni concentration close to 75 at. %, thus representing a stoichiometry of (Ni,Co)(3) (AI,Cr,Ta,Ti,Mo). The alloy shows hardening on aging with a peak in hardness value at 900 degrees C for 50 h of annealing. The morphology of the precipitates at this stage evolves into cuboidal shape having rounded corners with a lattice mismatch of +0.22% with the matrix. A detailed study of the coarsening behaviour of these precipitates in the matrix of complex solid solution indicates that the coarsening follows a modified LSW mechanism with estimated activation energy of 360 +/- 50 kJ/mol between 900 and 1000 degrees C. This is slightly higher than the activation energy of most of the solutes in gamma Co matrix that does not contain heavy elements like W or Re. The high-volume fraction of the precipitates together with coarsening resistance lead to an attractive high temperature strength that is higher than many of the known superalloys.

TI Microstructural evolution and high-temperature strength of a
   gamma(f.c.c.)/gamma '(L1(2)) Co-Al-W-Ti-B superalloy
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB We characterized the microstructural features and mechanical performance of a model Co-5.6Al-5.8W-6.6Ti-0.12B (at.%) alloy consisting of gamma(L1(2))-precipitates in a gamma(f.c.c.)-matrix. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to follow the isothermal aging of the micro-structure at 900 and 1000 degrees C for 256 h, and 950 degrees C for 1000 h. The compositions of the gamma'(L1(2))-precipitates and gamma(f.c.c.)-matrix were evaluated by atom-probe tomography (APT) for solution-treated and air-cooled conditions, as well as in specimens aged at 950 degrees C for 16 and 100 h. Boron was shown to partition preferentially to the gamma'(L1(2))-precipitates, and profiles taken across the gamma(f.c.c.)-matrix channels in both aged specimens revealed confined segregation of A1 at one of the two gamma(f.c.c.)/gamma'(L1(2)) heterophase interfaces. After aging at 950 degrees C for 16 h, Co-5.6Al-5.8W-6.6Ti-0.12B (at.%) exhibited anomalous flow-strength behavior in the range 625-900 degrees C with a peak yield stress of 822 MPa between 800 and 825 degrees C. Compressive creep tests performed at 850 degrees C demonstrated a creep strength comparable to archival literature results for Co-9Al-9W-0.12B (at.%), despite a smaller gamma'(L1(2))-volume fraction and lack of strengthening borides along the grain boundaries (GBs). The activation energy for creep in the temperature range 800-900 degrees C was 606 kJ mol(-1). The post-creep microstructure consists of rafted gamma'(L1(2))-precipitates perpendicular to the compression axis, consistent with the positive gamma(f.c.c.)/gamma'(L1(2)) lattice parameter misfit character of this class of alloys. Creep failure could occur due to GB embrittlement caused by deleterious Ti-rich (L2(1) or B2) and D0(19) phases formed at the GBs during creep. (C) 2019 Acta Materialia Inc.

TI Effect of Al, Ti and Cr additions on the gamma-gamma' microstructure of
   W-free Co-Ta-V-Based superalloys
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB The recently-discovered metastable gamma'-Co-3(Ta0.76V0.24) phase formed on aging in a Co-6Ta-6V (at.%) ternary alloy is stabilized by partial replacement of Ta and V with Al and Ti. In two alloys with composition Co-6Al-3Ta-3V and Co-5Al-3Ta-3V-1Ti with gamma+gamma' microstructure, the gamma'-precipitates remain stable for up to 168 h at 850 and 900 C, with no precipitation of additional phases. Adding Ni and B and doubling the Ti concentration produces a gamma/gamma' superalloy, Co-10Ni-5Al-3Ta-3V-2Ti-0.04B (at.%), with gamma' precipitates which are stable up to six weeks of aging at 850 degrees C, while slowly coarsening and coalescing from cuboidal to elongated shapes. After one day of aging at 850 degrees C, the gamma' nanoprecipitates have a (Co0.83Ni0.17)(3)(Ta0.42Al0.23Ti0.19V0.15B0.01) composition, with Al and Ti replacing at the same rate both Ta and V in the original metastable Co-3(Ta0.76V0.24) phase. To improve oxidation resistance, 4% Cr is added to the new superalloy, resulting in a somewhat higher volume fraction of finer cuboidal gamma' precipitates after one week of aging at 850 degrees C, but no other deleterious phases. These W-and Mo-free gamma/gamma' superalloys show good creep resistance at 850 degrees C, on par with two other recent Co-base gamma/gamma' superalloys: (i) Co-9W-9Al-8Cr (at.%) which has higher density due to its high W content, and (ii) Co-30Ni-10Al-5Mo-2Nb (at.%) which has lower density (as it is W-free) but contains triple the Ni concentration.

TI High-strength Co-Al-V-base superalloys strengthened by gamma
   '-Co-3(Al,V) with high solvus temperature
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB The gamma/gamma' two-phase Co Al V-base superalloys are investigated in detail, including their phase equilibria, alloying effects, and alloy design. The experimental proof of the existence of a ternary compound with an L1(2)-ordered gamma'-Co-3(Al, V) phase is provided in this study, and the gamma/gamma' two-phase Co-5Al-14V (at.%) alloy is designed. The gamma'-Co-3(Al,V) phase is proved to be thermodynamically stable at 900 degrees C, and a wide gamma/gamma' two-phase composition region in the Co-Al-V ternary phase diagram at 900 degrees C is identified. The performed investigation of Co-5Al-14V-2X (X: Ti, Cr, Nb, Mo, Ta, and W) and Co-xNi-8Al-12V (x = 10, 20, and 30) quaternary alloys revealed that Ti, Nb, Mo, Ta, W, and Ni tend to concentrate in the gamma' phase, whereas Cr tends to partition to the gamma matrix. Besides, the gamma/gamma' two-phase Co-30Ni-10Al-5V-4Ta-2Ti (30Ni4Ta2Ti) alloy is designed. The 30Ni4Ta2Ti alloy exhibits a very high gamma' solvus temperature (namely, 1242 +/- 3 degrees C) combined with a low density (8.46 +/- 0.08 g cm(-3)), which characteristics are comparable with those of the Mar-M-247 Ni-base superalloy. Moreover, the nominal and the specific yield strength values of the obtained 30Ni4Ta2Ti alloy within the temperature range from 600 to 900 degrees C are also close to those of the Mar-M-247 superalloy.

TI Isothermal section of Ga-Co-Cu phase diagram at 830 degrees C and its
   peculiarities
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Recently, the Ga-based ternary alloys have gained interest for the possibility of finding new quasicrystals. Inspired by the previously reported decagonal and icosahedral quasicrystals identified in the Ga50Co25Cu25 alloy at 830 degrees C, the phase equilibria of 27 alloys of various composition were investigated in this work. Based on the obtained results, an isothermal section of the Ga-Co-Cu phase diagram at 830 degrees C was proposed. However, neither decagonal nor icosahedral quasicrystals were found to be stable at 830 degrees C, but instead of that, a superalloy-like structure was found in the Ga35Co25Cu40 alloy consisting of beta-GaCo and beta-GaCug-GaCu.

   Superalloy
SO RARE METAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING
AB By using molecular dynamics method with the second nearest neighbor modified embedded-atom method (2NN MEAM) interatomic potential, we studied the gamma/theta-DO22 interfacial structure of Ni-Al-V superalloy at different compositions, and calculated the interfacial energy and the work of separation on the interfaces. The research shows that with the Al atom concentration increasing, the interfacial energy increases while the work of separation decreases; with the concentration of V atoms increasing, the interfacial energy increases first and then decreases; but the change of atomic concentration has little effect on the work of separation; and the interfacial energy and the work of separation are closely related to the interfacial migration. The results can be used to further study the dynamic behavior of Ni-Al-V superalloys in the process of precipitation, such as the composition segregation and interfacial migration, so the research has great guiding significance to the alloy design.

TI On the effect of Re addition on microstructural evolution of a
   CoNi-based superalloy
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB In this study, the effect of rhenium (Re) addition on microstructural evolution of a new low-density Co-Ni-Al-Mo-Nb based superalloy is presented. Addition of Re significantly influences the gamma' precipitate morphology, the gamma/gamma' lattice misfit and the gamma/gamma' microstructural stability during long term aging. An addition of 2 at.% Re to a Co-30Ni-10Al-5Mo-2Nb (all in at.%) alloy, aged at 900 degrees C for 50 h, reduces the gamma/gamma' lattice misfit by similar to 40% (from +0.32% to +0.19%, measured at room temperature) and hence alters the gamma' morphology from cuboidal to round-cornered cuboidal precipitates. The composition profiles across the gamma/gamma' interface by atom probe tomography (APT) reveal Re partitions to the gamma phase (K-Re = 0.34) and also results in the partitioning reversal of Mo to the gamma phase (K-Mo = 0.90) from the gamma' precipitate. An inhomogeneous distribution of Gibbsian interfacial excess for the solute Re (Gamma(Re), ranging from 0.8 to 9.6 atom.nm(-2)) has been observed at the gamma/gamma' interface. A coarsening study at 900 degrees C (up to 1000 h) suggests that the coarsening of gamma' precipitates occurs solely by evaporation-condensation (EC) mechanism. This is contrary to that observed in the Co-30Ni-10Al-5Mo-2Nb alloy as well as in some of the Ni-Al based and high mass density Co-Al-W based superalloys, where gamma' precipitates coarsen by coagulation/coalescence mechanism with an extensive alignment of gamma' along <100> directions as a sign of microstructural instability. The gamma' coarsening rate constant (K-r) and gamma/gamma' interfacial energy are estimated to be 1.13 x 10(-27) m(3)/s and 8.4 mJ/m(2), which are comparable and lower than Co-Al-W based superalloys.

TI Effect of Ti and Al on microstructure and partitioning behavior of
   alloying elements in Ni-based powder metallurgy superalloys
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MINERALS METALLURGY AND MATERIALS
AB The microstructure and partitioning behaviors of alloying elements in the gamma and gamma' phases in Ni-based powder metallurgy superalloys with different Ti and Al contents were investigated. The results showed that Ti and Al were mainly enriched in the gamma' phase, partially partitioned in the gamma matrix, and slightly distributed in the carbides. Different Ti and Al contents in various alloys influenced the composition and amount of MC carbides but did not influence the MC carbides' morphology. With increasing Ti and Al contents, gamma + gamma' fan-type structures formed at the grain boundary, eventually resulting in a coarsened gamma' phase. In addition, the morphology of the secondary gamma' phase transformed from nearly spherical to cuboidal. The saturation degrees of Cr, Co, and Mo in the gamma matrix were substantially improved with increasing Ti and Al contents.

TI Cluster formulas of Co-Al-W-base superalloys
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Having a gamma/gamma' microstructure similar to Ni-base superalloys and also including various alloying elements such as Al and W, new Co-base superalloy, namely Co-Al-W-base alloy, has been widely studied as a kind of potential alternative of Ni-base superalloy, which is the most important high-temperature structural material in industrial applications. Besides, Co-Al-W-base alloy has also excellent mechanical properties, for example, creep properties comparable to those of the first-generation Ni-base single crystal superalloys. In our previous work, the ideal composition formula of Ni-base superalloy has been obtained by applying the cluster-plus-glue-atom structure model of faced centered cubic solid solution, which shows that the most stable chemical short-range-order unit is composed of a nearest-neighbor cluster and three next-neighbor glue atoms. In this paper, the ideal cluster formula of Co-Al-W-base superalloy is addressed by using the same approach. Based on cluster-plusglue-atom model theory, according to lattice constants and atom radii, calculations are carried out. The results show that the atom radius of Al is equal to Covalent radius (0.126 nm) and for gamma' phase the atom radius of W changes obviously (0.1316 nm). After analyzing atomic radii, the chemical formula for Co-Al-W ternary alloy is calculated to be [Al-Co-12](Co,Al,W)(3), which signifies an Al centered atom and twelve Co nearest-neighbored cluster atoms plus three glue atoms, which is in good consistence with that for Ni-base single crystal superalloy. For multi-element alloy, the alloying elements are classified, according to the heat of mixing between the alloying elements and Co as well as partition behavior of alloying elements, as solvent elements-Co-like elements (Co) over bar (Co, Ni, Ir, Ru, Cr, Fe, and Re) and solute elements-Al-like elements (Al) over bar (Al, W, Mo, Ta, Ti, Nb, V, etc.). The solvent elements can be divided into two kinds according to partition behaves: (Co) over bar (gamma) (Cr, Fe, and Re) and (Co) over bar (gamma)' (Ni, Ir, and Ru).
   The latter is further grouped into Al, (W) over bar (W and Mo, which have weaker heat of mixing than Al-Co ) and (Ta) over bar (Ta, Ti, Nb, V, etc., which have stronger heat of mixing than Al-Co). Then all chemically complex Co-Al-W-base superalloys are simplified into (Co) over bar-(Al) over bar pseudo-binary or (Co) over bar -Al-(W) over bar, (Ta) over bar pseudo-ternary system. Within the framework of the cluster-plus-glue-atom formulism and by analyzing the compositions of alloy, it is shown that the Co-Al-W-base superalloy satisfies the ideal formula [(Al) over bar-(Co) over bar (12)] ((Co) over bar (1.0)(Al) over bar (2.0)) (or [(Al) over bar-(Co) over bar Al-1.0(0.5)((W) over bar,(Ta) over bar)(1.5) = (Co) over bar (81.250)(Al) over bar9.375 ((W) over bar, (Ta) over bar)(9.375) at.%). In the same way, those of gamma and gamma' phases are respectively [(Al) over bar-(Co) over bar (12)] ((Co) over bar (1.5)(Al) over bar (1.5)) (or [Al-(Co) over bar (12)] (Co) over bar Al-0.5(2.5)((W) over bar, (Ta) over bar)(1.0 )= (Co) over bar Al-84.375(9.375)((W) over bar, (Ta) over bar)(6.250) at.%) and (Al) over bar-(Co) over bar (12)((Co) over bar (0.5 )(Al) over bar (2.5) ) (or [Al-(Co) over bar (12)]Co (Co) over bar (0.5) Al-0.5 ((W) over bar, (Ta) over bar)(2.0) = (Co) over bar Al-78.125(9.375) ((W) over bar, (Ta) over bar)(12.500) at.%). For example, alloy Co82Al9W9 and its gamma and gamma' phases are formulated respectively as [Al-Co-12] Co1.1Al0.4W1.4 (similar to[Al-Co-12]Co1.5Al0.5W1.0), [Al-Co-12]Co1.6Al0.4W1.0) (similar to[Al-Co-12]Co1.5Al0.5W1.0), and [Al-Co-12]Co0.3Al0.5W2.2) (similar to[Al-Co-12]Co0.5Al0.5W2.0).

   in high-refractory content Ni-based superalloys
SO SCRIPTA MATERIALIA
AB The effect of phosphorous on the microstructure of a powder-processed, high Nb-content, Ni-based superalloy was studied and compared to a P-free variant. The P-doped sample had a lower incipient melting temperature, forming a (Ni, Co, Cr, P)(2)(Nb, Mo) laves phase along the grain boundaries. Transmission electron microscopy and atom probe tomography were used to identify the crystal structure, assess phase compositions, and determine any elemental segregation to phase boundaries. The results revealed strong partitioning of P to the laves phase and a slight Mo gradient towards the phrase. Finally, a simplified laves phase was successfully modeled via density functional theory calculations. (C) 2018 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Surface/Interface Quality Diagnosis of Alloy Casting by Laser Induced
   Breakdown Spectroscopy
SO SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
AB The investment precision casting technology is widely adopted in manufacturing superalloy castings. Single crystal superalloy casting blades have high precision in dimension, without inner defects and surface defects. Knobs, pits and shrinkage cavity on surface of castings are caused by unsuitable temperature field, melted alloy flow field, and interface reaction of melted alloy with ceramic shell. The laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) is an efficient surface and interface analysis technique, with obvious advantage in diagnosis of casting surface/interface, with micro destruction, independent on surface planeness of sample. The parameters were optimized in depth analysis of single crystal superalloy by LIBS. A good spatial resolution has been obtained at 2 mm aperture, 500 mJ of output energy and off focus radiation with 1 064 nm pulse Gaussian laser beam; meanwhile spectrum signal distortion brought from ablation and excitation of surface by exceeding secondary diffraction ring with low laser energy density was reduced. Ablated volume per pulse was linear to output of laser energy with good correlation, positively correlated to the aperture diameter, independent on shot frequency. Depth analysis of surface and interface of single crystal superalloy blade was performed by LIBS. Alloy depletion of Al, Ti, Ni, Cr and Co in DD407 single crystal blade was observed with significant depletion of Al and Ti up to 50 mu m depth, using SiO2 -Al2O3 ceramic shell with mullite phase in cast process. The alloy depletion of edge of the blade was more outstanding than thick part. Precipitation of calcium salt, magnesium salt, sodium salt and carbon matters on blade surface occurs after dissolution to remove ceramic shell and ceramic core. Sodium salt has been removed completely after washed with boiling water and ultrasonic washing; most of calcium matters, magnesium matters and carbon matters have been removed and small amount remained in 3 similar to 5 mu m depth. LIBS is efficient in terms of composition-depth distribution analysis of alloy casting surface and interface, providing surface/interface quality criteria and presenting bright application prospect.

TI Investigation on the homogenization treatment and element segregation on
   the microstructure of a /-cobalt-based superalloy
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MINERALS METALLURGY AND MATERIALS
AB The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of element segregation on the microstructure and phase in a / cobalt- based superalloy. Several samples were prepared from a cast alloy and homogenized at 1300 degrees C for different times, with a maximum of 24 h. A microstructural study of the cast alloy using wavelength-dispersive spectroscopic analysis revealed that elements such as Al, Ti, and Ni segregated mostly within interdendritic regions, whereas W atoms were segregated within dendrite cores. With an increase in homogenization time, segregation decreased and the initial dendritic structure was eliminated. Field-emission scanning electron microscopy micrographs showed that the phases in the cores and interdendritic regions of the as-cast alloy were 392 and 124 nm, respectively. The size difference of was found to be due to the different segregation behaviors of constituent elements during solidification. After homogenization, particularly after 16 h, segregation decreased; thus, the size, chemical composition, and hardness of the precipitated phase was mostly uniform throughout the samples.

TI gamma '-(L1(2)) precipitate evolution during isothermal aging of a
   Co-Al-W-Ni superalloy
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB The coarsening kinetics and elemental partitioning behavior of gamma'-(L1(2)) precipitates in a gamma(f.c.c.)-matrix for a model quaternary Co-8.8Al-8.9W-9.9Ni at.% superalloy are investigated utilizing isothermal aging conditions at 650, 800 and 900 degrees C. The gamma'-precipitate mean radius, number density, and volume fraction, at 800 and 900 degrees C, were studied using scanning electron microscopy; the calculated temporal exponents associated with coarsening of gamma'-precipitates display good agreement with model predictions for quasi stationary coarsening. An atom probe tomographic (APT) investigation of the aged gamma/gamma' microstructure at 650 degrees C demonstrates that the compositions and volume fractions of both phases vary continuously up to 4096 h. The aged microstructure at 650 degrees C consists of interconnected nanoscale gamma'-precipitates, corroborated utilizing SEM for the 4096 h aged-specimen. The activation energy for coarsening is estimated for the temperature range 650-900 degrees C to be 283 kJ mol(-1), in reasonable agreement with activation energies for diffusion of Al, W, and Ni in Co, suggesting that coarsening of gamma'-precipitates is limited by bulk-diffusion. APT measurements of specimens aged for 1024 hat 800 and 900 degrees C demonstrate that the isothermal aging temperature has a significant effect on the compositions and partitioning behavior of Co, Al, W and Ni between the gamma- and gamma'-phases. The partitioning ratio of the concentrations between the gamma'- and gamma-phases is largest for W, decreasing linearly from 5.3 +/- 0.1 at 650 degrees C to 2.1 +/- 1.2 at 900 degrees C, and smallest for Co, decreasing from 0.86 +/- 0.01 at 650 degrees C to 0.73 +/- 0.01 at 900 degrees C.

SO SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY OF WELDING AND JOINING
AB In this study, tapered slots with an opening width about 200 mu m were artificially fabricated in IN738LC superalloy to imitate service cracks. The 'cracks' were repaired by diffusion brazing with a Ni-Cr-Co-Al-Ta-B filler alloy at 1150 degrees C and then heat treated at 1180 degrees C (HT-A) and 1190 degrees C (HT-B), respectively. A joint with uniform microstructure, chemical composition and hardness was obtained using HT-B. The mechanisms of the borides evolution during homogenisation were discussed. The tensile strength of the HT-B joint tested at 20, 600 and 800 degrees C reached up to approximately 96, 90 and 87% of the base metal, respectively. The fracture modes of the joints tensile tested at various temperatures were discussed.

This alloy is a part of new group of high-temperature materials based on Co solid solution and strengthened by coherent L1(2) phase similar to Ni-based superalloys with gamma' phase. The final form of Co-ss/L1(2) microstructure is obtained after fully heat treatment included homogenization, solutionizing and aging processes. But first step of heat treatment thermal parameters determination is characterization of primary microstructure of alloys after casting process with special attentions on segregations of alloying elements in solid solution and presences of structural elements such as eutectic areas, and other phases precipitations. In analysed case the relatively high homogeneity of chemical composition was expected especially in the case of W distribution, what was confirmed be SEM/EDS analysis in dendritic and interdendritic areas.

SO MATERIALI IN TEHNOLOGIJE
AB The isothermal oxidation behavior of a NiCrAlY coating prepared by means of electrospark deposition (ESD) technology on second-generation Ni-based single-crystal DD6 was investigated at 1100 degrees C for 100 h. Surface morphologies, chemical composition, and the phase constitution of the coating were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive spectrometer (EDS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The results showed that the as-deposited NiCrAlY coating, with uniform superfine columnar crystals and nanocrystallines. consists of beta-NiAl and gamma-Ni double phases; the oxidation resistance of the DD6 alloy was greatly improved by depositing the NiCrAlY coating, which was covered by two layers of oxides, theta-Al2O3 and alpha-Al2O3, while three layers of oxides, including Ni(Co)O, NiCr2O4, CrTaO4, CoTa2O6 and alpha-Al2O3, formed on the DD6 superalloy; the interdiffusion zone (IDZ) and secondary reaction zone (SRZ) formed between the NiCrAlY coating and the DD6 superalloy substrate for the interdiffusion; however, no deleterious Kirkendall voids appeared, which may be mainly due to the gradient transition of the elements between the coating and the substrate.

TI First Demonstration of Additive Manufacturing of Cutting Tools using
   Directed Energy Deposition System: Stellite (TM)-Based Cutting Tools
SO ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING
AB Machine-tool concepts are becoming increasingly complex to meet the demanding requirements of advanced applications. This raises per-tool costs for manufacturers and end users, motivating the development of novel, innovative fabrication methods for these tools. Our objective herein is to investigate laser-based additive manufacturing to fabricate application-optimized machine-tools that perform comparably to commercially-available products. To demonstrate this technology, multi-layer Stellite (TM) (Co-Cr-W superalloy) structures were deposited on a stainless-steel substrate via directed energy deposition technique to be used as a tool for cutting applications requiring high-temperature strength and ductility, an area where conventional carbide and high-speed steel tools are challenged. The as-printed structures were free of large-scale defects and voids, and were further characterized and compared to commercial Blackalloy 525 barstock (B525), a Co-Cr-W alloy tool of similar composition. The Stellite (TM) contained mostly Co-rich (alpha-phase) dendrites, as well as inter-dendritic Cr7C3 and Cr23C6 phases. The B525 composition consisted of a range of lamellar-eutectic microstructure comprised of Co-phase with W6C reinforcement. In reciprocating wear testing, Stellite (TM) 6 maintained a steady-state COF within 20% of B525 (0.36 +/- 0.01 vs. 0.30 +/- 0.01), and final wear rate as low as 38% difference from B525 (5.14*10(-6) +/- 4.58*10(-7) N/mm(3)vs. 3.20*10(-6) +/- 4.99*10(-7 )N/mm(3)). During a turning operation of SS304L, the mm mm Stellite (TM) 6 tool demonstrated consistent chip formation and more consistent rake-face and cratering wear in comparison to the B525 tool, indicating its adequacy for service in this application. Our results demonstrate for the first time that directed-energy-deposition can be utilized to fabricate advanced cutting tool concepts for job-specific applications.

TI Preparation of a Duplex Nanocrystalline Coating by Magnetron Sputtering
   and Its Oxidation Performance
SO JOURNAL OF NANOSCIENCE AND NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB A duplex nanocrystalline coating was prepared in this study by magnetron sputtering on N5 single-crystal super alloy (Ni: Bal, Co: 7.5, Cr: 7.0, Al: 6.2, Ta: 6.5, Re: 3.0, Mo: 1.5 and W: 5.0, wt%). The novel nanocrystalline coating consists of two layers, the inner layer having the same composition with the alloy substrate for avoiding elements inter diffusion while the outer layer has 7.6 wt% higher Al to quickly ensure the formation of a protective Al2O3 layer. Both two layers were deposited within one magnetron sputtering apparatus that contained two targets. The main target was having the same alloy substrate in composition and secondary target with pure Al. The difference in Al content between the two layers was achieved by controlling the secondary target during sputtering. This study revealed a way for preparing a series of similar coatings with varying compositions and improving performance. After oxidation at 1050 degrees C, a protective Al2O3 layer was quickly formed on the duplex nanocrystalline coating and no TCP phases were detected in the alloy substrate.

TI Effect of heat treatment and hot working on microstructure and
   mechanical properties of a novel nickel base superalloy
SO LETTERS ON MATERIALS
AB The microstructure and mechanical properties of a novel nickel base superalloy intended for manufacturing of die tools and parts for gas turbine engine have been investigated. The superalloy designated as SLZhS-1R had the following composition: Ni-47(Al, Cr, Co, Ta, W, Hf)-0.2(C, B) (wt. %). The as-cast superalloy was subjected to homogenization and heterogenization heat treatment, which is typically performed before hot working. However, the heat treatment led to appearance of platelike precipitates, which are not favorable for the hot workability. Therefore, the superalloy was subjected to hot working taking the as-cast condition as the initial one. To do it, unidirectional hot forging at a temperature slightly below the.' solvus temperature with a strain rate of epsilon' similar to 10(-2) s(-1) was carried out. The as-cast superalloy showed reasonable workability that allowed producing sound forgings. The forging procedure provided formation of mixed microstructure consisted of coarse non-recrystallized and fine recrystallized. grains. EBSD analysis of the forged workpiece showed that the fraction of highangle grain boundaries was insignificant. The hot forging resulted in dynamic recovery, whereas recrystallization processes occurred only locally near the. grain boundaries. Tensile tests were carried out for the heat treated and hot forged conditions as well as for the as-cast condition. The heat treated and especially the forged and heat treated condition showed appreciably higher strength and ductility as compared to those of the

TI Effect of Ta and Ti on the solidification characteristics of novel
   gamma'-strengthened Co-base superalloys
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB The effects of Ta and Ti on the microstructure, segregation and solidification path of Co-7A1-8W-base alloy were investigated using directional solidification quenching experiments and isothermal solidification quenching experiments. The results showed that the as-cast microstructure of the Co-7Al-8W alloy (Base alloy) is the gamma single phase. The Al element slightly segregates to the interdendritic regions, the W element slightly segregates to the dendritic core, and Co has almost no segregation. The solidification path of the Co-7Al-8W-4Ti alloy is L -> L-1+gamma -> L-2+gamma+(beta+gamma')(e) -> L-3+gamma+(beta+gamma')(e)+gamma'->gamma+(beta+gamma')(e)+gamma', After the addition of 1 at.% Ti, there is no change in the segregation of elements, the microstructure and the solidification path of the alloy. The Ta element strongly segregates to the interdendritic regions in the Co-7Al-8W-1Ta alloy. With the addition of 4 at.% Ti, the Ti element strongly segregates to the interdendritic regions, and the segregation of Al and W elements increases. Blocky gamma' phase and (beta+y')(e) eutectics form in the interdendritic regions. The solidification path of the Co-7Al-8W-4Ti alloy is L -> L-1+gamma -> L-2+gamma+(beta+Y')(e) -> L-3+gamma+(beta+gamma')(e)+gamma' ->gamma+(beta+gamma')(e)+y', After the addition of 1 at.% Ta+4 at.% Ti, the segregation of Al, Ta and Ti decreases, while the segregation of W increases. Laves phase, blocky gamma' phase and ((beta+y')e eutectics form in the interdendritic regions. The solidification path of the Co-7A1-8W-1Ta-4Ti alloy is L -> L-1+gamma -> L-2+gamma+Laves -> L-3+gamma+Laves+(beta+gamma')(e) -> L-4+gamma+Laves+(beta+gamma')(e)+gamma' -> gamma+Laves+(beta+gamma')(e)+gamma'. The above results could provide an experimental basis for composition optimization and solidification process control of novel gamma'-strengthened Co-base superalloys. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

TI Combinatorial Study on Phase Formation and Oxidation in the Thin Film
   Superalloy Subsystems Co-Al-Cr and Co-Al-Cr-W
SO ACS COMBINATORIAL SCIENCE
AB Two Co-based superalloy subsystems, the ternary system Co-Al-Cr and the quasi-ternary system Co-Al-Cr-W with a constant amount of 10 at. % W, were deposited as thin-film materials libraries and analyzed in terms of phase formation and oxidation behavior at 500 degrees C in air. By combining energy-dispersive X-ray analysis and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy high-throughput composition measurements, a detailed evaluation of the dependence between the initial multinary metal composition and the oxide scale composition which is forming upon oxidation on the surface of the thin film is established. Phase maps for both materials libraries are provided by high-throughput X-ray diffraction. In addition, the oxidation of a Co-Al-Cr-W bulk sample was analyzed and compared to a corresponding film in the library.

TI Effect of microstructure on early oxidation of MCrAlY coatings
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB Two MCrAlY coatings with the same nominal composition, but different microstructures are deposited onto Hastelloy (R) X superalloy substrates by low-pressure plasma spraying (LPPS) and high velocity oxygen fuel (HVOF) spraying, respectively. The early oxidation behaviour of the coatings at 1150 degrees C is studied. For the LPPS coating with relative coarse grains, the gamma and beta-phase show different oxidation behaviours: the oxide on the gamma-phase shows a multi-layer structure, consisting of outer (Ni,Co) (Cr,Al)(2)O-4, intermediate (Cr,Al)(2)O-3 and inner alpha-Al2O3; the oxidation of the beta-phase, however, is characterised by selective oxidation of aluminium and the oxide is composed of a mixture of theta and alpha-Al2O3. a For the nanocrystalline HVOF coating, it does not show site-specific oxidation and the oxidation is characterised by formation of an exclusive alpha-Al2O3 scale over the surface. The microstructure-dependent oxidation is quantitatively described from the perspective of oxidation kinetics, with contribution from both lattice and grain boundary diffusion taken into consideration. A critical grain size of the gamma-phase, below which formation of an exclusive Al2O3 scale can be achieved, is predicted and verified. The study gives new insights into oxidation of MCrAlY coatings.

TI Temporal evolution of a model Co-Al-W superalloy aged at 650 degrees C
   and 750 degrees C
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB The temporal evolution of a gamma(f.c.c.)/gamma' (L1(2)) Co-8.8Al-73 W superalloy aged at 650 degrees C (10 min-4096 h) and 750 degrees C (10 min-256 h) is studied utilizing atom-probe tomography (APT), scanning electron microscopy, and Vickers microhardness testing. The evolution of the phase compositions, gamma' (L1(2)) volume fraction, and mean precipitate radius, <R2-D(t)>, are determined. Coarsening rate constants and temporal exponents are calculated for <R-D(t)> of the gamma' (L1(2))-nanoprecipitates. The temporal exponents are found to be generally close to 1/p = 1/3 as required for diffusion-limited coarsening. Tungsten solid-solubility is significantly reduced in the gamma(f.c.c.)-matrix at 650 degrees C (0.54 +/- 0.04 at. %) and 750 degrees C (1.35 +/- 0.06 at. %) when compared with aging at 900 degrees C (5.5 at. %). The value of <R-2D(t)> of the gamma' (L1(2))-nanoprecipitates increases with increasing aging time corresponding to an increase in the Vickers microhardness; the peak strength was not, however, achieved for the aging times investigated. The morphology of the gamma' (L1(2))-nanoprecipitates begins as spheroids but transitions to cuboids at longer aging times, with final the gamma' (L1(2)) volume fractions for aging at 650 degrees C and 750 degrees C being phi = 53% and 54%, respectively. The effect of quench-rate (either furnace-cooled, air-cooled, oil quenched, or water quenched) from a supersolvus temperature of 1050 degrees C on the microstructure of the alloy is also investigated. Slow cooling (furnace and air-cooling) is shown to result in a uniform distribution of nanometer sized gamma' (L1(2))-nanoprecipitates, unlike Ni-based superalloys in which the gamma' (L1(2))-nanoprecipitates form in a non-uniform or multimodal distribution.

TI Fabrication of Narrow-Fraction Micropowders of NiAl-Based Refractory
   Alloy CompoNiAl-M5-3
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SELF-PROPAGATING HIGH-TEMPERATURE SYNTHESIS
AB Powders of new CompoNiAl M5-3 heat-resistant alloy were prepared by mechanoactivated SHS from (Ni-Al-Cr-Co-Hf)-NaCl mixtures. Ni dissolution in Al melt was found to be the motive force of combustion. Unlike the binary Ni-Al system, NiAl is formed not in the melt but in the post-combustion zone as a result of diffusion-controlled processes. Conditions for MASHS were optimized toward fabrication of a superalloy with homogeneous composition/structure and low content of gas impurities. As-prepared combustion product was disintegrated into a powder and the latter was subjected to plasma spheroidization, keeping in mind the needs of additive manufacturing. The attained degree of spheroidization was 98%. The structure and phase/chemical compositions of spherical powders did not differ from those of the synthesized powders. After plasma treatment, the content of gas impurities (?(2) and N-2) decreased.

TI Homogenization heat treatment and segregation analysis of equiaxed
   CMSX-4 superalloy for gas turbine components
SO JOURNAL OF THERMAL ANALYSIS AND CALORIMETRY
AB Homogenization heat treatment and segregation analysis of equiaxed CMSX-4 nickel-based superalloy were investigated. The researches were focused on studying the influence of a multi-cycle heat treatment on the evolution of CMSX-4 superalloy in terms of microstructure and porosity. The heat treatment temperature was selected based on the chemical composition of superalloy and thermodynamic calculations of solidification path and phase formation using a thermodynamic software. Elemental partition coefficients were calculated using the local chemical compositions in different areas of the samples, before and after each heat treatment cycle. It was observed that Al, Ti and Ta segregate in the interdendritic regions and eutectic gamma-gamma' pools, while W, Re and Co segregate mainly in the dendrite cores and the dendrite arms. The compositional analysis shows an increase in the structure homogeneity after the heat treatment, but a certain compositional gradient between the dendrite cores and the interdendritic regions is still observed. The qualitative analysis based on the backscattered electron images sustains the results obtained from the compositional analysis regarding the homogenization of the alloy. A descending evolution of the cuboidal gamma' phase was observed until 6 h of holding, but after 9 h of holding at 1573 K the size of cuboidal gamma' phase starts to grow especially in the interdendritic regions. After long temperature holding time, a notable increase in porosity level was observed due to the partition coefficients of the alloying elements and dissolution of the residual phases (eutectic gamma-gamma' pools, coarse gamma').

TI Cyclic Oxidation and Hot Corrosion Behavior of Plasma-Sprayed CoCrAlY
   plus WC-Co Coating on Turbine Alloys
SO JOURNAL OF FAILURE ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION
AB Components in energy-producing systems suffer a variety of degradation processes such as oxidation and molten salt-induced corrosion as a consequence of complex multi-component gaseous environment. Coatings provide a composition that will grow the protective scale at high temperatures having long-term stability. Plasma spraying was used to deposit CoCrAlY + WC-Co composite coatings on turbine alloys of Hastelloy X and AISI 321. The thermocyclic oxidation behavior of coated alloys was investigated in static air and in molten salt (Na2SO4-60%V2O5) environment at 700 degrees C. The thermogravimetric technique was used to approximate the kinetics of oxidation in 50 cycles, each cycle consisting of heating and cooling. X-ray diffraction and SEM/EDAX techniques are used to characterize the oxide scale formed. Coated alloys showed a lower corrosion rate as compared to uncoated alloys. The coatings subjected to oxidation and hot corrosion showed slow scale growth kinetics. Preferential oxidation of Co, Cr, W and its spinel blocks the transport of oxygen and corrosive species into the coating by providing a barrier, thereby making the oxidation rate to reach steady state. As compared to the substrate alloys, coatings show better hot corrosion resistance.

TI On the diffusive phase transformation mechanism assisted by extended
   dislocations during creep of a single crystal CoNi-based superalloy
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB We propose here a deformation-induced diffusive phase transformation mechanism occurring during shearing of gamma' ordered phase in a gamma/gamma' single crystalline CoNi-based superalloy. Shearing involved the creation and motion of a high density of planar imperfections. Through correlative electron microscopy and atom probe tomography, we captured a superlattice intrinsic stacking fault (SISF) and its associated moving leading partial dislocation (LPD). The structure and composition of these imperfections reveal characteristic chemical structural contrast. The SISF locally exhibits a D0(19) ordered structure coherently embedded in the L-12 gamma' and enriched in W and Co. Interestingly, the LPD is enriched with Cr and Co, while the adjoining planes ahead of the LPD are enriched with Al. Quantitative analysis of the three-dimensional compositional field in the vicinity of imperfections sheds light onto a new in-plane diffusion mechanism as the LPD moves on specific {111)}evier planes upon application of stress at high temperature.

SO JOM
AB The effect of two base alloys, viz. Ni-based superalloy Rene 80 and Co-based alloy ECY768, on the oxidation and interdiffusion behavior of a NiCoCrAlY Re-containing coating after exposure for up to 2000 h at 1050A degrees C in synthetic air has been evaluated. Scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy was employed to measure the element concentrations, and phases were identified by electron backscatter diffraction. Significant depletion of beta-NiAl within the coating, enrichment of gamma'-phase, and formation of A mu-phase in the alloy and Kirkendall porosity at the coating-alloy interface were observed in the coating on Rene 80. In contrast, the coating on the Co-base alloy ECY768 formed large amounts of Cr/Re-rich carbides and the depletion of beta-NiAl phase was less pronounced than that observed on the Ni-base alloy. These findings could be interpreted using an in-house-developed thermodynamic-kinetic CALPHAD-based computer model.

   MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Cobalt-based superalloy matrix composite materials were produced through the powder metallurgy technique using element powders at high purity and nano-sized wolfram carbide (WC) reinforcement in this study. An alloy that had the same chemical composition as the Stellite 6 alloy but not containing carbon was selected as the matrix alloy. The powder mixtures obtained as a result of mixing WC reinforcing member and element powders at the determined ratio were shaped by applying 300 MPa of pressure. The green components were sintered under argon atmosphere at 1240 A degrees C for 120 minutes. The densities of the sintered components were determined by the Archimedes' principle. Microstructural characterization was performed via X-ray diffraction analysis, scanning electron microscope examinations, and energy-dispersive spectrometry. Hardness measurements and tensile tests were performed for determining mechanical characteristics. The relative density values of the sintered components increased by increasing the WC reinforcement ratio and they could almost reach the theoretical density. It was determined from the microstructural examinations that the composite materials consisted of fine and equiaxed grains and coarse carbides demonstrating a homogeneous dispersion along the microstructure at the grain boundaries. As it was the case in the density values, the hardness and strength values of the composites increased by increasing the WC ratio.

   systems
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB The Co-Ta-V and Co-Nb-V ternary systems are investigated in a search for L1(2)-ordered gamma' precipitation, based on recent computational predictions of stable gamma+gamma' microstructures. Four alloys with nominal (at. %) composition Co-6Ta-6V, Co-5.4Ta-6.6V-xNi (x = 0 and 10), and Co-6Nb-6V are arc-melted, homogenized at 1250 degrees C, and aged at 900 degrees C for 2,16 and 64 h. Nanometric, cuboidal gamma' precipitates within a fcc-gamma matrix are discovered in the Co-Ta-V system after aging for 2 h, and in the Co-Nb-V system after cooling from homogenization. The compositions of these two new gamma'-phases, as measured via atom probe tomography, are Co-3(Ta0.76V0.24) and Co-3(Nb0.65V0.35), respectively. Upon aging at 900 degrees C, the gamma' precipitates coarsen, dissolve and transform to lamellar C36-Co-3(Ta,V) and needle-shape DO19-CO3(Nb,V), measured as Co-3(Nb0.81V0.19) by APT, respectively. This shows that these ternary gamma' phases are metastable and points to the need for their stabilization via additional alloying elements. (C) 2018 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The results demonstrate the substantial impact of the two-phase microstructure on the initiation of oxidation for the appearance of the scale. Examination of STEM-EDX elemental mappings of the internal oxidation front during the early stages of scale growth can explain the origin of isolated Al2O3 precipitates instead of a closed protective layer.

TI Influences of Cr and Co on the Growth of Thermally Grown Oxide in
   Thermal Barrier Coating during High-Temperature Exposure
SO COATINGS
AB Thermal barrier coating (TBC) is a critical material in the aerospace domain to increase the lifetime of gas turbine components subjected to thermal load. The properties of TBC are strongly related to the growth of thermally grown oxide (TGO) whose main constituent is Al2O3. However, the oxidation of Cr and Co can affect the growth of TGO, which is not studied sufficiently. In this paper, high-temperature exposure at 1000 degrees C was performed to investigate the effect of Cr and Co oxides on TGO growth. The morphology and composition analysis of the interface between the ceramic top coat and the bond coat (TC/BC) were investigated by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and the energy dispersion spectrum (EDS). The thermodynamics and kinetics of oxidation were analyzed. The results indicated that the oxidation kinetics basically followed the sub-parabolic law with exposure time. Additionally, the major factor affecting the formation of oxides was the diffusion rate at the initial stage of exposure, then oxides depended on thermodynamics, and the oxidation was influenced by both of them in the last stage. The major elements to be oxidized were different at different stages. Moreover, the replacement reaction of Cr2O3 and the phase conversion of Al2O3 resulted in thickness variations of the TGO and Al-depleted zone during high-temperature exposure.

TI Multicomponent gamma'-strengthened Co-based superalloys with increased
   solvus temperatures and reduced mass densities
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB Several Co-Al-(W)-based gamma-(FCC)/gamma'-(L1(2)) alloys are investigated to combine recent results indicating significant increases in the gamma'-solvus temperature with additions of Ni, Ta, and Ti, and reduced mass density with the substitution of Mo and Nb for W. A maximum solvus temperature of 1167 +/- 6 degrees C is achieved for an alloy with the composition Co-30Ni-7Al-4Ti-7W-1Ta (mole fraction x 100); while the composition Co-30Ni-7Al-4Ti-3Mo-2W-1Nb-1Ta (L19) exhibits a promising combination of high gamma' volume fraction and solvus temperature, low mass density, and excellent two-phase gamma-gamma'microstructural stability. Atom probe tomographic measurement of L19 aged for 4 hat 900 degrees C indicates that Ni, Al, Ti, W, Nb, and Ta partition preferentially to the gamma'-precipitates while Co partitions strongly to the gamma-matrix. Molybdenum segregates at the gamma/gamma' interface, resulting in a reduction in the interfacial free energy of 1.63 +/- 0.85 mJ m(-2). Decreasing the mole fraction of Ni from 30% to 10% decreases the partitioning of Al and Ti to the gamma'-phase and increases partitioning of Co, Mo, W, Nb, and Ta to the gamma'-phase. From an analysis of coarsening kinetics (Ostwald ripening) at 900 C in Co-xNi-7Al-4Ti-3Mo-2W-1Nb-1Ta (x = 10 and 30) interfacial free energies of 35.0 +/- 18.6 mJ m(-2) and 29.2 +/- 15.5 mJ m(-2) are calculated for mole fractions of Ni of 10% and 30%, respectively. This decrease in interfacial free energy with increasing Ni-concentration is attributed partially to both Mo-segregation at the gamma-gamma' interface and a decrease in the lattice parameter misfit between the gamma'-precipitate and gamma-matrix, and concomitantly the misfit strain energy.

TI Nickel-Based Single-Crystal Superalloys (Ni, Co)-Al-(Ta, Ti)-(Cr, Mo, W)
   Designed by Cluster-Plus-Glue-Atom Model and Their 1000 h Long-Term
   Ageing Behavior at 900 degrees C
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB It has been pointed out recently that the compositions of industrial alloys are originated from cluster-plus-glue-atom structure units in solid solutions. Specifically for nickel-based superalloys, after properly grouping the alloying elements into Al, Ni-like ((Ni) over bar, including Ni, Co, Fe, Re, Ru and Ir), gamma '- forming Cr-like ((Cr) over bar (gamma '), including Ta, Ti, V, Nb), and gamma-forming Cr-like ((Cr) over bar;(gamma), including Cr, Mo and W), the optimal formula for single-crystal superalloys has been established [Al-(Ni) over bar (12)] (Al-1(Cr) over bar (gamma ')(0.5)(Cr) over bar (gamma)(1.5)). In this work, the first generation single-crystal superalloys were investigated on the basis of the proposed formula, by using (Ni) over bar=(Ni and Co), (Cr) over bar (gamma ')=(Ta and Ti), and (Cr) over bar (gamma)=(Cr, Mo and W). Two series of alloys were designed, formulated respectively as group A: [Al-Ni11Co1] (Al1TaxTi0.5-xCr1W0.25Mo0.25), with x=0, 0.25 and 0.5 (the corresponding mass fractions of Ta and Ti are respectively 0Ta-2.65Ti, 4.82Ta-1.26Ti and 9,32Ta-0Ti), and group B: [Al-Ni12-yCo gamma](Al1Ta0.25Ti0.25Cr1W0.25MO0.25), with y=1.5, 1.75, 2 and 2.5 (the corresponding mass fractions of Co are respectively 9.43Co, 11Co, 12.57Co and 15.71Co). The single-crystal superalloys were prepared using selector technique. And then they underwent the following tests of incipient melting, standard heat treatment and 1000 h long term ageing at 900 degrees C. It is found that: (1) In group A, with increasing Ta content (decreasing Ti), all the incipient melting temperatures are increased to above 1330 degrees C, and to the highest value is between 1335 degrees C and 1340 degrees C for alloy 9.32Ta-0Ti; the gamma(')gamma(') lattice negative misfits after standard heat treatment are reduced from -0.262% (0Ta-2.65Ti) to -0.247% (9.32Ta-0Ti); the gamma(') coarsening tendency after long-term ageing is deduced, and alloy 9.32Ta-0Ti has the lowest coarsening rate (K=5.6x10(-5) mu(3)/h). (2) In group B, the Co content does not influence the incipient melting temperature (always above 1330 degrees C) and the coarsening rate of gamma(') after long-term ageing. The major role of Co is to increase the mean size of the gamma(') precipitates to about 0.55 pm and the gamma(') volume fraction to about 69% after the standard heat treatment. These two groups of alloys have their gamma(') coarsening rates approaching the level of third-generation single-crystal superalloys (K approximate to(2.08 similar to 3.82)*10(-5) mu m(3)/h).

TI Mechanical and microstructural characterization of MCrAlY coatings
   produced by laser cladding: The influence of the Ni, Co and Al content
SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB Laser metal deposition (LMD) and laser cladding (LC) are alternative methods to thermal spraying processes to produce dense, high-quality coatings. In this work, two MCrAlY coatings (M = Ni + Co) have been prepared onto stainless steel substrate using a coaxial LC technique under two different Ni/Co and Al proportions. The mechanical properties were then evaluated with microhardness, nanoindentation, and three-point bending tests. The microstructure and composition of coatings were characterized by X-ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis and Field Emission Electron Microscopy (FESEM) coupled to an Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) detector. The study revealed that the gamma/beta phases formed in the MCrAIY coating microstructure result in a lower elastic modulus than the austenitic stainless steel substrate, while an inverse behavior for hardness was observed due the presence of the aluminum-rich beta-phase. Under flexural loads, the failure of coatings showed plasticity and anisotropy characteristics depending on the two laser tracks orientations evaluated.

TI Microstructure prediction of TMW-4M3 during heat treatment
SO COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB The calculation model on the basis of multi-phase-field model, coupled with the calculation of phase diagram (CALPHAD) approach and classical nucleation theory (CNT) model, was studied for the precipitation behavior of gamma' precipitates in Ni-Co base superalloy TMW-4M3 ("TMW" is a trademark of National Institute for Materials Science registered in Japan) during the heat treatment process. This alloy is precipitation strengthened by gamma', and thus the control of size and distribution of gamma' precipitates is very important for practical applications. Precipitation behavior of gamma' in TMW-4M3 is strongly influenced by heat treatment conditions. Therefore, numerical simulation is useful for finding the most appropriate manufacturing condition prior to experimental trial and error approach. Firstly, we investigated the gamma' solvus temperature and improved several thermodynamic parameters of the conventional database to obtain reasonable phase boundaries between gamma/eta (Ni3Ti) and gamma/gamma'. Based on the new thermodynamic description, the nucleation rates related to temperature histories were calculated by using the CNT with composition balance equation under subsolvus solution treatment. Finally, the multi-phase-field method coupled with the CALPHAD approach and CNT model was applied to the microstructure evolution of intragranular secondary gamma' particles. The experimental and simulated microstructures show good agreement with each other. This method might be useful for microstructure evolution prediction of gamma/gamma' dual phase during the heat-treatment. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Kinetics pathway of precipitation in model Co-Al-W superalloy
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB The early stages of precipitation of the gamma' phase in a model Co based superalloy (Co-9.1Al-7W (at.%)) have been investigated at 900 degrees C using electron microscopy and atom probe tomography. Nucleation, growth and coarsening stages have been studied with a focus on the temporal evolution of the precipitate composition in the light of recent theoretical developments on phase separation in multicomponent alloys. The experimental data have been confronted to the theories of nucleation and coarsening recently developed for such alloys, which are valid for non-ideal and non-dilute systems, and predict the temporal evolution of both the matrix and precipitate compositions. The rate constant for the mean size evolution of the particles, as derived from experiments, has been compared to the one predicted by the mentioned coarsening theory that accounts for a more accurate description of the thermodynamics of the phases, as compared with more classical approaches. From this comparison the gamma/gamma' interfacial energy was derived and found equal to similar to 48 mJ/m(2) The exponents for the temporal evolution of average particles size, number of particles per unit volume were found identical to those for binary alloys during the coarsening regime, as expected, and the temporal evolutions of compositions in both gamma and gamma' phases were found to evolve as predicted by theory. Indeed, the W content in the particles, measured from atom probe tomography (APT) experiments, was found to significantly decrease with time and the observed evolution is remarkably well described by the theory and therefore is shown to originate from the competition between diffusion and capillarity.

TI Microstructure and lifetime of Hf or Zr doped sputtered NiAlCr bond
   coat/7YSZ EB-PVD TBC systems
SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB NiAlCr-X overlay coatings deposited by magnetron sputtering on IN100 and CMSX-4 superalloys and thereafter top-coated with 7YSZ thermal barrier coatings by EB-PVD were investigated with emphasis on the effects of superalloy type and Hf or Zr doping. The sputtered films in the "as coated" condition (after EB-PVD deposition) showed strong diffusion effects of different elements from the superalloys. The measured phase content of beta and gamma' was in good agreement with calculated data obtained from experimental compositions normalized to a Ni-Al-Cr system following the guidelines of site preference of ternary alloying elements. Microstructure evolution and failure characteristics after furnace cyclic tests at 1100 degrees C were investigated as well. The lifetime of the coatings is equivalent to standard MCrAlY TBCs systems and is compared to PtAl and NiCoCrAlY coatings from literature. The effects of microstructure and elements diffusing from the substrates into the bond coat (Ti, Co, Mo and Ta) in combination with the effect of Hf- or Zr-doping is presented and discussed.

   Superalloys Ni-Co-Cr-Mo-W-Al-Ti-Ta with Varying Co Contents
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA-ENGLISH LETTERS
AB It has been recently pointed out that the compositions of industrial alloys are originated from cluster-plus-glueatom structure units in solid solutions. Specifically for Ni-based superalloys, after properly grouping the alloying elements into Al, Ni-like ((Ni) over bar), gamma'-forming Cr-like ((Cr) over tilde (gamma')) and gamma-forming Cr-like ((Cr) over bar (gamma)), the optimal formula for single-crystal superalloys is established [ Al-(Ni) over bar (12)](Al-1(Cr) over bar (gamma')(0.5) (Cr) over bar (gamma)(1.5)). The Co substitutions for Ni at the shell sites are conducted on the basis of the first-generation single-crystal superalloy AM3, formulated as [Al-Ni12-xCox](Al1Ti0.25Ta0.25Cr1W0.25Mo0.25), with x = 1.5, 1.75, 2 and 2.5 (the corresponding weight percents of Co are 9.43, 11.0, 12.57 and 15.71, respectively). The 900 degrees C long-term aging follows the Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner theory (LSW theory), and the Co content does not have noticeable influence on the coarsening rate of gamma'. The microstructure and creep behavior of the four (001) single-crystal alloys are investigated. The creep rupture lifetime is reduced as Co increases. The alloy with the lowest Co (9.43 Co) shows the longest lifetime of about 350 h at 1050 degrees C/120 MPa, and all the samples show N-type rafting after creep tests.

AB In this study, the microstructure of the bond coat of the YSZ/NiCrAlCo-Y2O3 systems after isothermal oxidation was examined. The ceramic top coating (YSZ) and bond coat (NiCrAlCo-Y2O3) were manufactured by atmospheric plasma spraying (APS) process and were sprayed onto Inconel 718 superalloy. The thickness of the NiCrAlCo-Y2O3 bond coat was 140 +/- 10 mu m. Isothermal oxidation tests were performed at 1050 degrees C during 100 and 200 h in static air. The thermally grown oxide (TGO) layer was formed at the interface between the top coat and the bond coat as a consequence of the isothermal oxidation tests. Cross-section samples after isothermal oxidation were evaluated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The analysis of EDS was performed to the TGO and the lamellas of bond coat near to the TGO. The results showed that the TGO layer was composed mainly of chromium and oxygen as resulting from its diffusion and oxidation. The analysis of the lamellas near to the TGO showed elements such as Ni, Cr, and Co, which are related to the chemical composition of the bond coat. Additionally, Inconel 718 alloys constituents such as Fe and Nb were found in the same area as the result of the diffusion of these elements through the bond coat.

AB NiCr19Co6W10Ti3AlB alloy is a kind of precipitation hardening nickel-base superalloy, also is a kind of high temperature and high elasticity alloy. The chemical elements of the alloy composition is very complex, it includes more than 4.5% aging strengthening elements of Al and Ti, and nearly 37% solid solution strengthening elements of Cr, W, Co etc. Because of composition segregation in the alloy ingot, the difficulty of hot working is faced. In this paper, the composition segregation and homogenization annealing process of cast NiCr19Co6W10Ti3AlB alloy were studied. The dendrite segregation and its elimination method were investigated by homogenization annealing experiment. High temperature plastic deformation behavior of NiCr19Co6W10Ti3AlB alloy was also studied in this paper. By thermal simulation compression test, the thermal deformation behavior and microstructure change under different deformation conditions were analyzed, which provides a good reference for practical production.

AB Ni-based superalloy is widely used for high performance components in power generation turbine due to its excellent mechanical properties. However, Ni-based superalloy has low oxidation resistantance. Therefore, surface coating is required to improve oxidation resistance at high temperatures. Al-Si as a coting material was successfully co-deposited on Nibased substrate by pack cementation method at 900 degrees C for about 4 hours. The oxidation test was carried out at high temperature of 1000 degrees C for 100 hours. Micro structural characterization and analysis on crystal orientation were perfomed by using Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FE-SEM) and Electron Back Scatter Diffraction (EBSD) technique, respectively. The results showed that the coating layer with a homogenous layer and had a thickness of 53 mu m consisting of beta-NiAl with cubic structure and Ni2Al3 with hexagonal structure. TGO layer was developed after oxidation and had a thickness of about 5 mu m consisting of alpha-Al2O3 and spinel NiCr2O4. The phase composition map and crystal orientation acquired by EBSD technique was also discussed both in TGO and coating layers.

SO CORROSION ENGINEERING SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The oxidation tests of the Nimonic 263 alloy exposed to deaerated supercritical water at 600-700 degrees C under 25 MPa were carried out for up to 1000 h. Oxidation rate increased with an increase in temperature. The microstructure and phase composition of oxide scale were analysed by scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. It can be seen that a complex oxide structure formed on the surface of Nimonic 263 including an outer layer of Ni-Fe/Ni-Cr spinel oxide, Ni/Co hydroxide and TiO2 and an inner layer of a mixture of NiCr2O4 and Cr2O3 while the innermost layer is made up of Cr2O3. The MoO3 can be observed at 600 degrees C but disappeared with the increasing temperature. The growth mechanism of oxide scale was discussed.

AB In this paper, we will study the co-precipitation kinetics of phases in Superalloy 718 using the simulation tool we have developed using the CALPHAD approach. This tool considers concurrent nucleation, growth and coarsening of these precipitates. Furthermore, it is directly integrated with thermodynamic calculation engine to obtain instant update of phase information, such as the composition of the matrix and the nucleation driving force for each precipitate. In addition to the average particle size, the more advanced KWN (Kampmann and Wagner Numerical) model was implemented to allow for predication of the full evolution of the particle size distribution (PSD). In this paper, we will perform virtual experiments using this tool to simulate the co-precipitation of the gamma ' and gamma '' phases under different heat treatment conditions. Simulation results, such as temporal evolution of volume fraction, number density, and mean size of the precipitates, as well as the final particle size distribution will be presented and discussed. The impact of delta precipitate and the initial microstructure will also be briefly discussed. These virtual experimental results can be used to understand the microstructural features of Superalloy 718 and serve as guidance for further optimization of heat treatment schedule.

AB VDM Alloy 780 Premium is a new 718-type superalloy recently developed in a cooperation between Technical University Braunschweig and VDM Metals GmbH [1, 2]. It contains the gamma'-phase for strengthening in addition to a second phase, in the following referred to as delta-phase (Note that determination of the crystal structure is pending. It may not have the same DOa structure as the delta-phase in Alloy 718.). As in Alloy 718, the delta-phase may be used for grain refinement and strengthening of grain boundaries at elevated temperatures. Most important differences in chemical composition compared to Alloy 718 are the essential replacement of Fe by about 25% Co and a higher Al-content (about 2%) in combination with a lower Ti-content (about 0.2%). Firstly, these measures stabilize the strengthening phase and allow for application temperatures of up to 750 degrees C. Secondly, the delta-phase is preserved despite the relatively high aluminum content. To make best use of Alloy 780, the precipitation kinetics of both phases along with the concurrent evolution of microstructure and mechanical properties must be understood. Consequently, this article deals with the influence of heat treatments on the phase kinetics, microstructure evolution and mechanical properties. Firstly, it will be demonstrated that proper control of the heat treatment parameters allows for a distribution of the delta-phase as in Alloy 718. Secondly, Vickers hardness testing along with creep rupture experiments will be presented, revealing interdependencies between heat treatment strategies and mechanical properties. At ambient temperature, the strength of the new alloy meets or exceeds that of Alloy 718 despite absence of the gamma ''-phase, while its creep strength is far superior.

TI Elemental preference and atomic scale site recognition in a Co-Al-W-base
   superalloy
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Using state-of-the-art atomic scale super energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and high angle annular dark field imaging this study reveals the elemental partitioning preference between the gamma' and gamma phases in a Co-Al-W-Ti-Ta superalloy and the site preference of its alloying elements in the ordered L1(2) gamma' phase. A semi-quantitative analysis of atomic column compositions in the ordered L1(2) gamma' structure is provided. Co atoms were found to occupy the {1/2, 1/2, 0} face-center positions whereas Al, W, Ti and Ta atoms prefer to occupy the {0, 0, 0} cube corner positions in the L1(2) gamma phase. These findings agree well with predictions from first principles simulations in the literature.

TI Synthesis and characterization of superalloy coatings by cathodic arc
   evaporation
SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB Superalloy targets were produced from Ni-(Al-C-Co-Cr-Mo-Ta-Ti-W) powders by spark plasma sintering technology. The crystalline structure of the as-produced targets was investigated by XRD analysis and compared with the evolution of phases resulting from the operation of the cathodic arc at the target (cathode) surface. Coatings were synthesized at superalloy substrates utilizing these superalloy targets in non-reactive and reactive evaporation processes. Synthesized coatings and target surfaces were compared with respect to chemical composition and crystal structure. The interface between coating and superalloy substrates was investigated by TEM. As an example, a complete layer stack was synthesized by cathodic arc evaporation starting from the super alloy substrate - superalloy coating interface to a fully oxidized superalloy coating showing epitaxial growth in the interface to the superalloy substrate.

TI Effects of Precipitant and pH on Coprecipitation of Nanosized Co-Cr-V
   Alloy Powders
SO MATERIALS
AB Nanosized Co-Cr-V alloy powders were synthesized via coprecipitation method. Effects of precipitants ((NH4)(2)C2O4<bold>H</bold>2O and Na2CO3) and pH were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Zeta potential analyzer, thermogravimetry-differential scanning calorimetry (TG-DSC), inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Co-Cr-V alloy powders were consisted of major face-centered cubic Co (fcc Co) and minor hexagonal close-packed Co (hcp Co). Grain sizes of precursors and Co-Cr-V alloy powders were increased with pH value (7-10) within the ranges of 3 similar to 39 and 39 similar to 66 nm, respectively. Rod-like or granular Co-Cr-V alloy particles were assembled by interconnected nanograins. At pH = 7, Na2CO3 precipitant was found to be beneficial to maintain the desirable composition of Co-Cr-V powders. It was also found that lower pH favors the maintenance of pre-designed composition, while grain coarsens at higher pH. Effects of variation for precipitant and pH on the morphology and composition of Co-Cr-V alloy powder were discussed in detail and relevant mechanism was further proposed.

TI Effects of titanium substitutions for aluminum and tungsten in
   Co-10Ni-9Al-9W (at%) superalloys
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB Polycrystalline Co-10Ni-(9 - x)Al-(9 - x)W-2xTi at% (x = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4) alloys with gamma(f.c.c.) plus gamma'(L1(2)) microstructures are investigated, where the gamma'(L1(2))-formers Al and W are replaced with Ti. Upon aging, the initially cuboidal gamma'(L1(2))-precipitates grow and develop a rounded morphology. After 256 h of aging at 1000 degrees C, the precipitates in the 6 and 8 at% Ti alloys coalesce and develop an irregular, elongated morphology. After 1000 h of aging, replacement of W and Al with Ti increases both the mean radius, < R >, and volume fraction, phi, of the gamma'(L1(2))-phase from < R > = 463 nm and phi = 8% for 2 at% Ti to < R > = 722 nm and phi = 52% for 8 at% Ti. Composition measurements of the gamma(f.c.c.)-matrix and gamma'(L1(2))-precipitates demonstrate that Ti substitutes for W and Al in the gamma'(L1(2))-precipitates, increases the partitioning of W to gamma'(L1(2)), and changes the partitioning behavior of Al from a mild gamma'(L1(2))-former to a mild gamma(f.c.c.)-former. The grain boundaries in the aged alloys exhibit W-rich precipitates, most likely mu(Co7W6)-type, which do not destabilize the gamma(f.c.c.) plus gamma'(L1(2)) microstructure within the grains. Four important benefits accrue from replacing W and Al with Ti: (i) the alloys' mass density decrease; (ii) the gamma'(L1(2))-solvus temperature increases; (iii) the gamma'(L1(2)) volume fraction formed during aging at 1273 K (1000 degrees C) increases; and (iv) the 0.2% offset flow stress increases.

SO MATERIALS & DESIGN
AB The composition, phase transitions and isothermal oxidation dynamics of a new polycrystalline Ni-Cr-Co-W base superalloy are investigated using CALculation of PHAse Diagrams (CALPHAD), Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), ThermoGravimetric analysis (TG/dTG), Scanning Electron Microscope and Energy Dispersion Spectrum (SEM/EDS) methods. The microstructure of the designed alloy shows a uniform gamma matrix with the precipitates of rich-Ti cellular eta and rich-Nb acicular platelet delta phase, and no Topologically Close-packed Phases (TCPs) observed, and the oxide behavior obeys a parabolic law with a parabolic constant (k(p)) 2.945 mg(2)/(cm(4).h) at isothermal 1300(omicron)C for 30 hours. The oxide scales are composed of an outer loose oxide mixture containing Cr, Ni, Ti and Nb/Ta and generous pores presented for a volatilization of Cr2O3, and a dense aluminum-rich oxide layer.

TI Phase Composition and Cracking Behavior on TIG Cladding Layer of
   Co-8.8Al-9.8W-0.2B Superalloy Based on JMatPro Software
SO RARE METAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING
AB Co-Al-W superalloy is a novel cobalt-based superalloy with the precipitation strengthening phase of ternary compound gamma-Co-3(Al,W). In order to study the cracking behavior of Co-8.8A1-9.8W-0.2B cladding layer on 304 stainless steel with TIG welding, the phase composition and relative contents at different positions of the cladding layer were investigated by thermodynamic simulation calculation of JMatPro software and experimental verification. The results show that the phase composition is the same at different positions of the cladding layer, but the content of those phases are not alike. Combining phase composition and contents of the cladding layer, the surface cracks of cladding layer are mainly hot cracks, which come from the integrated effect of the thermal stress, the phase transformation stress and the Laves phase.

TI Influence of high-temperature annealing on morphological and
   compositional changes of phases in Ni-base single crystal superalloy
SO MATERIALS CHARACTERIZATION
AB Microstructure evolution during high temperature annealing of the CM186LC single crystal nickel-base super alloy in the temperature range of 900-1100 degrees C for up to 2500 h was investigated. Microstructural analyses were aimed at observing the changes in morphology of precipitates, in both two dimensions (2D) and three dimensions (3D). The changes in the chemical composition of constituting phases, caused by annealing, were also determined. Although no external stress was applied, after annealing at 1000 degrees C and 1100 degrees C the directional coalescence of the gamma' phase in directions parallel to secondary dendrite arms occurred. In the temperature range of 900-1100 degrees C, decomposition of the primary MC carbides took place. The primary carbides were fragmented into small plate-shaped particles, and secondary carbides were also formed. Additionally, in the investigated temperature range, the precipitates of topologically close packed (TCP) phases were found. Those precipitates, plate-like in shape, grew up to a length of several micrometres. Coalescence of the gamma' phase and formation of TCP precipitates during high temperature exposure of CM186LC was accompanied by decreases in the concentrations of Co, Cr, W and Re in the gamma phase.

TI Lattice parameter misfit evolution during creep of a cobalt-based
   superalloy single crystal with cuboidal and rafted gamma-prime
   microstructures
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB A [h00] oriented Co-based superalloy single crystal was crept under tension at 940 degrees C/100 MPa, resulting in a P-type raft morphology with extensive particle coalescence along the [h00] loading direction. However, particle coalescence was also observed in two perpendicular directions on the (h00) plane, normal to the loading axis. Tensile creep experiments were performed with in-situ neutron diffraction at 800 degrees C/500 MPa on this initially rafted gamma' microstructure, and for comparison at (i) 900 degrees C/260 MPa, and at (ii) 750 degrees C/875 MPa, both with initially cuboidal gamma' microstructures. The alloy was shown to exhibit a positive lattice parameter misfit, and during the first hour of creep at 900 degrees C/260 MPa, the lattice parameter evolution indicated changes in phase composition associated with gamma' dissolution as the alloy achieved phase equilibrium at 900 degrees C. For all three in-situ creep measurements, there was a significant divergence of the gamma' and gamma lattice parameters as creep proceeded. The lattice parameter misfit values between the precipitates and the matrix approached their unconstrained values during creep, and were notably large compared to those of Ni-based superalloys. This is indicative of a loss of coherency at the precipitate/matrix interfaces. Such a loss of coherency at the precipitate/matrix interfaces will likely degrade certain mechanical properties such as fatigue resistance, as has been shown for the Ni-based superalloys.

TI Effect of tungsten concentration on microstructures of
   Co-10Ni-6Al-(0,2,4,6) W-6Ti (at%) cobalt-based superalloys
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB The effects of reducing the W concentration (and concomitantly mass density) of Co-10Ni-6A1-xW-6Ti at% Co-based superalloys, with a gamma(f.c.c.) plus gamma'(L1(2)) microstructure, is investigated for a series of alloys with W concentrations of 6 at% (baseline alloy), 4 and 2 at% (W-reduced) and 0 at% (W-free). The gamma'(L1(2)) solvus temperature decreases strongly (by 46 degrees C per 1 at% reduction in W), while the liquidus and solvus temperatures decrease mildly (3-5 degrees C per 1 at% W reduction) as measured by differential scanning calorimetry. Scanning electron microscopy was used to image phase formation in all alloys. When aging at 900 or 1000 degrees C for 256 h, the W reduction does not result in the appearance of additional phases within the grains beyond the gamma(f.c.c.) and gamma'(L1(2)) phases present in the original alloy. Grain-boundary precipitates are present for all alloy compositions: W-rich or W-free precipitates after aging at 1000 degrees C, and coarsened gamma'(L1(2)) precipitates after aging at 900 degrees C. The composition of grain boundary precipitates were measured with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Vickers microhardness values decrease with decreasing W content, due to a reduction in gamma'(L1(2)) precipitation and 'reduced solid-solution strengthening.

TI Effects Effects of Ni/Co ratio and mechanical alloying on
   characteristics and sintering behavior of W-Ni-Co tungsten heavy alloys
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB W-Ni-Co tungsten heavy alloys with a varied Ni/Co ratio produced by mechanical alloying have been investigated in this study. The change of the Ni/Co ratio and the processing of mechanical alloying are important to influence characteristics and sintering behavior of the model materials. The results show that the high Ni/Co ratio facilitates the process of solid phase sintering and promotes a fine-grained structure and a relatively high hardness. However, the behavior of liquid phase sintering was found in the alloys with the low Ni/Co ratio condition, corresponding to a coarse-grained structure and decrease in hardness. The mechanisms of the transition between the solid and liquid states during sintering has been discussed in this work, which can be associated with the amount of binder phase and its composition, tungsten grain size, deformation strain and sintering conditions.

TI Preparation and Structure of Al plus Si Codeposited Coatings on.
   Ni-based Superalloys
SO RARE METAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING
AB The Al+Si codeposited coatings were prepared on DZ417G superalloy substrates by aluminization and siliconization using pack cementation. XRD, SEM and EDS were used to study the microstructure and morphology of coatings. The results show that during the co-deposition process, the structure formed on the coating surface changes with the change of Al and Si contents. In addition, the post heat-treatment also has an effect on the structure of coatings. When the composition (in wt%) of the packs is XAl-4NH(4)Cl-4Si-(92-X)Al2O3 (X= I, 4 and 6), the corresponding structures of the coatings are NiSi and Ni2Al3 after pack cementation, respectively. When Si content increases to 6 wt% and 10 wt%, the structure of the coatings is also NiSi or Ni2Al3. After post heat-treatment, because of Ni, Cr and Mo diffusion from the substrate, NiSi transforms to AlNi6Si3 or S-Ni2Si, while Ni2Al3 transforms to beta-NiAl. The Si level in the beta-NiAl coatings is very small. Cr or Mo dissolves into AlNi6Si3, delta-Ni2Si and beta-NiAl. Al content plays a role in the formations of coatings. When Al content is low in the pack, the structure of coatings is NiSi after Al + Si codeposition. However, when the Al content is above 4 wt%, the structures of coatings are Ni2Al3 after pack cementation. Cr-rich AlNi6Si3, Cr- and Mo-rich delta-Ni2Si as well as beta-NiAl coatings are formed after Al + Si codeposition followed by post heat-treatment.

AB The microstructure and sliding wear, properties of Co-Cr-W alloy (Stellite 6) coatings were studied in the dependence on the deposition technology. The HVOF as-sprayed, laser remelted HVOF sprayed and laser clad coatings were evaluated by SEM, XRD and ASTM G-133 reciprocating sliding wear test. In dependence on used deposition technology, the microstructure of coating varied namely in terms of grain size and phase composition. The XRD analyses in the wear track revealed that the strain-induced fcc-to-hcp transformation is taking part during wear of laser remelted HVOF sprayed coatings. The difference of the phase composition, grain size and strain-induced fcc-to-hcp transformation was shown to be responsible for differences in the sliding wear behaviour. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TI On the crystallography and composition of topologically close-packed
   phases in ATI 718Plus (R)
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB ATI 718Pluse (R) is a nickel-based superalloy developed to replace Inconel 718 in aero engines for static and rotating applications. Here, the long-term stability of the alloy was studied and it was found that topologically close-packed (TCP) phases can form at the gamma-eta interface or, less frequently, at grain boundaries. Conventional and scanning transmission electron microscopy techniques were applied to elucidate the crystal structure and composition of these TCP precipitates. The precipitates were found to be tetragonal sigma phase and hexagonal C14 Laves phase, both being enriched in Cr, Co, Fe and Mo though sigma has a higher Cr and lower Nb content. The precipitates were observed to be heavily faulted along multiple planes. In addition, the disorientations between the TCP phases and neighbouring eta/gamma were determined using scanning precession electron diffraction and evaluated in axis-angle space. This work therefore provides a series of compositional and crystallographic insights that may be used to guide future alloy design. (C) 2017 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Investigation on Conductive Layer, Delamination, and Recast Layer
   Characteristics of Electro-discharge Machined Holes in TBCs
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING AND PERFORMANCE
AB In this study, electrical discharge machining (EDM) is used to directly drill normal effusion cooling holes in thermal-barrier-coated nickel-based superalloys (TBCs) via the assisting electrode method. The formation of the conductive layer was studied using scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive spectroscopy. The effects of the EDM process parameters including peak current, pulse duration, and duty cycle on delamination and recast layer characteristics were investigated. The analysis results indicate that the conductive layer possesses a feature of bilayer structure for the EDM of TBCs. The bottom layer is generated first due to the deposition of carbon-based products and molten brass debris, and its composition primarily contains C, Cu, Zr, and Zn; the surface layer is the result of the overlying of subsequently molten superalloy debris and carbon-based products, and its composition primarily consists of Ni, C, Cr, Nb, Co, Al, Fe, Cu, and Zr. The microcracks of the superalloy substrate only reside in the recast layer during the EDM of TBCs. The thickness of recast layer sharply increases with increasing peak current, pulse duration, and duty cycle, respectively. The delamination occurs at the ceramic coating/bond coating interface for the EDM of drilling normal holes in TBCs, and it can be eliminated by the selection of low discharge energy and appropriate duty cycle. Additionally, the length of delamination increases with increasing peak current, pulse duration, and duty cycle, respectively. The spalling of ceramic coating appears at the entrance of the hole due to the thermal-shock brittle fracture if excessive peak current, pulse duration, or duty cycle is selected.

TI Application of Computational Thermodynamics to the Design of a
   Co-Ni-Based gamma'-Strengthened Superalloy
SO METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND
   MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB A currently available commercial Calphad thermodynamic database was utilized to investigate its applicability to alloy design in the new class of Co-Ni-based gamma'-strengthened high-temperature alloys. A simple primary design criterion was chosen: maximize the gamma' solvus temperature in the six-component Co-Ni-Al-Ti-W-Ta system while ensuring no formation of secondary, potentially deleterious phases. Secondary design considerations included the effects of alloying elements on equilibrium gamma' volume fraction and on solidus and liquidus temperatures. The identified composition, Co-30Ni-9Al-3Ti-7W-2Ta-0.1B (expressed in mole percent), representing a conservative estimate of the maximum allowable concentrations of alloying additions Al, Ti, W, and Ta, was subsequently produced and characterized. The experimentally measured gamma' solvus temperature of the new alloy was 1491 +/- 3 K (1218 +/- 3 A degrees C), about 35 K (35 A degrees C) above any previously reported two-phase gamma-gamma' Co-(Ni)-based alloy. No secondary phases were observed in the alloy after annealing at temperatures between 1173 K and 1473 K (900 A degrees C and 1200 A degrees C). Additional alloy compositions with experimentally measured gamma' solvus temperatures in excess of 1533 K (1260 A degrees C) were also identified employing the same basic approach. The efficacy of currently available thermodynamic databases in their application to Co-based gamma'-strengthened superalloy development is discussed, including expanding design efforts to include additional alloying elements, as well as specific areas for improvement of future databases.

TI Fretting wear of pure cobalt chromium and nickel to identify the
   distinct roles of HS25 alloying elements in high temperature glaze layer
   formation
SO WEAR
AB HS25 cobalt-based superalloy was investigated between 100 and 600 degrees C under fretting wear (small amplitude reciprocating displacements) in a cross-cylinder contact. Tribological behavior was compared to pure cobalt, chromium and nickel tested under the same conditions and analyzed in terms of friction, wear, interface morphology and chemical composition by SEM-EDX and Raman spectroscopy. On HS25, the tribological tests resulted in the formation of a "glaze layer" of ground and compacted wear debris, which was protective against severe wear and high friction above 250 degrees C. Similar glaze layers were found for cobalt-cobalt (Co//Co) contacts, suggesting the determining role of cobalt in glaze layer formation whereas worn Cr//Cr and Ni//Ni interfaces exhibited poorly sintered debris and respectively adhesive and abrasive wear. To identify the role of alloying elements in glaze layer formation, the oxides formed in the interface were studied in terms of composition and thermal stability. As sintering appears to be a determining factor in glaze layer formation, the diffusion properties of cobalt and its oxides are emphasized. The strengthening and corrosion resistance properties of chromium and nickel in the alloy are also discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Towards understanding the effects of magnesium addition on
   microstructural and thermal properties of NiAlCr alloys in as-cast and
   heat treated states
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB The effects of magnesium addition on the microstructure, hardness, chemical composition and thermal expansion coefficient of NiAlCr alloys in as-cast and heat-treated states were studied. NiAlCr alloys containing 1, 2.5 and 3.8 at.% Mg were prepared via atmosphere-controlled induction melting following vacuum arc melting. According to the XRD results, as-cast alloys were mainly composed of martensite, beta-NiAl and gamma'-Ni3Al. High amounts of Mg in alloys resulted in a slight increase in CTE. Increasing Mg also changed the morphology of the interdendritic Ni3Al phase from continuous network to discontinuous structure, resulting in Ni2Mg precipitates with hardness of 1280 HV0.002. In the furnace cooling procedure following the annealing procedure at 1050 degrees C for 96 h, martensite completely transformed into beta-NiAl with alpha-Cr precipitates. The single phase Ni3Al transformed into Al0.9Ni4.22-Ni3Al lamellar structure and Ni2Mg phase disappeared. The presence of Mg in solid solution did not influence CTE of the alloys.

TI An Atom Probe Tomography study of site preference and partitioning in a
   nickel-based superalloy
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB Atom Probe Tomography (APT) has been utilised for an in-depth examination of the commercial polycrystalline Ni-based superalloy RR1000, assessing compositions of the primary, secondary and tertiary gamma' phases. Clear differences in the phase chemistries are noted, particularly for the tertiary gamma' to which much of the alloy strength is attributed. Trace amounts of Hf are found to segregate strongly to the primary and secondary gamma' phases, but also exhibit an extended diffusion profile across the gamma-gamma' interface up to 80 nm wide. Ti, Al and Mo demonstrate similar, yet not as pronounced diffusion profiles, indicating assumed phase chemistries may not be representative of those regions adjacent to the gamma-gamma' interface. Within gamma', unique element site-occupancy preferences for this alloy were identified. Finally, the grain boundary chemistry across a gamma-gamma interface and that of an intragranular boride were analysed, identifying the latter as a mixed M5B3 boride rich in Mo and Cr. These demonstrate further the depth of information on Ni-alloys accessible by APT, while the overall implications of results in comparison with other in-service/model alloys are also discussed.

TI Effect of alloy composition on the oxidation-induced boron depletion in
   cast Ni-base superalloy components
SO MATERIALS AND CORROSION-WERKSTOFFE UND KORROSION
AB The high temperature air oxidation of the two conventionally cast Ni-based superalloys Rene 80 containing 92wtppm boron and CM 247 containing 110wtppm of boron was studied at temperatures between 850 and 1050 degrees C and times ranging from 1 to 100h. Analysis by GD-OES and SEM/WDX/EBSD revealed the surface scale on Rene 80 after exposure at 1050 degrees C to consist of Cr2O3 with TiO2 in the outer part and BCrO3 and CrTi2O5 in the inner part. Internal Al2O3 precipitates were present below the external scale. After 1h exposure of CM 247 an inner dense alumina scale formed over eutectic alloy regions containing coarse precipitates. Over dendritic regions a Cr-rich oxide scale with BCrO3-precipitates formed initially and aluminum was internally oxidized. After longer oxidation times an alumina sub-scale grew from the internal precipitates, and oxidation of the initially present depleted alloy zones resulted in formation of outer Ni and Co rich oxides. In both alloys, boron depletion in the bulk alloy occurred due to formation of the mentioned boron rich oxide. The extent of depletion was substantially higher for the chromia forming Rene 80 than for CM 247. In the latter material the boron depletion was suppressed after the formation of the dense, inner alumina scale.

AB Co-based superalloy, ECY768, applied on gas turbine vanes, shows the presence of cracks after service. EBSD studies revealed hcp transformation in the base material near cracked regions. This phase arises from a martensitic transformation of fcc matrix and bestows high fragility. The phase transformation is related to temperature and loading distribution that characterises components in service. However, at the service temperatures, the hcp transformation is not expected for ECY768. An in-house thermodynamic database was developed using the Calphad approach and thermodynamic calculations were applied to the complicated alloy composition for phase stability range evaluation. Moreover, a testing campaign was planned to artificially create this martensitic transformation and to comprehend the influence of plastic strain on fcc-hcp transformation. The transformation mechanisms were understood and some methods were developed for hcp-phase removal through refurbishment heat treatment.

TI Microstructural characterization of the M23C6 carbide in a long-term
   aged Ni-based superalloy
SO PHILOSOPHICAL MAGAZINE LETTERS
AB The microstructural features of M23C6 carbide in a long-term aged heat- and corrosion-resistant Ni-based superalloy have been investigated in detail using various kinds of transmission electron microscope (TEM) techniques. It is found that TEM contrast, which is related to structural and chemical inhomogeneities inside the grains, always exists in the interior of grains in the alloy. The structure of these inhomogeneous regions has been determined to be the same as that of the and t-M23C6 phases, where t-M23C6 indicates a transitional and metastable phase. Although possessing the same structure as the M23C6 phase, the chemical composition of the t-M23C6 is different from that of the M23C6 phase. Compared with M23C6, t-M23C6 is richer in Ni, Co, Al and Ti but poorer in W, Mo and Cr. This phenomenon of structural and chemical inhomogeneity demonstrates that pristine M23C6 carbide (p-M23C6) precipitated in standard heat-treated samples is unstable. Therefore, upon long-term ageing treatment, Ni, Co, Al and Ti may locally enrich inside the p-M23C6 phase, finally forming the phase, which can be described by the decomposition reaction p-M23C6M23C6+.

   application to the recycling of Ni-Co-Fe-based end-of-life superalloys
   via remelting
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MINERALS METALLURGY AND MATERIALS
AB To design optimal pyrometallurgical processes for nickel and cobalt recycling, and more particularly for the end-of-life process of Ni-Co-Fe-based end-of-life (EoL) superalloys, knowledge of their activity coefficients in slags is essential. In this study, the activity coefficients of NiO and CoO in CaO-Al2O3-SiO2 slag, a candidate slag used for the EoL superalloy remelting process, were measured using gas/slag/metal equilibrium experiments. These activity coefficients were then used to consider the recycling efficiency of nickel and cobalt by remelting EoL superalloys using CaO-Al2O3-SiO2 slag. The activity coefficients of NiO and CoO in CaO-Al2O3-SiO2 slag both show a positive deviation from Raoult's law, with values that vary from 1 to 5 depending on the change in basicity. The activity coefficients of NiO and CoO peak in the slag with a composition near B = (%CaO)/(%SiO2) = 1, where B is the basicity. We observed that controlling the slag composition at approximately B = 1 effectively reduces the cobalt and nickel oxidation losses and promotes the oxidation removal of iron during the remelting process of EoL superalloys.

AB Fe18Ni23Co25Cr21Mo8WNb3C2 superalloy powders were synthesized via an atomization method, and phase composition, morphology and thermal stability of the composite powders were characterized. Afterwards, Fe-Ni-Co-based superalloy was prepared by vacuum hot-pressing sintering and further second sintering of atomized alloy powders. The results show that the sintered Fe-Ni-Co-based superalloy mainly consists of austenite phase and M6C carbide phase that is a strengthening phase. The superalloy has uniform structure, high tensile strength and low elongation after vacuum hot-pressing sintering. After further second sintering, the microstructure of the superalloy becomes more homogeneous, the tensile strength decreases slightly and the elongation rate significantly increases.

TI Thermomechanical behavior of intermetallic Ni-Al-Co and Ti-Al-Nb based
   alloys during isothermal deformation
SO LETTERS ON MATERIALS-PIS MA O MATERIALAKH
AB Different plastic deformation thermo-mechanical terms were tried out on Ni-Al-Co-based alloy in cast, prepressed and deformed conditions, and on Ti-Al-Nb-based alloy in cast and deformed conditions by yielding specimens with varying rate of deformation in interval between 10 and 70 % and varying deformation temperature in interval between 900 and 1200 degrees.. Diagrams of tensile strength and elongation upon temperature dependence in Ni-Al-Co-based alloy in cast prepressed and deformed conditions and Ti-Al-Nb-based alloy in cast and deformed conditions are designed. Application features of protective technological coating based on glass enamel in isothermal forging of workpiece are examined. The results of heatresistance tests on Ni-Al-Co and Ti-Al-Nb-based alloys coated with different compositions of protection technological coating are shown. During the deformation these technological coatings have to be high temperature lubricant, that reduce force up to two times, necessary to deform workpiece. These protection technological coatings can be used at temperatures under 1250 degrees. The results of the work show, that optimal temperature for deformation intermetallic Ni-Al-Co-based superaloy workpiece were between 1140 and 1160 degrees.. Dropping temperature below 1140 degrees. leads to crack growing because of significant reduction of ductility. The results of the work show, that optimal temperature for deformation intermetallic Ti-Al-Nb-based workpiece were between 1150 and 1200 degrees.

TI Thermodynamic Simulation Calculation of Co-8.8Al-9.8W Alloy with
   Different B Contents Based on JMatPro Software
SO RARE METAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING
AB The precipitation behavior of Co-8.8A1-9.8W alloy with different B contents has been studied by thermodynamic simulation calculation of JMatPro software in order to research the effect of boron additions on precipitation phases of new Co base superalloy. The result shows that the precipitation temperature and precipitation quantity of gamma phase and mu-Co7W6 phase decrease with the increases of B content, whereas the precipitation temperature and precipitation quantity of eta-Co3Al phase increase. Finally, the result was explained from the aspect of boride phases and the effect of B on composition of precipitation. It suggests that with the increase of B content, the content of each element of solid-liquid equilibrium phase has a growing difference when gamma phase precipitates, and thus it is only decreasing the temperature and increasing the degree of super cooling that can satisfy gamma phase nucleation and growth. Therefore, with the increase of B content, the content of gamma phase gets less and the precipitation temperature becomes lower. The precipitation of borides leads to solid solution of much Co and W, which increases the Al content in the solid-liquid equilibrium phase and promotes the precipitation of Co3Al.

TI Phase Formation and Oxidation Behavior at 500 degrees C in a Ni-Co-Al
   Thin-Film Materials Library
SO ACS COMBINATORIAL SCIENCE
AB The complete ternary system Ni-Co-Al was fabricated as a thin film materials library by combinatorial magnetron sputtering and was annealed subsequently in several steps in Ar and under atmospheric conditions at 500 degrees C. Ni-Co-Al is the base system for both Ni- and Co-based superalloys. Therefore, the phases occurring in this system and their oxidation behavior is of high interest. The Ni-Co-Al materials library was investigated using high-throughput characterization methods such as optical measurements, resistance screening, automated EDX, automated XRD, and XPS. From the obtained data a thin film phase diagram for the Ni-Co-Al system in its state after annealing at 500 degrees C in air was established. Furthermore, a surface oxide composition map of the full Ni-Co-Al system for oxidation at 500 degrees C was concluded. As a result, it could be shown that at 500 degrees C an amount of 10 at. % Al is necessary for a Ni-Co-Al thin film to produce a protective Al-oxide scale.

TI Phase structure, morphology evolution and protective behaviors of
   chemical vapor deposited (Ni, Pt)Al coatings
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB A chemical vapor deposited (CVD) aluminizing process had been employed to deposit platinum modified aluminide coatings on the nickel-based single-crystal superalloys. The kinetics behavior, phase evolution, microstructure and chemical composition of the (Ni, Pt)Al coatings after oxidation and hot corrosion tests were studied in detail. After isothermal oxidation test, a protective alpha-Al2O3 scale is formed on the coating surface and, two new phases of (Ni, Pt)(3)Al-4 and gamma'-(Ni, Pt)(3)Al due to phase transformation reactions occur in the aluminide layer. The inward diffusion of Al element toward the substrate and, formation of micro-pores in the interface of aluminide layer and interdiffusion zone are probably the main degradation modes of the coating. Corrosive medium including of mixed of aviation fuels and artificial seawater has not serious deterioration of the coating after hot corrosion and furthermore a network of grain boundary ridges is still co-existed on the coating surface, although large of micro-pores and some of grain boundaries are appeared within the aluminide layer.

TI Stability of TaC precipitates in a Co-Re-based alloy being developed for
   ultra-high-temperature applications
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED CRYSTALLOGRAPHY
AB Co-Re alloys are being developed for ultra-high-temperature applications to supplement Ni-based superalloys in future gas turbines. The main goal of the alloy development is to increase the maximum service temperature of the alloy beyond 1473 K, i.e. at least 100 K more than the present single-crystal Ni-based superalloy turbine blades. Co-Re alloys are strengthened by carbide phases, particularly the monocarbide of Ta. The binary TaC phase is stable at very high temperatures, much greater than the melting temperature of superalloys and Co-Re alloys. However, its stability within the Co-Re-Cr system has never been studied systematically. In this study an alloy with the composition Co-17Re-23Cr-1.2Ta-2.6C was investigated using complementary methods of small-angle neutron scattering (SANS), scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and neutron diffraction. Samples heat treated externally and samples heated in situ during diffraction experiments exhibited stable TaC precipitates at temperatures up to 1573 K. The size and volume fraction of fine TaC precipitates (up to 100 nm) were characterized at high temperatures with in situ SANS measurements. Moreover, SANS was used to monitor precipitate formation during cooling from high temperatures. When the alloy is heated the matrix undergoes an allotropic phase transformation from the "phase (hexagonal close-packed) to the gamma phase (face-centred cubic), and the influence on the strengthening TaC precipitates was also studied with in situ SANS. The results show that the TaC phase is stable and at these high temperatures the precipitates coarsen but still remain. This makes the TaC precipitates attractive and the Co-Re alloys a promising candidate for high-temperature application.

TI Phase Equilibria and Microstructural Evolution in Ternary Co-Al-W
   Between 750 and 1100 A degrees C
SO JOURNAL OF PHASE EQUILIBRIA AND DIFFUSION
AB Phase equilibria between 750 and 1100 A degrees C in the Co-rich portion of the Co-Al-W ternary system are investigated via isothermal annealing of five ternary alloy compositions. At temperatures of 900 A degrees C and below, the phase diagram is dominated by a three-phase tie-triangle between gamma, D0(19), and B2. The 1000 A degrees C section contains two three-phase tie-triangles, gamma A + D0(19) + mu and gamma + B2 + mu; while only one, gamma + B2 + mu, exists at 1100 A degrees C. Results at 950 A degrees C suggest that it is possible that gamma' is in equilibrium, with four out of five compositions exhibiting microstructures supporting its thermodynamic stability, and the fifth composition containing only a very small amount of a fourth phase. However, if true, the temperature range of gamma' stability would be quite small, and it is more likely that the kinetics of gamma' dissolution are the cause of its persistence at 950 A degrees C. At 850 A degrees C, gamma' is observed to dissolve more rapidly than at 900 A degrees C where dissolution exceeds 8000 h. A time-temperature-transformation diagram constructed from the combined results exhibits a classic nose-shape indicative of the tradeoff between thermodynamics and kinetics. This further supports a small driving force as the reason for the persistence of gamma' in the microstructures of Co-Al-W alloys at 900 and 950 A degrees C. The measured equilibrium phase compositions and five corresponding isothermal sections of the phase diagram will provide essential data for constructing a new thermodynamic description of ternary Co-Al-W.

TI Oxidation and Hot Corrosion Behavior of Plasma-Sprayed MCrAlY-Cr2O3
   Coatings
SO JOURNAL OF THERMAL SPRAY TECHNOLOGY
AB The oxidation and hot corrosion behavior of two atmospheric plasma-sprayed NiCoCrAlY-Cr2O3 and CoNiCrAlY-Cr2O3 coatings, which are primarily designed for wear applications at high temperature, were investigated in this study. The two coatings were exposed to air and molten salt (75%Na2SO4-25%NaCl) environment at 800 A degrees C under cyclic conditions. Oxidation and hot corrosion kinetic curves were obtained by thermogravimetric technique. X-ray diffraction analysis and scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive x-ray spectrometry were employed to characterize the coatings' microstructure, surface oxides, and composition. The results showed that both coatings provided the necessary oxidation resistance with oxidation rates of about 1.03 x 10(-2) and 1.36 x 10(-2) mg/cm(2) h, respectively. The excellent oxidation behavior of these two coatings is attributed to formation of protective (Ni,Co)Cr2O4 spinel on the surface, while as-deposited Cr2O3 in the coatings also acted as a barrier to diffusion of oxidative and corrosive substances. The greater presence of Co in the CoNiCrAlY-Cr2O3 coating restrained internal diffusion of sulfur and slowed down the coating's degradation. Thus, the CoNiCrAlY-Cr2O3 coating was found to be more protective than the NiCoCrAlY-Cr2O3 coating under hot corrosion condition.

TI On the role of processing parameters in sintered new Co-based (W,Al)
   alloys
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB The demand for enhanced material performance and efficiency in high-temperature applications has motivated the development of novel Co-based superalloys. Co-Al-W-based superalloys with the gamma/gamma' structure have suitable properties for use at high temperature and are good candidates for replacing Ni-based superalloys in some applications. The current generation of Co-Al-W-based alloys has superior wear, corrosion, and oxidation resistance. The poor precipitation strengthening of these alloys compared to that of Ni-based superalloys can be overcome by designing the alloying system to promote gamma'-Co-3(Al, W) precipitation. In this work, the compositions of the selected Co-Al-W-based alloys were chosen because they improve the precipitation strengthening of the alloys. Starting from powders, the materials were fabricated by mechanical alloying (MA) and subsequently consolidated by field assisted hot pressing (FAHP). The prepared Co-Al-W superalloys have a large amount of well-dispersed nanoprecipitates in their microstructures and have nearly full density. The effects of the MA and consolidation process (FAHP) conditions on the microstructures and mechanical properties of selected samples are determined by comparing the samples. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TI MICROSTRUCTURE EVOLUTION AND INTERFACIAL FORMATION MECHANISM OF WIDE GAP
   BRAZING OF DD5 SINGLE CRYSTAL SUPERALLOY
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB Ni-based single-crystal superalloy DD5 has excellent high temperature properties, which is the preferred raw material for aero-engine turbine blade in recent year. In this research, DD5 superalloy was brazed by different contents of Ni-Co-Cr-W-B+DD99 mixed powder filler alloy. The microstructure evolution and interfacial formation mechanism of DD5 superalloy brazing joint were analyzed by SEM and EPMA. The mechanical properties of joint after solid solution treatment and aging treatment were tested. The results show that gamma-Ni primary phase formed firstly in the Ni-Co-Cr-W-B/DD99 interface during the brazing process, and then B element segregated and precipitated to fine granular M3B2 type boride. The residual liquid phase solidified and formed lastly to the M3B2 phase, gamma+gamma' eutectic phase and gamma-Ni+Ni3B+CrB eutectic phase during cooling. With increasing the ratio of DD99 in mixed powder filler alloy, the low melting point eutectic phase and borides in the joint decrease and the uniformity of composition and microstructure of joint improve. When the ratio of DD99 increased to 70% (mass fraction) in the mixed powder filler alloy, it can be observed that element of B diffused to DD99 additive powder which resulted in the decrease of low melting point eutectic phases and brittle compounds. The high temperature tensile properties of joint is 1010 MPa at 870 degrees C.

TI The Minor Precipitation at the Final Stage of U720Li Solidification
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA-ENGLISH LETTERS
AB The minor precipitations caused by B and Zr which are the normal constituents of U720Li alloy have been studied by analyzing the solidification process and the composition evolution. The present study aims to supply the elementary information about the existing form of B and Zr in the as-cast microstructure, which is helpful for the subsequent processing, such as homogenization treatment. The M3B2 and Ni5Zr phases were observed in the U720Li alloy in as-cast state, which were usually accompanying with each other together with eta-Ni3Ti phase at the edge of eutectic (gamma + gamma'). Combining the DTA analysis and heating and quenching tests, the solidification sequence was determined to be the following: gamma matrix, eutectic (gamma + gamma'), eta-Ni3Ti, M3B2 and Ni5Zr. The in situ composition analysis by EDS and EPMA revealed that the precipitation and microstructure were governed by the composition evolution in the liquids. The solidification of gamma matrix increased the Ti concentration in the residual liquids and resulted in the eutectic (gamma + gamma') formation; the (gamma + gamma') formation increased the Ti/Al radio in the liquids and the eta-Ni3Ti was formed in front of the eutectic (gamma + gamma'); the eta-Ni3Ti precipitation consumed up Al and Ti and increased the concentration of B, Mo and Cr, and M3B2 boride is formed; the previous precipitation of the phases consumed up most of the elements other than Ni and Zr, and Ni5Zr is formed finally. The melting points are in the ranges of 1130-1140 degrees C for Ni5Zr phase, 1180-1190 degrees C for M3B2 boride and 1190-1200 degrees C for eta-Ni3Ti phase.

TI Atom site preference and gamma '/gamma mismatch strain in Ni-Al-Co-Ti
   superalloys
SO INTERMETALLICS
AB The structure and chemistry of Ni-Co-Al-Ti quaternary superalloys are investigated at the micro structural and atomic scale. Atom probe tomograghy (APT) is used to quantify phase compositions and elemental partitioning behavior. Using aberration corrected electron microscopy, the site occupancy of the atoms within the A(3) B structure (L1(2)-type) gamma' phase is determined via atomic resolution energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). Ni is observed to preferentially occupy the A sub-lattice positions for all alloys, while Al and Ti occupy the B sub-lattice. In contrast, Co's site preference changes from a random distribution to the A sub-lattice as the alloy composition changes, in agreement with theoretical predictions from literature. Finally, the lattice strain across the 771, interfaces is measured as a function of alloy composition. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Effect of configuration and composition of interlayer on TLP joints of
   FSX-414 superalloy
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY
AB Different interlayers including commercial foils of MBF-80, MBF-60 and MBF-100 with the thickness of 50 pm and pure Ni-coating with the thickness of 10 mu m were used for TLP bonding of FSX-414 superalloy. TLP bonding was conducted at the optimum condition (1150 degrees C/5 min). The joints microstructures were studied using SEM and WDS/SEM was used for phase analysis. For MBF-80 interlayer, no eutectic phases were seen at the joint but some granular and needle-like phases were visible at the diffusion affected zone. Considerable amount of eutectic phases were visible at the joint made using MBF-60 interlayer which were identified as NiP2 and CrP. These phases were detected for MBF-100 interlayer as Co and Cr-rich borides. Isolated eutectic phases, analysed as Ni, Co, Cr and W-rich ones, were seen at the joints made using pure Ni-coating as the interlayer. Mechanical tests including microhardness and shear strength were conducted for all the samples. The highest shear strength and the lowest hardness of eutectic compounds were observed for the joints made using MBF-80 interlayer. This was in agreement with the lowest concentration of alloying elements at these compounds, obtained from SEM/WDS analysis. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI The thermal stability of topologically close-packed phases in the
   single-crystal Ni-base superalloy ERBO/1
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB In Ni-base superalloys, the addition of refractory elements such as Cr, Mo, Co, W, and Re is necessary to increase the creep resistance. Nevertheless, these elements induce the formation of different kinds of intermetallic phases, namely, the topologically close-packed (TCP) phases. This work focuses on intermetallic phases present in the second-generation single-crystal (SX) Ni-base superalloy ERBO/1. In the as-cast condition, the typical gamma/gamma' structure is accompanied by undesirable intermetallic phases located in the interdendritic regions. The nature of these precipitates as well as their thermal stability between 800 and 1200 A degrees C has been investigated by isothermal heat treatments. The investigation techniques include DSC, SEM, EDX, and TEM.

TI Microstructure characterization of Co-20Cr-(5,10)Al oxide dispersion
   strengthened superalloys
SO MATERIALS CHARACTERIZATION
AB In order to develop Co-based oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) superalloys with excellent mechanical properties and oxidation resistance at the temperature above 1000 degrees C, Co-20Cr-(5,10)Al ODS superalloys were designed and fabricated by mechanical alloying (MA), spark plasma sintering (SPS), hot rolling and the final annealing at 1200 degrees C. Two different phases were identified; the Co solid solution of a fcc structure, and the B2 phase highly enriched with Aluminum. Composition and volume fraction of both phases are almost consistent with the Co-Cr-Al ternary phase diagram computed with the Pandat software. Another coarse fcc phase with smaller content of oxide particles was also characterized. This phase was probably formed through an incipient melting at the initial stage of SPS process. Fine oxides particles are densely distributed inside both, the fcc solid solution and the B2 phase. Grain boundaries and phase boundaries are decorated with the oxide particles, which are beneficial to grains and phases stability at elevated temperature. The observed unique core-shell structure was characterized as Y2Hf7O17 type in a core and Y2Hf2O7 type at a periphery of the oxide particles. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Effect of Heat Treatment on the Microstructure and Properties of
   HVOF-Sprayed Co-Cr-W Coating
SO JOURNAL OF THERMAL SPRAY TECHNOLOGY
AB Co-Cr-W HVOF-sprayed protective coatings are used for their high oxidation and wear resistance. Apart from the oxidation resistance, the stability of their mechanical properties in relation to thermal loading is crucial with respect to the most common high-temperature application areas. This work is focused mainly on evaluation of the heat-induced changes in the phase composition and related mechanical properties. It was shown that the original powder, composed fully from face-centered cubic Co-based alloy, partly changes its phase composition during spraying to a hexagonal close-packed (hcp) structure. The annealing further increases the ratio of the hcp phase in the structure. The heat-induced phase changes are accompanied by an increase in the coatings' hardness and cohesion strength. The abrasive and adhesive wear behavior was evaluated. While the coatings' heat treatment had a positive effect on the coefficient of friction, the abrasive and adhesive wear resistance of annealed coating was lower compared to as-sprayed coating.

AB The paper presents the transmission electron microscope (TEM) investigations of the structure of Ni-Al-Cr-based superalloy which is obtained by directional crystallization technique. The structural TEM investigations are carried out in two stages: 1) annealing at 1150 degrees C for 1 h and 2) annealing at 1100 degrees C for 480 h. The qualitative and quantitative analysis is given for the structure, phase composition and morphology of heat-resisting alloy additionally alloyed by rhenium Re both in the original state and after thermal treatment. The heat-resisting alloy comprises similar to 70 at % Ni, similar to 17 at % Al and similar to 5 at % Cr. The total amount of the primary alloying elements of Mo, W, Ta, Ti, Co, La was similar to 7 at % and 0.4.t % Re. It is shown that the structure of the superalloy is represented by (gamma+gamma')-phase mixture which has a morphologically correct crystallographic orientation and quasi-monocrystalline structure. s-phase is formed in this superalloy due to rhenium. Since Re distribution in the alloy is not uniform, only a part of (gamma+gamma')-phase quasi-cuboids is distorted. It is shown that Re modification distorts the ideal structure of (gamma+gamma')-phase quasi-cuboids and results in the formation of beta-, chi-and sigma-phases.

TI The Thermal Stability and Strength of Highly Alloyed Ni3Al
SO MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS
AB In this study the Ll(2) gamma prime phase (based on Ni3Al) has been highly alloyed with Cr, Co, W, and Ta in order to examine the effects on strengthening and thermal stability. The order-disorder transition temperature of gamma prime is decreased with higher alloying content. Thermodynamic calculations show that the ordering enthalpy decreases as the entropy term increases. Conversely, the hardness can be 1.5 times higher comparing to that of a conventional Ni-based superalloy. This indicates that the strengthening effect of designing a gamma prime composition toward higher entropy is significant, due to greater lattice distortion and higher anti-phase boundary energy of gamma prime.

The method we used based on the Bauschinger effect. The changes in the dendritic microstructure and chemical composition were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectrometry. The phases micromechanical properties evolution were characterized by nanoindentation. The results show that the cumulative strain or strain energy density increase arouse the interdiffusion of atoms between the different phases and the phases equilibrium in SC was changed. It is established that the interdiffusion rate depends on elements atoms activation energy. The new gamma-gamma'-eutectic pools were formed in the primary dendrites region (with fine gamma/gamma'-phase) and as result the length of newly formed dendrites was decreased significantly. The maximal and plastic depth of nanoindentation were measured and the corresponding micromechanical properties of phases calculated.

TI Microsegregation and precipitates of an as-cast Co-based
   superalloy-microstructural characterization and phase stability
   modelling
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB The demand for increased efficiency of industrial gas turbines and aero engines drives the search for the next generation of materials. Promising candidates for such new materials are Co-based superalloys. We characterize the microsegregation and solidification of a multi-component Co-based superalloy and compare it to a ternary Co-Al-W compound and to two exemplary Ni-based superalloys by combining the experimental characterization of the as-cast microstructures with complementary modelling of phase stability. On the experimental side, we characterize the microstructure and precipitates by electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and determine the element distributions and microsegregation coefficients by electron probe microanalysis (EPMA). On the modelling side, we carry out solidification simulations and a structure map analysis in order to relate the local chemical composition with phase stability. We find that the microsegregation coefficients for the individual elements are very similar in the investigated Co-based and Ni-based superalloys. By interpreting the local chemical composition from EPMA with the structure map, we effectively unite the set of element distribution maps to compound maps with very good contrast of the dendritic microstructure. The resulting compound maps of the microstructure in terms of average band filling and atomic-size difference explain the formation of topologically close-packed phases in the interdendritic regions. We identify B2, C14, and D0(24) precipitates with chemical compositions that are in line with the structure map.

TI A new class of high strength high temperature Cobalt based gamma-gamma '
   Co-Mo-Al alloys stabilized with Ta addition
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB The present paper reports a new class of Co based superalloys that has gamma-gamma' microstructure and exhibits much lower density compared to other commercially available Co superalloys including Co-Al-W based alloys. The basic composition is Co-10Al-5Mo (at%) with addition of 2 at% Ta for stabilization of gamma' phase. The gamma-gamma' microstructure evolves through solutionising and aging treatment. Using first principles calculations, we observe that Ta plays a crucial role in stabilizing gamma' phase. By addition of Ta in the basic stoichiometric composition Co-3(Al, Mo), the enthalpy of formation (Delta H-f) of L1(2) structure (gamma' phase) becomes more negative in comparison to DO19 structure. The All of the L12 structure becomes further more negative by the occupancy of Ni and Ti atoms in the lattice suggesting an increase in the stability of the gamma' precipitates. Among large number of alloys studied experimentally, the paper presents results of detailed investigations on Co-10Al-5Mo-2Ta, Co-30Ni-10Al-5Mo-2Ta and Co-30Ni-10Al-5Mo-2Ta-2Ti. To evaluate the role alloying elements, atom probe tomography investigations were carried out to obtain partition coefficients for the constituent elements. The results show strong partitioning of Ni, Al, Ta and Ti in ordered gamma' precipitates. 2015 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Microstructural evolution of mechanically alloyed Ni-based alloys under
   high temperature oxidation
SO POWDER TECHNOLOGY
AB To further improve the cost-benefit of MCrAlX (X is a reactive element like Y, Hf, Ta, etc.) alloys, the microhardness, microstructure and oxidation behavior of two Ni-based alloys, Ni60Co30Al10 and Ni60Co10Cr20Al10 without reactive elements were studied by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and microhardness Vickers. These alloys were synthesized by mechanical alloying in a high energy ball mill and conventional sintering at 1100 degrees C under inert atmosphere. Milling time and Cr additions have a significant effect on microhardness of as-milled and sintered samples. Bulk samples were oxidized at 1000 degrees C for different times to analyze the possible growth of protective oxide scale, as well as the effect of Cr addition on the chemical composition of the oxide scale. After 3 h of oxidation the formation of Al2O3 oxide scale in the Ni60Co30Al10 alloy is evident. By reducing the Co content and incorporating 20 wt% of Cr, the formation of an Al2O3 oxide scale with the presence of Cr2O3 was observed. Even the formation of homogeneous, continuous and protective oxide products in the surface of samples is evident, the rnicrostructural changes after oxidation treatments have a significant effect on the decrease in microhardness of both alloys.

TI Isothermal aging of a gamma '-strengthened Co-Al-W alloy coated with
   vacuum plasma-sprayed MCrAlY bond coats
SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB Cobalt-based superalloys with a gamma/gamma' microstructure were discovered in 2006 and are currently being investigated as an alternative to nickel-based superalloys for high-temperature, high-load applications in gas turbine blades. They promise a better castability combined with a similar creep strength. Superalloy turbine blades are commonly coated with oxidation resistant bond coats. For this reason their compatibility needs to be studied. Co-9Al-9W specimens with a gamma/gamma' microstructure were coated with either a nickel-based or cobalt-based MCrAlY bond coat using vacuum plasma spraying. After aging at 900 degrees C in air for up to 500 h no decomposition of the gamma' phase was found in the bulk superalloy. The interdiffusion zone shows several different W-rich topologically close-packed phases arising from the dissolution of the gamma' phase in this region. The W-rich phases are identified to be mu phase for both bond coats and R phase for the nickel-based bond coat only. Their total volume is higher for the nickel-based bond coat. Therefore the cobalt-based bond coat is better suited for the Co-based superalloy substrate. Room temperature hardness and Young's modulus were measured using nanoindentation in the initial state and after heat treatment. A significantly higher Young's modulus was found for the cobalt-based bond coat (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Isothermal oxidation and hot corrosion behaviors of diffusion aluminide
   coatings deposited by chemical vapor deposition
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Aluminization has been employed on superalloys to form dense and adhesive alumina surface layers to prolong their service life at high temperature. A chemical vapor deposited aluminizing process had been employed to deposit nickel aluminide coatings on the nickel-based single-crystal superalloys. The kinetics behavior, phase evaluation, microstructure and chemical composition of the aluminide coatings after oxidation and hot corrosion tests were studied in detail. After isothermal oxidation test, a dense and protective alpha-Al2O3 surface layer is formed on the aluminized superalloy and phase transformation reactions occur in the aluminide layer and interdiffusion zone. The inward diffusion of Al element toward the substrate and formation of micro-pores in the interdiffusion zone are probably the main degradation modes of the aluminide coating. Corrosive medium including of mixed of aviation fuels and artificial seawater has not serious deterioration of aluminide coating after hot corrosion at 1123 K, although large of micro-pores and few of microcracks are observed within the aluminide layer, and the typical morphology of the aluminide layer becomes corse and disorder to a certain extent.

TI Dendrite Segregation in Ni3Al-Based Intermetallic Single Crystals
   Alloyed with Cr, Mo, W, Ti, Co, and Re
SO RUSSIAN METALLURGY
AB The character of dendrite segregation in Ni3Al-based intermetallic VKNA-type alloy single crystals with a dendritic-cellular structure is studied. Distribution coefficient k(d) of an alloying element (AE) in the alloy during solidification k(d) = c(d.a.I)/c(0) (c(0) is the AE content in the alloy (liquid phase composition), c(d.a.I) is the AE content in primary dendrite arms of the alloy (in the solid phase)) and segregation coefficient k(s) = c(d.a.I)/c(i.d) (c(i.d) is the AE content in the interdendritic space) have been found. A comparative study of the dendrite segregation parameters in VKNA-nype Ni3Al-based intermetallic alloys and the well-known ZhS36type nickel superalloy shows that the intermetallic alloys satisfy to the rule deduced for two- and three-component nickel-based superalloys: if an introduced AE increases the melting temperature of the basic metal, we have k(d) > 1 (Co, W, Re); if it decreases the melting temperature, we have k(d) < 1 (Al, Ti, Cr, Mo). Dendrite segregation coefficients k(s) are dependent on the proportion of the AE contents in the alloys. In nickel superalloys, the dendrite segregation of aluminum, tungsten, and rhenium is higher than that in the intermetallic alloys. The dendrite segregation coefficients of tungsten and rhenium is higher by a factor of 1.5-2 than that in the VKNA-type intermetallic alloys with a low content of refractory metals. This can be due to the retardation of diffusion of refractory metals in the solid phase of a nickel superalloy highly alloyed with these elements.

TI Oxidation Behavior of Selected Bond Coats Based on the gamma' plus gamma
   Structure and Their Performance in Thermal Barrier Coatings Deposited on
   a Nickel-Based Superalloy
SO OXIDATION OF METALS
AB Three bond coats based on the gamma'-Ni3Al + gamma-Ni microstructure were developed by diffusing pairs of Pt layers and metallic layers with selected compositions into a Ni-based superalloy. Thermal exposure tests at 1,150 A degrees C with 24-h cycling period to room temperature were used to evaluate the thermal stability and oxidation behavior of the bond coats as well as their performance in thermal barrier coating systems utilizing zirconia-7 wt% yttria as the top coat. It is shown that a bond coat developed by a Pt layer and a layer of Ni-6 wt% Re-0.5 wt% Y alloy outperforms the conventional gamma' + gamma Pt bond coats by more than two folds. Most evidence points out that the proper concentrations of Re and Y in the presence of balanced concentrations of other elements, particularly Al, Ti, Cr and Co can significantly enhance the thermal stability and oxidation resistance of gamma' + gamma Pt bond coats.

TI Effects of deposition temperature on the kinetics growth and protective
   properties of aluminide coatings
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Chemical vapor aluminizing is a major production technique used for producing aluminide coatings on gas turbine blades to form dense and adhesive alumina surface layers and further prolong their service lives at high temperature. A chemical vapor deposited aluminizing process had been employed to deposit nickel aluminide coatings under the different deposition temperature. The phase structure, morphology, chemical composition, kinetics growth mechanism and oxidation/corrosion behavior of the aluminide coatings were studied in detail. The results show that the phase structure, microstructure and composition of the aluminide coatings are strongly influenced by the deposition temperature during chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The higher is the deposition temperature, the easier is the formation of pure beta-NiAl phase. Along with the increment of the deposition temperature, the coatings' surface will become smooth and dense, while the ridges along grain boundaries can be simultaneously approach to flat in a certain extend. Large numbers of elements of Cr, Mo and W within diffusion zone that could probably form a thin film layer, which is usually so-called as diffusion barrier. The key step of growth of coating grain is the formation of a volatile aluminium subhalide by controlling of the suitable deposition temperature during CVD. Based on the results of isothermal oxidation and hot corrosion kinetics curves, the best deposition parameter can be gained among the four coatings when the deposition temperature is adopted to be 1323 K.

TI Production of Al-Co-Ni Ternary Alloys by the SHS Method for Use in
   Nickel Based Superalloys Manufacturing
SO HIGH TEMPERATURE MATERIALS AND PROCESSES
AB In this study, Al-Co-Ni ternary alloys were synthesized, in order to obtain low-cost starting material for Ni-based superalloy production, by a self-propagating high temperature synthesis (SHS) both under normal gravity conditions (a = 9.81 m/s(2)) and under high gravity conditions (up to 1000 g-force) by using a centrifugal machine. The mixture of Co3O4-NiO powder were reduced by Al powder for the production of SHS alloys with the estimated compositions of 5-10 mass% Al, 20-65 mass% Co, 25-75 mass% Ni. The effect of green mixture compositions and centrifugal overload on combustion temperature, alloy/slag separations, chemical composition and microstructure of final alloys were investigated. The chemical analysis results showed that production of SHS alloys were achieved by having up to 86.12% of Co and 92.32% of Ni recoveries. The highest metal recovery value was obtained in SHS alloy with the estimated composition of 10%Al-65%Co-25% Ni by the addition of 20% Al2O3 into the green mixture. The metal/slag separation efficiency increased by increasing the centrifugal overload.

TI Evolution of microstructure and mechanical properties of coated Co-base
   superalloys during heat treatment and thermal exposure
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB New gamma'-strengthened Co-base superalloys show an interesting potential for high temperature applications. However, protective coatings are needed as for Ni-base superalloys to ensure sufficient oxidation and corrosion resistance. Therefore the properties of a commercial coating on a multinary new gamma'-strengthened Co-base superalloy have been studied. Especially the influence of the coating process on the substrate also after long term annealing is discussed. It was found that the highly deformed areas at the coating-substrate interface indicated by a high local misorientation and caused by the sandblasting process led to a recrystallization of the interdiffusion zone during the age hardening heat treatment. A chemical gradient of gamma and gamma' promoting elements was found in the interdiffusion zone causing a change in hardness as measured by nanoindentation. Depending on the composition two separate recrystallized regions formed in the interdiffusion zone, one with single phase gamma-(Co,Ni) and the other with a cellular two phase microstructure of discontinuously grown gamma and gamma'.

TI A new tungsten-free gamma-gamma ' Co-Al-Mo-Nb-based superalloy
SO SCRIPTA MATERIALIA
AB We present the first report of a tungsten-free cobalt-based superalloy having a composition Co-10Al-5Mo-2Nb. The alloy is strengthened by cuboidal precipitates of metastable Co-3(Al,Mo,Nb) distributed throughout the microstructure. The precipitates are coherent with the face-centred cubic gamma-Co matrix and possess ordered Ll(2) structure. The microstructure is identical to the popular gamma-gamma' type nickel-based superalloys and that of recently reported Co-Al-W-based alloys. Being tungsten free, the reported alloy has higher specific proof stress compared to existing cobalt-based superalloys. (C) 2014 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Synthesis of a new tungsten-free gamma-gamma ' cobalt-based superalloy
   by tuning alloying additions
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB The paper presents the synthesis of a new class of gamma-gamma' cobalt-based superalloy that is free of tungsten as an alloying addition. It has much lower density and higher specific strength than the existing cobalt-based superalloys. The current superalloys have a base composition of Co-10Al and are further tuned by the addition of a binary combination of molybdenum and niobium, with the optimum composition of Co-10Al-5Mo-2Nb. The solvus temperature of the alloy (866 degrees C) can be further enhanced above 950 C by the addition of Ni to give the form Co-xNi-10Al-5Mo-2Nb, where x can be from 0 to 30 at.%. After heat treatment, these alloys exhibit a duplex microstructure with coherent cuboidal L1(2)-ordered precipitates (gamma') throughout the face-centred cubic matrix (gamma), yielding a microstructure that is very similar to nickel-based superalloys as well as recently developed Co-Al-W-based alloys. We show that the stability of the gamma' phase improves significantly with the nickel addition, which can be attributed to the increase in solvus temperature. A very high specific 0.2% proof stress of 94.3 MPa g(-1) cm(-3) at room temperature and 63.8 MPa g(-1) cm(-3) at 870 degrees C were obtained for alloy Co-30Ni-10Al-5Mo-2Nb. The remarkably high specific strength of these alloys makes this class of alloy a promising material for use at high temperature, including gas turbine applications. (C) 2014 Acta Materialia Inc.

TI Compositional variations for small-scale gamma prime (gamma ')
   precipitates formed at different cooling rates in an advanced Ni-based
   superalloy
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB Size-dependent compositional variations under different cooling regimes have been investigated for ordered L1(2)-structured gamma prime (gamma') precipitates in the commercial powder metallurgy Ni-based superalloy RR1000. Using scanning transmission electron microscope imaging combined with absorption-corrected energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, we have discovered large differences in the Al, Ti and Co compositions for gamma' precipitates in the size range 10-300 nm. Our experimental results, coupled with complementary thermodynamic calculations, demonstrate the importance of kinetic factors on precipitate composition in Ni-based superalloys. In particular, these results provide new evidence for the role of elemental diffusion kinetics and aluminium antisite atoms on the low-temperature growth kinetics of fine-scale gamma' precipitates. Our findings have important implications for understanding the microstructure and precipitation behaviour of Ni-based superalloys, suggesting a transition in the mechanism of vacancy-mediated diffusion of Al from intrasublattice exchange at high temperatures to intersublattice antisite-assisted exchange at low temperatures.

TI Microstructural characterization of a new mechanically alloyed Ni-base
   ODS superalloy powder
SO MATERIALS CHARACTERIZATION
AB The microstructure of a new Ni-base oxide dispersion strengthened superalloy powder was studied for high temperature gas turbine.applications after the mechanical alloying process. In this study, an atomized powder with a composition similar to the CMSX-10 superalloy was mechanically alloyed with yttria and Hf powders. The mechanically alloyed powder included only the supersaturated solid solution gamma phase without gamma' and yttria provided by severe plastic deformation, while after the 3-step aging, the gamma' phase was precipitated due to the partitioning of Al and Ta to the gamma' and Co, Cr, Re, W, and Mo to the gamma phase. Mechanical alloying modified the morphology of gamma' to the new coherent gamma-gamma' nanoscale lamellar structure to minimize the elastic strain energy of the precipitation, which yielded a low lattice misfit of 0.16% at high temperature. The gamma' lamellae aligned preferentially along the elastically soft [100] direction. Also, the precipitated oxide particles were refined in the gamma phase by adding Hf from large incoherent YAlO3 to fine semi-coherent Y2Hf2O7 oxide particles with the average size of 7 nm and low interparticle spacing of 76 nm.

TI Advanced Scale Bridging Microstructure Analysis of Single Crystal
   Ni-Base Superalloys
SO ADVANCED ENGINEERING MATERIALS
AB In the present work, we show how conventional and advanced mechanical, chemical, and microstructural methods can be used to characterize cast single crystal Ni-base superalloy (SX) plates across multiple length scales. Two types of microstructural heterogeneities are important, associated with the castmicrostructure (dendrites (D) and interdendritic (ID) regions - large scale heterogeneity) and with the well-known gamma/gamma' microstructure (small scale heterogeneity). Using electron probe microanalysis (EPMA), we can show that elements such as Re, Co, and Cr partition to the dendrites while ID regions contain more Al, Ta, and Ti. Analytical transmission electron microscopy and atom probe tomography (APT) show that Al, Ta, and Ti partition to the gamma' cubes while gamma channels show higher concentrations of Co, Cr, Re, and W. We can combine large scale (EPMA) and small-scale analytical methods (APT) to obtain reasonable estimates for gamma' volume fractions in the dendrites and in the ID regions. The chemical and mechanical properties of the SX plates studied in the present work are homogeneous, when they are determined from gamma' volumes with dimensions, which are significantly larger than the dendrite spacing. For the SX plates (140 mm x 100 mm x 20 mm) studied in the present work this holds for the average chemical composition as well as for elastic behavior and local creep properties. We highlight the potential of HRTEM and APT to contribute to a better understanding of the role of dislocations during coarsening of the gamma' phase and the effect of cooling rates after high temperature exposure on the microstructure.

TI Berkovich nanoindentation and deformation mechanisms in a hardmetal
   binder-like cobalt alloy
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB A cobalt-base solid solution is the most used binder for hardmetals (WC-Co cemented carbides) in a wide range of industrial applications. In the composite material such cobalt alloy is surrounded by hard carbides grains; thus, a direct evaluation of its intrinsic mechanical properties is not an easy task. In order to overcome this inconvenience, a model cobalt alloy with a composition similar to that exhibited by typical hardmetal binder (containing W and C in solid solution) was processed following a powder metallurgy route. Nanoindentation testing at different length scales has been performed to study the mechanical properties as well as to introduce plastic deformation in individual grains of the dilute face centered cubic (fcc) stabilized model Co-W-C alloy. It is found that it exhibits an isotropic mechanical response, without any evidence of indentation size effects. The main deformation mechanism activated during the indentation tests resulted to be deformation twinning, although combined with limited planar slip but with no evidence of stress-induced phase transformation. Such finding is related to the high W and C amounts dissolved in the model Co alloy studied, and its effect on stabilizing the fcc configuration and increasing the stacking fault energy. The effective use of small-length scale mechanical characterization protocols is finally discussed for understanding deformation response of binder-like alloys and optimizing microstructural design of hardmetals.

AB In order to make clear the mechanism of the directional coarsening (rafting) of gamma' phases in Ni-base superalloys under uni-axial tensile strain, molecular dynamics (MD) analysis Was applied to investigate dominant factors of strain-induced anisotropic diffusion of Al atoms and nanotexture change of fine dispersed gamma' precipitates. In this study, a simple interface structure model corresponding to the gamma/gamma' interface, which consisted of Ni as gamma and Ni3Al as gamma' structure, was used to analyze the effect of alloying element on diffusion properties. The diffusion constants of Al atoms were changed drastically by the dopant elements and their contents. When the lattice constant of the gamma phase was increased and its melting point was decreased by the addition of Cr or Al atoms, the strain-induced anisotropic diffusion of Al atoms in the gamma' phase was accelerated. On the other hand, the addition of Co decreased the diffusion significantly. Therefore, changes of lattice constant and melting point depending on the chemical composition of the gamma/gamma' interface are the dominant factors controlling the strain-induced anisotropic diffusion of Al atoms in the Ni-base superalloy.

TI A ternary Ni-Al-W EAM potential for Ni-based single crystal superalloys
SO PHYSICA B-CONDENSED MATTER
AB Based on experiments and first-principles calculations, a ternary Ni-Al-W embedded-atom-method (EAM) potential is constructed for the Ni-based single crystal superalloys. The potential predicts that W atoms do not tend to form clusters in gamma(Ni), which is consistent with experiments. The impurity diffusion of W in gamma(Ni) is investigated using the five-frequency model. The diffusion coefficients and the diffusion activation energy of W are in reasonable agreement with the data in literatures. By W doping, the lattice misfit between the two phases decreases and the elastic constants of gamma'(Ni3Al) increase. As for alloyed elements Co, Re and W, the pinning effect of solute atom on the gamma(Ni)/gamma'(Ni3Al) misfit dislocation increases with the increasing of the atomic radius. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

TI gamma' Phase Stability and Phase Equilibrium in Ternary Co-Al-W at 900 A
   degrees C
SO JOURNAL OF PHASE EQUILIBRIA AND DIFFUSION
AB Phase equilibria at 900 A degrees C in the Co-rich Co-Al-W ternary system are investigated through isothermal annealing of six alloy compositions for times up to 8000 h. The volume fraction of the L1(2)-gamma' phase co-existing with disordered FCC-gamma, B2 and D0(19) phases is found to steadily decrease with increasing annealing time indicating that it is unstable at 900 A degrees C. Additional heat treatments at 850 and 1000 A degrees C further suggest it is a nonequilibrium phase at all temperatures in the ternary system. The L1(2)-gamma' phase dissolves slowly with significant amounts remaining in some alloys after 8000 h at 900 A degrees C. However, the present work clearly indicates the microstructure is moving toward a three-phase equilibrium between gamma, D0(19), and B2. The collected compositional and phase equilibria information provide much needed data for improving the available thermodynamic assessments of the ternary Co-Al-W alloy system.

TI A New Polycrystalline Co-Ni Superalloy
SO JOM
AB In 2006, a new-ordered L1(2) phase, Co-3(Al,W), was discovered that can form coherently in a face-centered cubic (fcc) A1 Co matrix. Since then, a community has developed that is attempting to take these alloys forward into practical applications in gas turbines. A new candidate polycrystalline Co-Ni gamma/gamma' superalloy, V208C, is presented that has the nominal composition 36Co-35Ni-15Cr-10Al-3W-1Ta (at.%). The alloy was produced by conventional powder metallurgy superalloy methods. After forging, a gamma' fraction of similar to 56% and a secondary gamma' size of 88 nm were obtained, with a grain size of 2.5 mu m. The solvus temperature was 1000 degrees C. The density was found to be 8.52 g cm(-3), which is similar to existing Ni alloys with this level of gamma'. The alloy showed the flow stress anomaly and a yield strength of 920 MPa at room temperature and 820 MPa at 800 degrees C, similar to that of Mar-M247. These values are significantly higher than those found for either conventional solution and carbide-strengthened Co alloys or the gamma/gamma' Co superalloys presented in the literature thus far. The oxidation resistance, with a mass gain of 0.08 mg cm(-2) in 100 h at 800 degrees C, is also comparable with that of existing high-temperature Ni superalloys. These results suggest that Co-based and Co-Ni superalloys may hold some promise for the future in gas turbine applications.

TI Temporal evolution of non-equilibrium gamma ' precipitates in a rapidly
   quenched nickel base superalloy
SO INTERMETALLICS
AB The temporal evolution of non-equilibrium gamma' precipitates in a rapidly quenched and isothermally annealed commercial nickel base superalloy has been investigated by coupling transmission electron microscopy and atom probe tomography. When subjected to rapid quenching from above the gamma' solvus temperature, the supersaturated single phase gamma matrix appears to undergo compositional phase separation possibly via spinodal decomposition to form solute-rich and solute-depleted regions. The regions that have a depletion in Cr and Co undergo an ordering process resulting in the gamma' domains which exhibit a far from equilibrium composition. Upon isothermal annealing, the gamma/gamma' interface sharpens and the compositions of both gamma and gamma' phases approach equilibrium. The influence of a non-classical mechanism of gamma' precipitation on the size distribution of precipitates as well as the precipitate and matrix compositions, and its subsequent evolution during isothermal annealing has been discussed.

TI Discontinuous Precipitation of gamma ' Phase in Ni-Co-Al Alloys
SO JOM
AB Decomposition of nickel-base alloys by precipitation of the gamma' phase occurs either continuously (homogeneously) or discontinuously. Under certain conditions of solute content and temperature, discontinuous precipitation is observed. Ni-Al-Co alloys have been characterized by coupling atom probe tomography with transmission electron microscopy studies. The primary focus was to investigate the discontinuous precipitation of gamma and gamma' phases. When subjected to fast quenching after solution treatment, the gamma' precipitates exhibit a near-spherical shape and monomodal size distribution with an average size of less than 5 nm. After early stage annealing at 600A degrees C for 10 min, discontinuous precipitation nucleated near the grain boundaries while some regions of homogeneous gamma' precipitates were observed. Discontinuous gamma + gamma' product was completely transformed throughout the grain after 600A degrees C/1 h. On long-term annealing (600A degrees C/256 h), coarser gamma + gamma' lamellae products replaced the fine discontinuous products that exhibited after 1 h annealing at 600A degrees C. Equilibrium compositions of the gamma and gamma' phases were achieved in this coarsening stage. The gamma' phase has an Al content of 25 at.%, which is consistent with the as-quenched condition where the (Ni + Co)(3)Al stoichiometry is maintained after 600A degrees C/256 h annealing.

TI Computer simulation of phase transformation and plastic deformation in
   IN718 superalloy: Microstructural evolution during precipitation
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB Microstructural evolution during co-precipitation of gamma', gamma '' and delta phases from a supersaturated gamma matrix during aging of superalloy Inconel 718 (IN718) is investigated by computer simulation using the phase-field method. The precipitation model is quantitative, using as model inputs ab initio calculations of elastic constants, experimental data on lattice parameters, precipitate matrix orientation relationship, interfacial energy of each individual precipitate phase and interdiffusivities, and a Ni-Nb-Al pseudo-ternary thermodynamic database specifically developed for IN718. In order to simulate statistically representative multiphase microstructures observed in the alloy, the Kim-Kim-Suzuki treatment of interfaces is employed. Simulation results show how alloy composition, lattice misfit, external stress, temperature and time affect precipitate microstructure and variant selection during isothermal aging, without any a priori assumptions about key microstructural features including size, shape, volume fraction and spatial distribution of different types of precipitates and different variants of the same precipitate phase. The shapes of precipitates and their coarsening kinetics are analyzed based on the two-dimensional moment invariant. The various multiphase microstructures generated by the simulations have been used as model inputs in a study to investigate how precipitate microstructure (in particular shape and spatial distribution) influences the strength of IN718.

TI The effect of grain boundaries on high temperature oxidation of new

SO CORROSION SCIENCE
AB Isothermal oxidation in air was carried out on a gamma'-strengthened single crystalline Co-Al-W-B superalloy at 800, 900, and 1000 degrees C. The absence of grain boundaries leads to inferior oxidation properties at 800 and 900 degrees C, and improved properties at 1000 degrees C, compared to a polycrystalline alloy of the same composition. At lower temperatures, grain boundary diffusion is dominant and assumed to be the reason for enhanced B-accumulation in the inner oxide layer and enhanced formation of the protective inner Al2O3 layer. However, at 1000 degrees C superior oxidation resistance of the single crystalline superalloy can be observed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A series of candidate alumina-forming austenitic (AFA) stainless steels designed to evaluate the effects of variation in Al, C, Cr, Mn, Nb, and Ni content on high-temperature tensile properties, creep, and oxidation/corrosion resistance were studied. The compositions assessed were based on medium Ni (20-25 wt%) and low Ni (12 wt%) AFA variations strengthened primarily by MC and/or M23C6 carbide precipitates, and a high Ni (32 wt%) AFA superalloy variation strengthened primarily by gamma '-Ni3Al intermetallic precipitates. Tensile and creep properties were measured at 650 and 750/760 degrees C, oxidation resistance from 650 to 900 C in air with water vapor and steam environments, and sulfidation-oxidation resistance in Ar-20%H-2-20%H-2(O)-5% H2S at 550 and 650 degrees C. Optimized composition ranges for different use temperatures ranges based on these evaluations are presented. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The investigation has been performed for the superalloy after standard heat treatment and the ex-service CMSX-4 turbine blade after operation for 12 700 hours and 200 starts in industrial gas turbine. The results have shown that Co, Cr and Re partition to the gamma matrix, Ni and W are present in both gamma and gamma' phases, while Al, Ti and Ta strongly partition to the gamma' phase.

AB MCrA1Y alloys (where M stands for Ni,Co or both) are commonly used as overlay protective coatings in gas turbine engine components against high temperature oxidation and corrosion. The protective effect of these alloys is due to the formation of a continuous thermally stable oxide layer on the coating surface. In this work several types of MCrA1Y alloys, differing in their elemental composition, have been deposited on austenitic stainless steel by means of laser cladding. The microstructure of the coatings have been characterized by SEM-EDS and XRD. As expected, elemental composition compatible with gamma Ni/gamma' Ni3A1, gamma Ni/beta-NiAl or gamma Co/beta-(Co,Ni)A1 phases are observed in hypoeutectic or hypereutectic microstructures depending on the alloy composition. The high temperature oxidation behavior of the coatings was evaluated by air furnace oxidation tests at 1100 degrees C for 200 h. The oxidized surface of the samples was examined by SEM-EDS and the oxides present identified by theoretical stoichiometric calculations. Results indicate the formation of a uniform A1(3)O(2) protective oxide scale with NiO, CoO, Y2O3/YA1O(3) and Cr2O3 oxide inclusions.

AB Superalloys Nimonic 80A is a wrought nickel base alloy (min. 65 % Ni) and chromium (20 %), with minor additions of carbon, cobalt and iron, as well as major alloying elements of aluminum (1 to 1,8%) and titanium (1,8 to 2,7 %). Chemical composition of the alloy Nimonic 80A has a dominant influence on its mechanical and technological properties. Increasing of the temperature also has a large influence on the mechanical properties of superalloy Nimonic 80A
   Investigations which were carried out have included chemical testing and testing of mechanical properties of superalloy Nimonic 80A at room and higher temperatures. Regression analysis was done on the base of chemical analyses and results of mechanical properties. The results of regression analysis are equations by which on the basis of known chemical composition, ie content of main alloying elements Al, Ti and Co, the mechanical properties of materials at room and higher temperatures can be predicted.

AB Cast NiCrAl alloys with additions of Y, La, Hf and Ti were evaluated at 1100 degrees C in wet (10 and 50% H2O) and dry air (0% H2O) in order to optimize such dopants for superalloy bond coatings. The results suggest that the typical Y addition in most coatings could be replaced by La. Also, scale adhesion in cyclic testing was improved with the co-addition of Hf with La or Y. Ti was added to investigate its incorporation in coatings on superalloys containing significant Ti additions. Particularly with co-doped alloys, the addition of Ti had little effect on scale adhesion but did reduce the depth of internal oxidation. Water vapor increased spallation, especially for the least adherent alloys, such as Y,Ti-doped NiCrAl. For the co-doped compositions with Hf, water vapor had a limited effect on scale adhesion and on the alumina growth rate in isothermal exposures. In addition to specimen mass change, the extent of internal oxidation and the depletion of beta phase in the substrate were evaluated. Analytical transmission electron microscopy showed that Y, La and Hf co-segregated to the alumina scale grain boundaries and formed dopant-rich oxide precipitates in the scale.

SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB This study focuses on investigating the microstructure and oxidation behavior of Al and Hf co-deposition diffusion coatings deposited by Pt electroplating followed by combined aluminizing and hafnizing using the pack cementation technique. The composition (in wt.%) of the packs was 2NiAl-2NH(4)Cl-xHf-(96 - x)Al2O3 with different Hf levels (x = 2, 6, 12 and 16), and the corresponding microstructure of the coatings was gamma-Ni + gamma'-Ni3Al, NiAl + Al16Hf6Ni7, Al16Hf6Ni7 and Al1.65HfNi0.35, respectively. In the post heat-treatment process, with Hf and Al diffusing towards the superalloy substrate and Ni diffusing in the opposite direction, Al16Hf6Ni7 and Al1.65HfNi0.35 were transformed into Ni3Al + Al3HfNi12 and NiAl + Al3HfNi12, respectively. The isothermal oxidation tests at 1000 degrees C in air indicated that the coating formed in the packs containing 2 wt.% Hf had the lowest weight gain, while the weight gain of the coating formed in the packs having 6 wt.% Hf was the largest. The mechanisms of Hf-rich phase formation and their effects on oxidation resistance of the coatings were discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CERAMIC SOCIETY
AB Lanthanum hexaaluminate is a promising competitor to establish yttria partially stabilized zirconia as a thermal barrier coating material for Ni-based superalloy due to its relative low intrinsic thermal conductivity and low sinterability at temperatures exceeding 1100 degrees C. Sr2+ and Ti4+ were selected as two dopants to partially substitute the La3+ and Al3+ in LaMgAl11O19, respectively. The variation in thermal conductivity with Sr2+ and Ti4+ fractions was analyzed based on structure information provided by X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. The average crystal size of LaMgAl11O19 sintered at 1600 degrees C for 10min by spark plasma sintering is in nanoscale. The fully dense La1xSrxMgAl11xTixO19 solid solution showed a minimum thermal conductivity value (=1.12W/(mK)1,T=1273K) at the composition of La0.5Sr0.5MgAl10.5Ti0.5O19,which possibly reduces from the enhanced phonon scattering due to mass and strain fluctuations at the Ln3+ and B3+ sites.

AB Atom-probe tomography (APT) is utilized to investigate, in a Co-9.7Al-10.8W at.% alloy aged at 900 degrees C for similar to 1000 h, the phase compositions and partitioning behavior of the two-phase gamma(face-centered cubic)/gamma'(L1(2)) microstructure. The APT composition of the gamma-matrix (Co-8.97Al-5.69W at.%) agrees well with a previously reported measurement made by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy; however, the composition of the gamma'(L1(2)) precipitates (Co-10.03Al-12.48W at.%) is slightly richer in W and Al, and leaner in Co. Partitioning coefficients and Al interfacial excesses are also calculated. (c) 2012 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Synthesis and properties of open-cell Ni-Cr-Fe-Al alloy foams by pack
   co-deposition process
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY
AB A pack cementation process for the co-deposition of Cr, Fe and Al onto open-cell nickel foam was developed. The reticulated open-cell Ni-Cr-Fe-Al foams were annealed to homogenize the material with 18.8 wt.% Cr, 11.3 wt.% Fe and 7.7 wt.% Al. The microstructure and phase composition of the Ni-Cr-Fe-Al foams were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). X-ray diffraction (XRD) and energy dispersive analysis (EDS). The results show that the coating is uniform and dense along the perimeter of the Ni strut, and consists of three layers: a Cr-Fe outer layer, an inner layer containing mostly Al and a transition zone. After homogenization annealing, the alloyed foams retain the hollow struts structure of the original pure nickel foams and the low relative densities. The Ni-Cr-Fe-Al alloy foams exhibit enhancement in absolute strength as compared to the pure nickel and Ni-35.2Cr foams. Furthermore, the Ni-Cr-Fe-Al alloy foams show excellent oxidation resistance and outperform the chromia-forming Ni-35.2Cr alloy foam after oxidation,it 900 and 1000 degrees C, which is mainly due to its high aluminum and chromium content leading to the formation of a continuous and adherent duplex oxide layer.

TI Microstructural Characterization of Co-Based ODS Alloys
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING AND PERFORMANCE
AB Co-based ODS alloys, strengthened by nanosized oxide dispersion and gamma' precipitates, are potential high-temperature structural materials. The characteristics of the mechanically alloyed powder and the microstructural evolution of the Co-based ODS alloys were investigated. The results revealed that mechanical alloying had induced the formation of supersaturated solid solution in immiscible Co-Al-W-based alloys, originating mainly from extensive grain boundary region, high dislocation density, and ample point defect. Chemical compositions of mechanically alloyed Co-Al-W-based ODS alloys easily deviate from the gamma/gamma' two-phase region, leading to the existence of Al (x) Co, Co3W, Co7W6, and W phases in addition to the gamma and gamma' phases. Nonuniform distribution of alloying elements brings about the differences in morphologies and sizes of gamma' precipitates. Microstructural formation process is impelled by spinodal decomposition mode, and spinodal decomposition behavior has been accelerated in the fine-grained alloy because of the presence of short-circuited diffusion paths for atomic movement.

TI Cyclic Oxidation Behavior of an EB-PVD CoCrAlY Coating Influenced by
   Substrate/coating Interdiffusion
SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF AERONAUTICS
AB To reveal the influence of substrate/coating interdiffusion on the cyclic oxidation property of a metallic coating, cyclic oxidation behavior of an EB-PVD CoCrAlY coating on directionally solidified Ni-based superalloy DZ125 at 1 050 degrees C is investigated. The 40 mu m thick CoCrAlY coating has a cyclic oxidation life of around 160 h, and the oxidation constant is 1.915x10(-7) mg(4).cm(-8).s(-1). However, severe spallation of the oxides containing Co, Cr, Ni, Ta and Ti occurs with longer cyclic oxidation. The degradation in oxidation resistance for the coating is related to the depletion of Al due to the oxide spallation and interdiffusion. Severe interdiffusion between the coating and underlying substrate occurs at 1 050 degrees C. The composition of the substrate has an important effect on the thermal cycling lifetime of the coating. The influencing mechanism is discussed.

TI Electrochemical characterisation of novel gamma/gamma '-strengthened
   Co-base superalloys
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB Electrochemical behaviour of a new gamma/gamma'-strengthened Co-base superalloy with the composition Co-9Al-9W-0.12B (in at%) was studied in comparison with pure Co at room temperature in 1 M Na2SO4 (pH 5.9) and 0.1 M NaOH (pH 12.8) aqueous solutions. Pure Co and the Co-base superalloy show passive behaviour in both solutions. Impedance spectra measured at the corrosion potential indicate comparable impedance values for the alloy and pure Co in neutral solution, but in alkaline solution the alloy shows a lower corrosion rate. Polarisation curves indicate a limited range of passivity for both materials in neutral solution. In alkaline solution, the alloy and pure Co show similar (albeit not identical) primary and secondary ranges of passivity, as previously described in the literature for pure Co. Furthermore, lower passive current densities are observed for the superalloy in the primary range of passivity. As the superalloy studied in this work is a promising material for high temperature applications, we moreover compared the corrosion behaviour of oxidised alloy surfaces with the bare alloy surface. For this, isothermal oxidation of the gamma/gamma'-strengthened Co-base superalloy was carried out in air at 800 degrees C and 900 degrees C for 24 h and 500 h. Compared to unoxidised Co-Al-W-B alloys and pure Co samples, the high temperature oxide scales provide orders of magnitude higher protection with good barrier properties in a potential range between -1 and +2V (vs. Ag/AgCl). In general, longer oxidation times and a higher oxidation temperature result in the formation of more protective oxide layers. The protective effect of the high temperature oxide layers is discussed in view of their thickness and chemical composition. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Influence of composition on microstructural parameters of single crystal
   nickel-base superalloys
SO MATERIALS CHARACTERIZATION
AB Fourteen nickel-base superalloy single crystals containing a range of chromium (Cr), cobalt (Co), molybdenum (Mo), and rhenium (Re) levels, and fixed amounts of aluminum (Al) and tantalum (Ta), were examined to determine the effect of bulk composition on basic microstructural parameters, including gamma' solvus, gamma' volume fraction, topologically close-packed (TCP) phases, gamma and gamma' phase chemistries, and gamma-gamma' lattice mismatch. Regression models describing the influence of bulk alloy composition on each of the microstructural parameters were developed and compared to predictions by a commercially-available software tool that used computational thermodynamics Co produced the largest change in gamma' solvus over the wide compositional range explored and Mo produced the biggest effect on the gamma lattice parameter over its range, although Re had a very potent influence on all naicrostructural parameters investigated. Changing the Cr, Co, Mo, and Re contents in the bulk alloy had an impact on their concentrations in they gamma matrix and to a smaller extent in the gamma' phase. The software tool under-predicted gamma' solvus temperatures and gamma' volume fractions, and over-predicted TCP phase volume fractions at 982 degrees C. However, the statistical regression models provided excellent estimations of the microstructural parameters and demonstrated the usefulness of such fummlas. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

TI INFLUENCE OF SEGREGATION ON LIQUID DENSITY IN THE MUSHY ZONE OF DZ483
   Ni-BASED SUPERALLOY
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB Ni-based superalloys have been widely applied in advanced aeroengine as gas turbine blades and vanes. The freckles in superalloys formed during directional solidification have deleterious influence on the properties of the alloys. The generation of freckles is associated with the local liquid density gradient in the mushy zone, which is obviously influenced by microsegregation of alloy elements. However, the individual contributions of the various elements to the total density variation are still not well known. Therefore, the effect of microsegregation on the liquid density variation in DZ483 Ni-based superalloy was investigated by isothermal solidification together with liquid quench method. Solidification microstructures were observed by optical microscope and SEM, and the compositions of the solids and the residual liquid were determined by EDS. Based on the compositions of residual liquids; the densities of liquids at different temperatures were calculated. The results show that the onset solidification temperature of DZ483 alloy is a little bit below 1335 degrees C; and MC, which is enriched with Ta and Ti, formed at about 1325 degrees C. The segregation coefficients of different elements show that W and Co are negative segregation elements, Ta and Ti positive segregation elements, while Al and Cr show little segregation. The density of the residual liquid generally decreases as the decrease of temperature, with the exception that it increases somewhat from 1325 to 1315 degrees C. Calculation results show that temperature has insignificant influence on liquid density, and variation of density is mainly due to rnicrosegregation. Segregations of Mo and Ta lead to the increase of density, but segregations of Ti and W present opposite effect. Contribution of each element to the variation of the liquid density is analyzed. The sequence of contributions of alloy elements to the variation of total liquid density is Ti>Ta>W>Cr>Mo>Al>Co. The formation of MC consumes an abundant of Ti and Ta, resulting in the increase of liquid density from 1325 to 1315 degrees C.

TI OPTIMIZATION OF THE MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF THE SUPERALLOY NIMONIC 80A
SO MATERIALI IN TEHNOLOGIJE
AB The superalloy Nimonic 80A has found its major application in the production of the parts for the vehicle and airplane industries. It is a relatively expensive material and it is very important to reduce its production costs to acceptable levels. The aim of this research was to produce the superalloys with varying supplements of alloying elements.
   The investigations carried out included chemical testing and the testing of the mechanical properties of the superalloy Nimonic 80A, followed by a regression analysis of the obtained data to show the influence of certain alloying elements that can significantly affect the improvement of the mechanical properties of Nimonic 80A.
   The results of the regression analysis are the equations with which, on the basis of the known chemical composition, i.e., the content of the main alloying elements - Al, Ti and Co - the mechanical properties of the materials at increased temperatures can be predicted. On the basis of the obtained squared regression equations, an optimization of the chemical composition for the selected values of the mechanical properties was carried out.

TI Interdiffusion and Growth of the Phases in CoNi/Mo and CoNi/W Systems
SO METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND
   MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Deleterious topological-closed-packed (tcp) phases grow in the interdiffusion zone in turbine blades mainly because of the addition of refractory elements such as Mo and W in the Ni- and Co-based superalloys. CoNi/Mo and CoNi/W diffusion couples are prepared to understand the growth mechanism of the phases in the interdiffusion zone. Instead of determining the main and cross-interdiffusion coefficients following the conventional method, we preferred to determine the average effective interdiffusion coefficients of two elements after fixing the composition of one element more or less the same in the interdiffusion zone. These parameters can be directly related to the growth kinetics of the phases and shed light on the atomic mechanism of diffusion. In both systems, the diffusion rate of elements and the phase layer thickness increased because of the addition of Ni in the solid solution phase, probably because of an increase in driving force. On the other hand, the growth rate of the mu phase and the diffusion coefficient of the species decreased because of the addition of Ni. This indicates the change in defect concentration, which assists diffusion. Further, we revisited the previously published Co-Ni-Mo and Co-Ni-W ternary phase diagrams and compared them with the composition range of the phases developed in the interdiffusion zone. Different composition ranges of the tcp phases are found, and corrected phase diagrams are shown. The outcome of this study will help to optimize the concentration of elements in superalloys to control the growth of the tcp phases.

TI PARTITION OF Hf AMONG THE PHASES AND ITS EFFECTS ON PRECIPITATES IN PM

SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB The partition behavior of hafnium among different phases in FGH97 PM (powder metallurgy) superalloy and its effects on the precipitation behaviors of MC carbide and gamma' phase were studied by means of 3DAP, SEM, TEM and physiochemical phase analysis. The results showed that element Hf mainly exists in gamma' phase and MC carbide, which makes gamma' composition transform to (Ni,Co)(3)(Al, Ti, Nb, Hf), also makes MC transform to (Nb, Ti, Hf)C. With Hf addition increasing, the proportion of Hf in gamma' maintains constant, but in MC carbide increases and in gamma decreases, which means that partition ratio (R-1) between gamma' phase and MC carbide is decreased, while partition ratio (R-2) between gamma' phase and gamma matrix is increased, the average partition ratio between gamma' phase and MC carbide is about 1 : 0.1, and the average partition ratio between gamma' phase and gamma matrix is about 1 : 0.05. Hf is helpful to the precipitations of gamma' phase and MC carbide, the morphology and size of gamma' phase are influenced more by Hf than these of MC carbide.

CY SEP 09-13, 2012
CL Seven Springs, PA

AB In advanced industrial gas-turbine systems, there is a great demand for a new, excellent superalloy which can be used for large gas-turbine blades. Because it is very difficult to produce a large-scale Ni-based Single Crystal (SC) blade, we have developed new Directionally Solidified (DS) superalloys with an excellent combination of high-temperature creep strength, low-cycle-fatigue strength, good oxidation resistance, castability and hot-corrosion resistance. In this study, three kinds of Ni-based DS superalloys were designed with the aid of the d-electrons concept. The chemical compositions of these alloys were in the range of 1.4%Ti, 8.2%Cr, 11%Co, (0-1.0)%Ru, 3.6%Ta, 9.2%W, 1.0%Re, 5.2%Al, 1.40%Hf and balanced Ni in weight percent (wt%). Creep rupture tests, hot-corrosion burner-rig tests, low-cyclefatigue tests and oxidation tests were conducted with heat-treated DS specimens of these alloys. Two of the designed alloys showed the same level of creep rupture life as those of the 2nd generation DS superalloys currently in wide use. Oxidation tests at 1313K proved that the oxidation resistance of all the designed alloys was superior to that of all the reference alloys. The results of the hot-corrosion burner-rig tests showed that all the designed alloys had better corrosion resistance than the 2nd generation DS superalloys. As for Low-Cycle-Fatigue (LCF) strength, it was found that even 0.6%Ru addition greatly improved LCF strength, and the 0.6%Ru containing Alloy-B showed better LCF strength than any commercially used reference DS superalloys. A casting test was accomplished in a model bucket of a first stage blade of a 25MW-class gas turbine.
   Alloy-B is potentially a suitable alloy for making gas turbine blades with prolonged lifetimes and low maintenance costs in recent 1500 degrees C-class or even higher class gas turbines for power generation.

AB One type of functionally graded coating system is thermal barrier coating (TBC), where the combination of ceramic and metallic coating is used both to reduce the temperature and to increase oxidation and corrosion resistance of the substrate. TBCs usually consist of the top ceramic coating based on YSZ (ZrO2+Y2O3) and the metallic bond coating of M-CrAlY type, where M means Ni, Co or their appropriate combination. Electron beam physical vapour deposition (EB-PVD) or vacuum (VPS), low pressure (LPPS) or atmospheric (APS) plasma spraying techniques are most frequently used as a deposition method. Despite some requirements on the product shape simplicity, the air plasma spraying offers high productivity, sufficient quality and much lower production costs in comparison with the EB-PVD technology. The contribution deals with high temperature structural stability of TBCs of YSZ + NiCrAlY and YSZ + CoNiCrAlY types that were produced by air plasma spraying on the INCONEL 713LC polycrystalline nickel based superalloy substrate. Immediately after deposition, the specimens were exposed to temperature of 1000 C for 5-500 hours in the common ambient atmosphere. The changes in both microstructure and chemical composition were studied by means of scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive microanalysis and image analysis methods.

AB Nb is one of the common refractory elements added in Ni, Co and Fe based superalloys. This lead to the formation of brittle topological close packed (tcp) mu phase, which is deleterious to the structure. It mainly grows by interdiffusion and in the present article, the interdiffusion process in different Nb-X (X=Ni, Co, Fe) systems is discussed. The activation energy for interdiffusion is lower in the Co-Nb system (173 kJ/mol) than Fe-Nb system (233 kJ/mol), which is again lower than the value found in the Ni-Nb system (319.7 kJ/mol). The mole fraction of Nb in this phase is less than Fe or Co at stoichiometric compositions in the Nb-Fe (that is Fe7Nb6) and Nb-Co (that is Co7Nb6) systems. On the other hand, the mole fraction of Nb is higher than Ni in the same phase (Ni6Nb2) in Ni-Nb system. However, in all the phases, Nb has lower diffusion rate. Possible diffusion mechanism in this phase is discussed with respect to the crystal structure.

A small amount of oxide scale spallation happened during the oxidation at 950 degrees C. The analysis of the specimens after oxidized at 950 degrees C revealed that three oxide layers formed, including the outer layer consisting of TiO2 and CrTiO3, the middle layer consisting of Cr2O3, Ni(Cr2O4) and TiO2 phases, and internal oxidizing layers identified as Al2O3 phase (C) 2011 Published Elsevier Ltd.

The results show that the contents of Cr, Co, Mo and W mainly influence the precipitation temperature and amount of TCP and gamma' phases in Rene104. The suggested contents of Cr and Co are 13% and 20.6% respectively, and the suggested content of Mo is higher than W. The results also show that the content ratios of Al/Ti and Nb/Ta affect the precipitation behaviours of TCP and gamma' phases. The balance values of Al/Ti and Nb/Ta are suggested in order to make the alloy having desired microstructural stability and strengthening effect. In addition, Hf also influenced the precipitation behaviours of TCP and gamma' phases and the suggested content of Hf is 0.2%. The main precipitates of the new type P/M turbine disk superalloy FGH98I are gamma', MC, M23C6 and M3B2, and no any TCP phases precipitate. After the exposure at 750 degrees C, 815 degrees C and 850 degrees C for 1000 h, the new alloy still shows good microstructural stability.(C) 2011 Published Elsevier Ltd.

AB The low pressure plasma spraying (LPPS) method was used to prepare NiCoCrAlTaY bond coating on a nickel base superalloy with the composition(wt, %) of C 0.13-0.22, Cr 8.50-9.50, Co 9.0-11.0, Mo 2.50-3.50, Al 4.80-5.70, Ti 4.10-4.70, Fe <= 1.0, V 0.60-0.90, and Ni in balance. The thermal corrosion tests, including Isothermal and cycle oxidation, were conducted for the specimens of the base alloy and the alloy with coatings. The experimental results showed that the thermal spraying NiCoCrAlTaY bond coating improved the thermal corrosion resistance of the alloy significantly. It has been found that the base alloy had high weight gain of 68.91 g/m(2) at the test condition of 1100 degrees C for 100 hrs, while the weightl gain of the specimens of the alloy with NiCoCrAlTaY bond coating, was only 0.76 similar to 5.72 g/m(2). And the slight weight loss appeared when the specimen with with NiCoCrAlTaY bond coating was treated for 40 hrs at1100 degrees C The results also showed that the addition of tantalum element in the coating was beneficial for the thermal oxidation resistance. It has been found that after oxidation at 1100 degrees C for 100 hrs, the continued Al2O3 film nuderneath the outside layer mixture oxides of Cr, Ni, Al and Co, was formed on the substrate surface after both the isothermal oxidation and cycling oxidation. The coating has a good combination with the nickel base superalloy substrate. (C) 2011 Published Elsevier Ltd.

TI The effects of boron addition on the microstructure and mechanical
   properties of Co-Re-based high-temperature alloys
SO SCRIPTA MATERIALIA
AB High-melting-point Co-Re-base alloys show promise as a new class of high-temperature material. However, polycrystalline alloys fracture intergranularly. The addition of boron changes the fracture mode and dramatically improves the strength and ductility. Cr(2)B-type borides form at grain boundaries even with 200 ppm B addition in a Co-17Re-23Cr alloy. Borides are not, however, present at all grain boundaries, and electron energy loss spectroscopy could not detect elemental B segregation at grain boundaries. Measurements of boron mapping by neutron-induced radiography indicates that segregation of B to grain boundaries occurs, though only in some Co-Re alloy compositions. (C) 2011 Acta Materialia Inc.

TI The development of new bond coat compositions for thermal barrier
   coating systems operating under industrial gas turbine conditions
SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB Environmental and economic issues are driving the development of increasingly efficient gas turbines. An important step in achieving this is to engineer components which can operate with longer lifetimes and at higher metal temperatures. Inlet temperatures for gas turbines now exceed the melting temperatures of nickel-based superalloys (i.e. 1300-1350 degrees C). The use of advanced air cooling systems coupled with thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) reduces the temperature of the underlying superalloy substrate. The bond coating, an important part of the TBC system, oxidizes to form a slow growing protective oxide layer, while also providing adhesion between the ceramic topcoat and the substrate. NiCoCrAlY overlay coatings are some of the most commonly used bond coatings for industrial gas turbines and extensive research has been undertaken over many years to find the best bond coating composition.
   This paper reports upon the production of new, model bond coatings with a wide range of different compositions. The focus is on their oxidation behavior at a temperature typically experienced by bond coatings on industrial turbine blades (950 degrees C). A physical vapor deposition technique, magnetron sputtering, has been used to deposit a range of Ni-Co-Cr-Al coatings onto 10 mm diameter sapphire substrates. This was achieved through co-sputtering two targets: a Ni-10%Cr, Ni-20%Cr, Ni-50%Cr, Ni-20%Co-40%Cr or Ni-40%Co-20%Cr target and a pure Al target. About a hundred samples with varying compositions were produced by this method. The coatings were then oxidized in air for 500 h at 950 degrees C.
   All samples were assessed by measuring the change in coating thickness, using pre- and post-exposure metrology only, and also the change in specimen weight. This approach has shown that magnetron sputtering successfully deposited 20 to 30 mu m thick coatings and allowed the calculation of oxide growth rates. Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis was used to characterize the exact composition of each sample. Additionally, Xray diffraction (XRD) has been used to identify the major oxides formed during exposure. The selective growth of protective Cr2O3 or Al2O3 or other less protective mixed oxides (depending on the initial coating composition) was observed. This influenced the oxide scale growth rate, indicating which coatings produced more protective oxides and allowing future optimization of the bond coating composition, for service within the turbine section of industrial gas turbines to be planned.

TI Influence of cooling rate on the development of multiple generations of
   gamma ' precipitates in a commercial nickel base superalloy
SO MATERIALS CHARACTERIZATION
AB The compositional and microstructural evolution of different generations of gamma' precipitates during the continuous cooling of a commercial nickel base superalloy, Rene88DT, has been characterized by three dimensional atom probe tomography coupled with energy-filtered transmission electron microscopy studies. After solutionizing in the single gamma phase field, continuous cooling at a very high rate results in a monomodal size distribution of gamma' precipitates with a high nucleation density and non-equilibrium compositions. In contrast, a relatively slower cooling rate (similar to 24 degrees C/min) results in a multi-modal size distribution of gamma' precipitates with he larger first generation primary precipitates exhibiting close to equilibrium composition, along with the smaller scale secondary gamma' precipitates, exhibiting non-equilibrium composition (excess of Co and Cr, depleted in Al and Ti). The composition of the gamma matrix near these precipitates also exhibits similar trends with the composition being closer to equilibrium near the primary precipitates as compared to the secondary precipitates.

AB The gamma/gamma' microstructure of a Re-containing Ni-based single crystal super alloy after a two-step aging was studied using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). The crystals were grown by the floating zone (FZ) method. Both cuboidal and spherical gamma' precipitates were formed after a two-step aging. The size of the cuboidal gamma' phases first increased and then decreased with the extension of the second-step aging time.

TI Thermomechanical Fatigue Damage Evolution in a Superalloy/Thermal
   Barrier System Containing a Circular Through Hole
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CERAMIC SOCIETY
AB The results of an investigation of thermomechanical fatigue (TMF) on a superalloy specimen, with an applied thermal barrier coating (TBC) and a circular through hole, are presented. Tensile loads were applied in phase with increasing temperature. Damage evolution in the form of cracks develops in the TBC adjacent to the hole. These cracks run perpendicular to the loading axis. Stress mapping of the thermally grown oxide (TGO) using luminescence spectroscopy determined an increase in compressive residual stress with increasing TMF cycling. Scanning electron microscopy examination, following cross sectioning, determined the TBC cracks to be vertical separations of the columnar yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) top coat. Microscopic damage mechanisms in the form of plasticity (bending of YSZ columns) and TGO cracking were observed. Imperfections in the bond coat are associated with these vertical separations. Energy-dispersive element mapping of these imperfections indicated a composition of alumina and mixed Cr, Co, and Ni oxides.

TI Single-crystal solidification of new Co-Al-W-base alloys
SO INTERMETALLICS
AB Solidification processing of new high-temperature Co-Al-W-base single-crystals has been investigated. Single-crystal bars with compositions of Co-9.4Al-10.7W, Co-8.8Al-9.8W-2Ta and Co-7.8Al-7.8W -1.5Ta-4.5Cr (at%) were successfully grown with a conventional Bridgman process. Helical grain selectors resulted in [001] dendritic growth with primary dendrite arm spacings in the range of 278 -364 mu m. Segregation of constituent elements in the dendritic structure was very limited, compared to Ni-base single-crystals. Concentration profiles obtained by electron microprobe and analyzed via the Scheil equation indicate distribution coefficients for Co, Al, W and Cr that are close to 1. The distribution coefficient of Ta was approximately 0.6, indicating preferential segregation to the liquid during solidification. These observations collectively suggest that convective instabilities and freckle formation are unlikely to occur during solidification of single-crystals of this new class of high strength Co-Al-W-base alloys.

The integrated diffusion coefficients at different temperatures are calculated for the Nb2Co7 phase, which has very narrow composition range. The interdiffusion coefficients at different compositions in the NbCo2 Laves phase are determined. The interdiffusion coefficient in this phase decreases with increasing Nb content to the stoichiometric composition. Further, the average interdiffusion coefficient in the N6Co7-mu phase is determined. The activation energies for diffusion in different phases are calculated, providing valuable information regarding the diffusion mechanism. In addition, an experiment using Kirkendall markers is conducted to calculate the relative mobilities of the species.

CY MAY 25-28, 2010
CL Wildbad Kreuth, GERMANY
AB Fourth generation superalloys are characterised by the addition of Ru which contributes to improved creep resistance whilst improving the microstructural stability. However, Ru additions have a negative effect on coated Ni-base superalloys, promoting Secondary Reaction Zone (SRZ) formation. Formation of a layer of SRZ beneath an aluminised or Pt-aluminised coating has the potential to reduce the effective cross section of a blade by in excess of 100 gm or 10% of the wall thickness. In this paper the effects of alloy composition on the formation of the SRZ in Pt-Aluminised fourth generation alloys were investigated systematically. A series of experimental fourth generation alloys was used having two distinct compositions of Co, Mo, W and Ru and conforming to a four factorial 'Design of Experiments' model. These alloys showed significant and consistent changes in the SRZ depending on alloy composition. These were in distinct contrast to the effects of these elements on stability in the bulk. Mo was demonstrated to be by far the most effective element suppressing SRZ formation, followed by Co. In contrast, both W and Ru enhance SRZ formation.

AB Laser cladding has been taken into consideration for repairing K418 Ni-based superalloy material with CoCrNiW powder. Composition of cladding materials was revealed by energy dispersive X-ray spectrum(EDS). The characteristic microstructure of the cladding layer and interface were investigated by using an optical microscope and scanning electron microscope(SEM). Cladding coatings were obtained for different process parameters, and a detailed study of the effects of these parameters has been carried out by SEM. Metallurgical bonding between the cladding layer and substrate materials was obtained. Effect of heat input on cladding cracking susceptibility has been studied to obtain optimum condition for crack-free welds. Variations in cracking susceptibility as a function of heat input is discussed with reference to metallurgical characteristics of the clads. The corresponding microstructure induced by different heat input was discussed in this paper too.

SO JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING FOR GAS TURBINES AND POWER-TRANSACTIONS OF THE
   ASME
AB Both aviation and land based turbine components such as vanes/nozzles, combustion chambers, liners, and transition pieces often degrade and crack in service. Rather than replacing with new components, innovative repairs can help reduce overhaul and maintenance costs. These components are cast from either Co-based solid solution superalloys such as FSX-414, or Ni-based gamma prime precipitation strengthened superalloys such as IN738. The nominal compositions of FSX-414 and IN738 are Co-29.5Cr-10.5Ni-7W-2Fe (max)-0.25C-0.012B and Ni-0.001B-0.17C-8.5Co-16Cr-1.7Mo-3.4Al-2.6W-1.7Ta-2Nb-3.4Ti-0.1Zr, respectively. Diffusion brazing has been used for over 4 decades to repair cracks and degradation on these types of components. Typically, braze materials utilized for component repairs are Ni and Co-based braze fillers containing B and/or Si as melting point depressants. Especially when repairing wide cracks typically found on industrial gas turbine components, these melting point depressants can form brittle intermetallic boride and silicide phases that effect mechanical properties such as low cycle and thermal fatigue. The objective of this work is to investigate and evaluate the use of hypereutectic Ni-Cr-Hf and Ni-Cr-Zr braze filler metals, where the melting point depressant is no longer B, but Hf and/or Zr. Typically, with joint gaps or crack widths less than 0.15 mm, the braze filler metal alone can be utilized. For cracks greater than 0.15 mm, a superalloy powder is mixed with the braze filler metal to enable wide cracks to be successfully braze repaired. As a means of qualifying the diffusion braze repair, both metallurgical and mechanical property evaluations were carried out. The metallurgical evaluation consisted of optical and scanning electron microscopy, and microprobe analysis. The diffusion brazed area consisted of a fine-grained equiaxed structure, with carbide phases, gamma (gamma) dendrites, flower shaped/rosette gamma-gamma' (gamma-gamma prime) eutectic phases and Ni(7)Hf(2), Ni(5)HF, or Ni(5)Zr intermetallic phases dispersed both intergranularly and intragranularly. Hardness tests showed that the Ni-Hf and Ni-Zr intermetallic phase only has a hardness range of 250-400 Hv; whereas, the typical Cr-boride phases have hardness ranges from 800 Hv to 1000 Hv. Therefore, the hardness values of the Ni-Hf and Ni-Zr intermetallic phases are 2.5-3.2 times softer than the Cr-boride intermetallic phases. As a result, the low cycle fatigue (LCF) properties of the wide gap Ni-Cr-Hf and Ni-Cr-Zr brazed joints are superior to those of the Ni-Cr-B braze filler metals. The mechanical property evaluations were tensile tests at both room temperature and elevated temperature, stress rupture tests from 760 degrees C to 1093 degrees C and finally LCF, the latter being one of the most important and severe tests to conduct, since the cracks being repaired are thermal fatigue driven. At the optimum braze thermal cycle, the mechanical test results achieved were a minimum of 80% and sometimes equivalent to that of the base metals properties.

The objective of this work is to investigate and evaluate the use of hypereutectic Ni-Cr-Hf and Ni-Cr-Zr braze filler metals, where the melting point depressant is no longer B, but Hf and/or Zr. Typically, with joint gaps or crack widths less than 0.15 mm, the braze filler metal alone can be utilized. For cracks greater than 0.15 mm, a superalloy powder is mixed with the braze filler metal to enable wide cracks to be successfully brazed repaired. As a means of qualifying the diffusion braze repair, both metallurgical and mechanical property evaluations were carried out. The metallurgical evaluation consisted of optical and scanning electron microscopies, and microprobe analysis. The diffusion brazed area consisted of a fine-grained equiaxed structure with carbide phases, gamma (gamma) dendrites, flower shaped/rosette gamma-gamma prime (gamma-gamma(')) eutectic phases, and Ni(7)Hf(2), Ni(5)HF, or Ni(5)Zr intermetallic phases dispersed both intergranularly and intragranularly. Hardness tests showed that the Ni-Hf and Ni-Zr intermetallic phase only has a hardness range of 250-400 HV, whereas, the typical Cr-boride phases have hardness ranges from 800 HV to 1000 HV. Therefore the hardness values of the Ni-Hf and Ni-Zr intermetallic phases are 2.5-3.2 times softer than the Cr-boride intermetallic phases. As a result the low cycle fatigue (LCF) properties of the wide gap Ni-Cr-Hf and Ni-Cr-Zr brazed joints are superior to those of the Ni-Cr-B braze filler metals. The mechanical property evaluations were tensile tests at both room temperature and elevated temperature, stress rupture test from 760 degrees C to 1093 degrees C, and finally LCF tests, the latter being one of the most important and severe tests to conduct since the cracks being repaired are thermal fatigue driven. At the optimum braze thermal cycle, the mechanical test results achieved were a minimum of 80% and sometimes equivalent to that of the base metal properties.

TI Study on 3d-Shell Electrons and Bond Configuration in Ni-Co-Cr
   Superalloys by Positron Annihilation Spectroscopy
SO RARE METAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING
AB Doppler-broadening spectra of positron annihilation radiation for pure metals Ni, Co and Cr and Ni-Co-Cr alloys with three different chemical compositions were measured by 2-detector coincidence technique. And the effect of the 3d electrons on Ni-Co-Cr alloy formation was analyzed. The results show that the 3d electron signal for the metal Ni is relatively higher among the three pure metals. The increase of Ni atom proportion in Ni-Co-Cr alloys leads to an increase in the probability of positron annihilation with free electrons. The experimental ratio curves for three Ni-Co-Cr alloys are greatly similar to the corresponding theoretic ratio curves, which indicate that the bonding nature in Ni-Co-Cr alloys is mainly metallic. This can explain why the Ni-Co-Cr alloys have good metal ductility.

TI THERMODYNAMIC STUDY ON EQUILIBRIUM PRECIPITATION PHASES IN A NOVEL Ni-Co
   BASE SUPERALLOY
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB Thermodynamic properties of the traditional U720Li alloy and the new Ni-Co base superalloy have been studied using JMatPro and the latest relevant database for Ni base superalloys. The effects of chemical composition on the equilibrium precipitation phases, process-ability and gamma/gamma' mismatch have been analyzed. It is found that the gamma/gamma' mismatch increases with the increase of Ti/Al (atomic ratio). The volume fraction of gamma' is proportional to the Ti+Al contents (atomic fraction). Therefore, by increasing the Ti/Al ratio and Ti+Al content, the yield strength of alloys can be improved. On the other hand, the gamma' solvus temperature decreases by Co additions. As a result, the range of processing temperature is extended. The gamma/gamma' mismatch also increases with Co additions, which adds additional strengthening to the alloy. Moreover, high Ti/Al ratio or low Co content promotes the precipitation of eta phase. Thus, Ni-Co base superalloys with high Ti+Al content, Ti/Al ratio and Co content bear an improved strength, phase stabilities and process-ability.

AB For exploring the possibility of a. hybrid mode With smooth transition from fluid to boundary even to solid lubrication at the elevated temperature, i.e., searching a substance which should be the solid lubricant. and oil additive with environmentally friendly. characters; a Series of perrhenates (the soft double oxide) were synthesized as the candidates because of their crystalline and decomposed products with a good anti-friction behaviour, such a Re2O7 which might provide the lubrication during Oil decomposition for its good sublimation kit about. 300 degrees C. This investigation might, be advantage of lubrication for rubbing part's of internal combustion or turbo engine such as piston ring and cylinder liner or exchanger; which were always operated in a. cyclical variation of temperature (even to 800 degrees C).
   In this paper, the properties of perrhenates of Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Pb, Ca, Ba and La synthesized by aqua-solution method were described and their crystalline structures, compositions and morphologies were determined by XRD, SEM-EDS For understanding their lubricating behaviors in both dry sliding base oil pentaerythritol ester (PETE), their lubricating behaviors between Si3N4 ball and superalloy disc were tested in pin-on-disc Oil universal micro-tribotester (UMT-2) from 20 to 750 degrees C. The results show that most synthesized perrhenates ale crystal powder except the synthesized gel-like ferric perrhenate, their crystalline structures are coincidence with powder diffraction file (PDF) cards, and compositions are very close to the stoichiometic values Some of the synthesized perrhenates exhibit certain lubrication at 300-750 degrees C, in both dry sliding and oil lubrication With addition of the synthesized perrhenate which were verified in reciprocating sliding The variation of friction coefficients temperature probably results from the formation or removal of soft oxides at, high temperature The good anti-frictional behaviors of the synthesized perrhenates of Ca, Co and Cu in a, wide temperature range seem to imply. them to be developed as the candidates of additive in a hybrid lubricating mode for the engine operating in cyclical variation of temperature.

The present work shows the ability of the Spark Plasma Sintering technique to rapidly develop new coatings compositions and microstructures. This technique allows combining powders and metallic foils on a superalloy substrate in order to obtain multilayered coatings in a single short production step. Fabrication of MCrAlY overlays with local Pt and/or Al enrichments is shown, as well as fabrication of coatings made of zeta-PtAl2, epsilon-PtAl, alpha-AlNiPt2, martensitic and beta-(Ni,Pt)Al or Pt-rich gamma/gamma' phases, including their doping with reactive elements. The fabrication of a complete TBC system with a porous and adherent Yttria Stabilized Zirconia (YSZ) layer on a bond-coating is also demonstrated, as well as the fabrication of a CoNiCrAlY-based cermet coating for abradable seal application. Difficulties of fabrication are reviewed, such as Y segregation, risks of carburization, local over-heating, or difficulty to coat complex shaped parts. Solutions are given to overcome these difficulties.

AB The compositional and microstructural evolution of different generations of precipitates of the ordered gamma' phase during the continuous cooling, followed by isothermal aging, of a commercial nickel-base superalloy, Rene 88DT, has been characterized by three-dimensional atom probe (3DAP) tomography coupled with energy-filtered transmission electron microscopy (EFTEM) Studies. After solutionizing in the single gamma-phase field, during continuous cooling at a relatively slow rate (-24 degrees C/min), the first-generation primary gamma' precipitates, Forming at relatively higher temperatures, exhibit near-equilibrium compositions, while the smaller-scale secondary gamma' precipitates, forming at lower temperatures, exhibit nonequilibrium compositions often containing an excess of Co and Cr while being depleted in Al and Ti content. The compositions of the gamma matrix near these precipitates also exhibit similar trends, with the composition being closer to equilibrium near the primary precipitates as compared to the secondary precipitates. Subsequent isothermal aging at 760 degrees C leads to coarsening of the primary gamma' precipitates without affecting their composition significantly. In contrast, the composition of the secondary gamma' precipitates is driven toward equilibrium during the isothermal aging process.

TI Wetting and interfacial behavior of Ni-Si alloy on different substrates
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Wetting of molten Ni-56 at.% Si alloy on different substrates (SiC ceramic, Ni- and Co-based superalloys, Kovar, and Mo) are performed under different experimental conditions by the sessile drop technique. Temperature, atmosphere, and substrate composition play the key roles in determining the wettability, the spreading characteristics, and the interfacial morphology of the final interfaces. The non-reactive wetting characteristics in Ni-Si/SiC system are confirmed, with a spreading rate increasing with temperature increasing. In the Ni-Si/metal systems the spreading process is determined by the competition between spreading along the substrate surface and the interfacial interactions. Excellent wettability and fast spreading are found in the Ni-Si/Co-based superalloy, Ni-Si/Kovar, and Ni-Si/Mo systems at both the temperatures (1100 and 1200 A degrees C). These results can be used as a reference guide for joining SiC to these metallic components, or to itself, using the Ni-Si alloy as filler metal.

SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB In order to meet the requirements of marine gas turbine blade materials, a, new-type directional solidification Ni-based superalloy named DZ68 was developed. The alloy composition was designed by low segregation technology. Its nominal chemical composition (mass fraction, %) is C 0.05, Cr 12.0, Mo 1.0, W 5.0, Co 8.5, Al 5.3, Ti 0.5, Ta 5.0, Re 2.0, B 0.01, and balance is Ni. The microstructures of as-east DZ68 alloy and after heat treatment states were analyzed by OM, SEM and XRD. The tensile, rupture and hot corrosion resistance properties of DZ68 alloy were compared with DZ125 and IN738 alloys. Results show that the microstructure of as-cast DZ68 alloy is composed of gamma, gamma', (gamma+gamma') eutectics, MC type carbides and a few borides. After heat treatment, the microstructure of DZ68 alloy is composed of gamma, gamma' and carbides. The carbides are mainly MC and M23C6. The tensile strength of DZ68 alloy decreases slightly with the increase of temperature, and reaches its minimum value at 700 degrees C. When the temperature is higher than 700 degrees C, the tensile strength increases so evidently that reaches its maximum at once at 760 degrees C, But when the temperature is higher than 760 degrees C its tensile strength decreases obviously. It is well recognized the relationship of the tensile strength of DZ68 alloy with temperature is abnormal, similar to that of its yield strength but opposite to that of its plasticity. The tensile and rupture properties of DZ68 alloy are nearly the same as those of DZ125 alloy and its hot corrosion resistance property is nearly the same as that of IN738 alloy under the same conditions.

TI CHARACTERISTIC AND FORMATION MECHANISM OF PRECIPITATES AT
   RECRYSTALLIZATION GRAIN BOUNDARIES OF SINGLE CRYSTAL SUPERALLOY DD6
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB Single crystal superalloys have extremely good elevated temperature capability in advanced gas turbine aero engines due to no highly stressed grain boundaries in them. With the removal of grain boundary strengthening elements such as C, B and Zr, the occurrence of recrystallization may be detrimental to their performance. Therefore, recrystallization becomes critical in industrial manufacture of single crystal superalloy blades. In the present study, specimens of single crystal superalloy DD6 were grit blasted, solution treated and aged at vacuum atmosphere, and then the precipitates at recrystallization grain boundaries were investigated by SEM, TEM, EPMA and Thermo-Calc. The results show that a few of M6C carbides precipitate at recrystallization grain boundaries, and their size is about 0.5 mu m. These M6C carbides are rich in W, Re and Mo, but poor in Al, Ta, Ni, the contents of Cr, Nb, Co in them are almost the same as the nominal composition of DD6 alloy. The carbon accumulation at recrystallization boundaries and combination with mu phase forming elements such as W and Mo restrain the p, phase forming. M23C6 phase hardly forms in DD6 alloy due to its high W and low Cr content.

SO JOURNAL OF THE KOREAN INSTITUTE OF METALS AND MATERIALS
AB Co base superalloys have been widely used for the parts of gas turbine due to their excellent strength, thermal fatigue, oxidation resistance and weldability at high temperature. In this study, directional solidifications were carried out at various solidification rates, including 0.5 similar to 300 mu m/s in the Co base superalloy FSX-414. The cellular interface were formed at a low solidification rate, 1 mu m/s, and the dendritic interface was found at higher solidification rates, 5 similar to 300 mu m/s. As the spacing of dendrite structure decreased, the size and spacing of eutectics decreased. Dendrite arm spacing decreased with increasing solidification rates and temperature gradient. It was interesting to find the M23C6 eutectic microstructure formed between gamma dendrites. Composition analysis showed that Cr and W were segregated severely between the dendrites, which resulted in the formation of Cr-rich M23C6 and W-rich MC carbides.

AB The oxidation behaviour of model Co-Re based alloys at 1000 degrees C in air has been investigated. Thermogravimetric studies in combination with microstructural examinations of Co-Re alloys with different compositions showed the negative influence on the oxidation resistance of Co based alloys due to the evaporation of rhenium oxide(s). Oxidation at 1000 degrees C in air yielded an oxide scale, which consists of a Co oxide outer layer on a thick and porous mixed Co-Cr oxide and a semicontinuous and therefore non-protective Cr oxide film on the base metal substrate. This allows the vaporisation of rhenium oxide formed during oxidation and leads to a loss of Re. In addition, computer aided thermodynamic calculations were carried out to supplement the experimental analyses.

AB Both aviation and land based turbine components such as vanes/nozzles, combustion chambers, liners, and transition pieces often degrade and crack in service. Rather than replacing with new components, innovative repairs can help reduce overhaul and maintenance costs. These components are cast from either Co-based solid solution superalloys such as FSX-414, or Ni-based gamma prime precipitation strengthened superalloys such as IN738. The nominal compositions of FSX-414 and IN738 are Co-29.5Cr-10.5N1-7W-2Fe [max]-0.25C-0.012B and Ni-0.001B -0.17C-8.5Co-16Cr-1.7Mo-3.4Al-2.6W-1.7Ta-2Nb-3.4Ti-0.1Zr, respectively.
   Diffusion brazing has been used for over four decades to repair cracks and degradation on these types of components. Typically, braze materials utilized for component repairs are Ni and Co-based braze fillers containing B and/or Si as melting point depressants. Especially when repairing wide cracks typically found on industrial gas turbine components, these melting point depressants can form brittle intermetallic boride and silicide phases that effect mechanical properties such as low cycle and thermal fatigue. The objective of this work is to investigate and evaluate the use of hyper-eutectic Ni-Cr-Hf and Ni-Cr-Zr braze filler metals, where the melting point depressant is no longer B, but Hf and/or Zr. Typically, with joint gaps or crack widths less than 0.15mm, the braze filler metal alone can be utilized. For cracks greater than 0.15mm, a superalloy powder is mixed with the braze filler metal to enable wide cracks to be successfully braze repaired. As a means of qualifying the diffusion braze repair, both metallurgical and mechanical property evaluations were carried out. The metallurgical evaluation consisted of optical and scanning electron microscopy, and microprobe analysis. The diffusion brazed area consisted of a fine-grained equiaxed structure, with carbide phases, gamma [gamma] dendrites, flower shaped/rosette gamma-gamma' [gamma-gamma prime] eutectic phases and Ni(7)Hf(2), Ni(5)HF, or Ni(5)Zr intermetallic phases dispersed both intergranularly and intragranularly. Hardness tests showed that the Ni-Hf and Ni-Zr intermetallic phase only has a hardness range of 250Hv to 400Hv; whereas, the typical Cr-boride phases have hardness ranges from 800Hv to 1000Hv Therefore the hardness values of the Ni-Hf and Ni-Zr intermetallic phases are 2.5-3.2 times softer than the Cr-boride intermetallic phases. As a result the LCF properties of the wide gap Ni-Cr-Hf and Ni-Cr-Zr brazed joints are superior to those of the Ni-Cr-B braze filler metals. The mechanical property evaluations were tensile tests at both room temperature and elevated temperature, stress rupture tests from 760 degrees C-1093 degrees C and finally low cycle fatigue [LCF] tests, the latter being one of the most important and severe tests to conduct, since the cracks being repaired are thermal fatigue driven. At the optimum braze thermal cycle, the mechanical test results achieved were a minimum of 80% and sometimes equivalent to that of the base metals properties.

AB The time dependent degradation of first-stage blades for gas turbine was investigated. First, Two used blades were prepared from the operating facilities, and their operating hours were 25,000 and 52,000 hrs, respectively. Microstructural comparison of coating surfaces showed that exposure to the environment increased thickness of TGO (Thermally Grown Oxide) and beta depletion region, and then debonding and spallation of TBC (Thermal Barrier Coating) occurred finally. In the case of substrate, Ni-based superalloy, the shape and size of gamma' were changed with increasing operating time. Especially, in the leading and trailing edges of blades, the size of gamma' was bigger and the shape was more elliptic than other region. It can be thought that the leading and trailing edges of blades can be the starting point of degradation in first-stage blades. Second, TBC failed blade used for 22,000 hrs was prepared and compared with other two blades. Large interfacial cracks were formed between top and bond coat, and TGO was not uniform and continuous. The chemical composition analysis on bond coat showed that low chromium content is responsible for the formation not only of Al oxide but also of Co, Cr, Ni oxides.

TI Investigations on role of HVOF sprayed Co and Ni based coatings to

SO CORROSION ENGINEERING SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB This paper aims to investigate the hot corrosion resistance of high velocity oxy-fuel (HVOF) sprayed cobalt based (Stellite-6) and nickel based (Ni-20Cr) coatings deposited on the superalloy Superni-718 (Ni-19Cr-18.5Fe-5.13Ta-3.05Mo-0.9Ti-0.5Al-0.18Mn-0.18Si-0.15Cu0.04C) in the Na(2)SO(4)-60%V(2)O(5) salt environment at 900 degrees C under cyclic conditions. The X-ray diffractometry, scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive analysis and electron probe microanalyser techniques were used to study the corrosion products with respect to their morphology, phase composition and element concentration. The thermogravimetric technique was used to establish the kinetics of corrosion. The bare alloy underwent severe hot corrosion attack. The Ni-20Cr coating shows excellent hot corrosion resistance with negligible spallation, whereas Stellite-6 coating reveals less hot corrosion resistance and more spallation. The hot corrosion resistance of Ni-20Cr coating has been attributed to the formation of oxides of chromium, nickel and spinel of nickel chromium. The oxides of silicon, chromium, cobalt and spinels of cobalt-chromium and nickel-chromium have contributed for hot corrosion resistance of Stellite-6 coatings.

   elements on gamma/gamma ' interface
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB A first-principles approach is proposed to investigate the partitioning behaviors of the alloying elements Re, Co, and Cr, and the influence of Ru and Ir addition on them. The results show that Re, Co, and Cr all partition strongly to the gamma matrix. The Ru addition decreases the gamma phase partitioning trend of Re, Co, and Cr. The results are consistent with the early experimental work. Besides Ru, Ir results in Re less strongly partitioning to gamma. Our study shows that the influence of Ru (or Ir) on the partitioning characteristics of alloying elements originates from the strong interactions between Ru(Ir)-Re-Ni through the d-d orbitals hybridization.

SO METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND
   MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Mechanisms of creep deformation in nickel-base superalloy single crystals in the directional coarsening regime have been studied in alloys with large variations in gamma-gamma ' lattice misfit and phase composition, achieved by Ru additions and variable levels of Cr and Co. Interfacial dislocation spacings established by long-term annealing experiments under no externally applied stress indicate that the experimental alloys have high-temperature lattice misfits ranging from near-zero to as large as -0.65 pct. Variation in misfit influences the stress-induced directional coarsening (rafting) behavior during creep deformation at 950 circle C and 290 MPa. In postcreep deformed material, the density of excess dislocations (defined as the dislocations beyond those necessary to relieve the lattice misfit) at the gamma-gamma degrees interfaces varied with alloy composition, with the most creep-resistant, alloy containing the highest excess interfacial dislocation density. In the directional coarsening creep regime, continued deformation requires shearing of the gamma ' rafts and is strongly influenced by the resistance of the precipitates to shearing as well as the interfacial dislocation structure. A preliminary model for creep in the rafting regime is developed.

AB Both aviation and land based turbine components such as vanes/nozzles, combustion chambers, liners, and transition pieces often degrade and crack in service. Rather than replacing with new components, innovative repairs can help reduce overhaul and maintenance costs. These components are cast from either Co-based solid solution superalloys such as FSX-414, or Ni-based gamma prime precipitation strengthened superalloys such as IN738. The nominal compositions of FSX-414 and IN738 are Co-29.5Cr-10.5Ni-7W-2Fe [max]-0.25C-0.012B and Ni-0.001B -0.17C-8.5Co-16Cr-1.7Mo-3.4Al-2.6W-1.7Ta-2Nb-3.4Ti-0.1Zr, respectively.
   Diffusion brazing has been used for over four decades to repair cracks and degradation on these types of components. Typically, braze materials utilized for component repairs are Ni and Co-based braze fillers containing B and/or Si as melting point depressants. Especially when repairing wide cracks typically found on industrial gas turbine components, these melting point depressants can form brittle intermetallic boride and silicide phases that effect mechanical properties such as low cycle and thermal fatigue. The objective of this work is to investigate and evaluate the use of hyper-eutectic Ni-Cr-Hf and Ni-Cr-Zr braze filler metals, where the melting point depressant is no longer B, but Hf and/or Zr. Typically, With joint gaps or crack widths less than 0.15mm, the braze filler metal alone can be utilized. For cracks greater than 0.15mm, a superalloy powder is mixed with the braze filler metal to enable wide cracks to be successfully brazed repaired. As a means of qualifying the diffusion braze repair, both metallurgical and mechanical property evaluations were carried out. The metallurgical evaluation consisted of optical and scanning electron microscopy, and microprobe analysis. The diffusion brazed area consisted of a fine-grained equiaxed structure, with carbide phases, gamma [gamma] dendrites, flower shaped/rosette gamma-gamma' [gamma-gamma prime] eutectic phases and Ni(7)Hf(2), Ni(5)HF, or Ni(5)Zr intermetallic phases dispersed both intergranularly and intragranularly. Hardness tests showed that the Ni-Hf and Ni-Zr intermetallic phase only has a hardness range of 250Hv to 400Hv; whereas, the typical Cr-boride phases have hardness ranges from 800Hv to 1000Hv. Therefore the hardness values of the Ni-HF and Ni-Zr intermetallic phases are 2.5-3.2 times softer than the Cr-boride intermetallic phases. As a result the LCF properties of the wide gap Ni-Cr-Hf and Ni-Cr-Zr brazed joints are superior to those of the Ni-Cr-B braze filler metals.

AB Four turbine blades having a nominal B-1900 composition were submitted for failure analysis after cracks were detected or Z-notch failure had occurred at the shroud. The blades were weld repaired at the shroud edges and returned to service, only to fail after several hours. The blade repairs involved machining away the original material, and then inert gas tungsten arc weld repairing with a Co-base hardface and B-1900 filler alloy. Analysis of the broken blades found that they had failed from fatigue. This fatigue was the result of cracks in the heat-affected zones of the blades created from liquation at the grain boundaries and residual stresses that could not be relieved through the low-ductility weldments. Cracks also developed from precipitation of brittle secondary phases at the coating-weldment interdiffusion zone.

AB The 1150 degrees C oxidation behavior of gamma + gamma'-based alloys containing up to 20 at.% Pt and 15-22 at.% Al was investigated in an effort to further develop and optimize alternative bond coating compositions for advanced thermal barrier coating systems. It was found that the co-addition of Pt and Hf was extremely beneficial to oxidation resistance, to the extent that Ni-20Al-20Pt-Hf and Ni-20Al-10Pt-Hf alloys oxidized at significantly slower rates than a Ni-50Al-15Pt beta-NiAl alloy. Moreover it was found that there is an optimum Hf content that depends on Pt content in the alloy. A feasible method to deposit Pt + Hf-modified gamma + gamma' coatings having overall compositions closely approaching those targeted (Ni-Al15-20-Pt15-20-Hf) on the basis of the bulk-alloy study was subsequently developed. Cyclic oxidation testing of a representative gamma + gamma' coating at 1150 degrees C in air revealed the absence of surface rumpling and excellent compatibility with the superalloy substrate as major advantages compared to traditional Pt-modified beta-NiAl coatings.

AB Nanostructural features of nickel-base superalloys as revealed by atom probe field ion microscopy (APFIM) and atom probe tomography (APT) are reviewed. The more salient information provided by these techniques is discussed through an almost exhaustive analysis of literature over the last 30 years. Atom probe techniques are shown to be able to measure the composition of tiny gamma' precipitates, a few nanometers in size, and to reveal chemical order within these precipitates. Phase separation kinetics in model NiCrAl alloys was investigated with both 3DAP and Monte-Carlo simulation. Results are shown to be in good agreement. Plane by plane analysis of {001} planes of Ni3Al-type gamma' phase makes it possible to estimate the degree of order as well as the preferential sites of various addition elements (Ti, Cr, Co, W, Ta, Re, Ru, etc.) included in superalloys. Clustering effects of Re in the gamma solid solution were also exhibited. Due to its ultrahigh depth resolution, the microchemistry of interfaces and grain boundaries can be characterized on an atomic scale. Grain boundaries in Astroloy or N18 superalloys were found to be enriched in B, Mo, and Cr and Al depleted.

TI Life-time determining spalling mechanisms of NiCoCrAlRE/EB-PVD zirconia
   TBC systems
SO MATERIALWISSENSCHAFT UND WERKSTOFFTECHNIK
AB The mechanisms that control the lifetime of thermal barrier coating (TBC) systems have been traced by two particular overlay bondcoats serving as model systems: superalloy pins (IN100, CMSX-4) with two alternative NiCoCrAlRE (RE: Hf, Y) bond coat compositions (i) NiCoCrAlY without and (ii) with co-dopants of silicon and hafnium. On top an electron-beam physical-vapor deposited (EB-PVD) yttria partially stabilized zirconia (YPSZ) TBC commonly mixed with 2 wt.% hafnia, or, rarely with 10 wt.%, was applied. The test pins were thermo-cycled at 1100 and 1150 degrees C until failure. Identical lifetimes in cyclic tests on YPSZ TBCs with 2 (relatively high sintering rate) and 10 wt.% hafnia (relatively low sintering rate) preclude an effect of diffusion mechanisms of the YPSZ TBC on lifetime. The fit of lifetimes and test temperatures to Arrhenius-type relationships gives activation energies for failure. These energies agree with the activation energies for anion and cation diffusion in alumina for the respective bondcoat variant:
   (i) for the NiCoCrAlY/TBC system for O-2- diffusion in alumina,
   (ii) for the NiCoCrAlYSiHf/TBC system for Al3+ diffusion in alumina. SEM and EDS investigations of the thermally grown oxides (TGOs) confirm the mechanisms responsible for TBC failure.as indicated by activation energies. Two categories of failure can be distinguished: (i) NiCoCrAlY coatings fail by an "adhesive mode of failure" along smooth bond coat/TGO interfaces driven by a critical TGO thickness. (ii) NiCoCrAlYSiHf coatings fail later and more reluctantly by a "cohesive" crack mode via de-cohesion at the TGO/TBC interface. In the latter case a quasi-integrity of the crack-affected TGO is lengthily maintained U to failure by a crack-pinning mechanism which runs via Al(3+)psupply from the bondcoat.

AB The microstructure of a newly developed Co-base superalloy with enhanced high-temperature strength has been investigated using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and three-dimensional atom probe (3DAP) techniques. It mainly consists of a typical gamma/gamma' (FCC/L1(2)) structure and a plate-shaped AB(3)-type (Ni, Co, Cr)(3)(Ti, Al) intermetallic compound with hexagonal structure (a similar to 5.1 angstrom and c similar to 12.5 angstrom). gamma' is formed with a bimodal distribution and fine gamma' has a cuboidal morphology. Cr and Co are enriched in the gamma phase, while Ti, Al and Ni are enriched in the gamma' phase. W and Mo are more or less uniformly distributed in both gamma and gamma'. Chemical composition analysis by 3DAP suggests that the plate-shaped phase has a higher Ti and lower Al content compared to that of gamma' phase, and the concentration of Ti, Co and Ni has a periodic variation along c-axis with a period of 12.5 angstrom in the plate-shaped phase.

The solute atoms considered include Al, Co, Cr, Hf, Mo, Nb, Re, Ru, Ta, Ti, and W. The calculations were performed using supercells with 1 solute atom and 107 solvent atoms. It is found that the atomic size difference, the electronic interactions, and the magnetic spin relations between the solute and solvent atoms all contribute to the lattice distortions. Based on the results from first-principles calculations, the linear composition coefficients of fcc Ni lattice parameter for different solutes were determined, and the lattice parameters of multicomponent Ni-base superalloys as a function of solute composition were predicted. The results are compared with existing experimental measurements, and good agreements are obtained for both the compositional dependence of lattice parameters and the local lattice distortions.

TI Oxidation resistance of Pt containing gamma-Ni+gamma '-Ni3Al alloys
SO JOURNAL OF THE JAPAN INSTITUTE OF METALS
AB The oxidation behavior of Pt + Hf-modified gamma-Ni+gamma'-Ni3Al alloys containing up to 20 at%Pt and either 15 or 20 a%Al was studied by oxidizing the alloys in air at 1150 degrees C under both isothermal and thermal cycling conditions. It was found that the co-addition of Pt and Hf was extremely beneficial to oxidation resistance, to the extent that Ni-20Al-20Pt-0.4Hf and Ni-20Al-10Pt0.4Hf alloys (all compositions are in at%) oxidized at significantly slower rates than that of a Ni-50Al-15Pt beta-NiAl alloy. A Ni-20A1-5Pt-0.3Hf alloy also showed relatively good oxidation resistance, with the oxidation rate being almost the same as that obtained for Ni-50Al-15Pt alloy. Over a period of up to 500 one-hour oxidation cycles, no oxide spallation from the modified gamma + gamma' alloys was observed. From cross-sectional SEM examination coupled with X-ray diffraction analyses, it was found that a compact and planar exclusive scale layer of alpha-Al2O3 formed on the Ni-20Al-20Pt-0.4Hf alloy. By contrast, Ni-20Al-10Pt-0.4Hf and Ni-20Al-5Pt-0.3Hf alloys formed a very thin outer layer of NiAl2O4 and a planar inner layer of of alpha-Al2O3. The thickness of this inner Al2O3 layer increased with increasing oxidation time relative to that of the NiAl2O4 layer, suggesting that the latter primarily formed during the initial stages of scale formation. Both NiO and NiAl2O4 were found in the outer scales formed on the Ni-20Al-0.3Hf and Ni-15Al-0 similar to 10Pt-M alloys, with the thickness of these oxide layers decreasing with increasing Pt content in the alloys. Further, it was found that the extent of internal HfO2 formation decreased significantly with increasing in Pt content, to the extent that no HfO2 was found in the oxidized Ni-20Al-20Pt-0.4Hf alloy. Inferences for the observed beneficial effects of Pt promoting protective Al2O3 formation and decreasing the tendency for Hf to oxidize in gamma + gamma' alloys will be presented.

AB In advanced industrial gas-turbine systems, there has been a great demand for new single crystal (SC) superalloys with an excellent combination of high-temperature creep strength, hot-corrosion resistance and oxidation resistance. In this study, 12 nickel-based SC superalloys were designed with the aid of the d-electrons concept. Their chemical compositions were in the range of 1.2-1.5%Ti, 3.8-6.5%Cr, 11%Co, 0-1.4%Mo, 0-3.0%Ru, 6.5-7.4%Ta, 5.0-6.4%W, 3.6-5.4%Re, 5.1-5.5%Al, 0.12-0.14%Hf and balanced Ni in wt%. A series of experiments such as creep rapture tests, burner rig tests and cyclic oxidation,tests were conducted with the heat-treated SC specimens of these alloys. Almost all the designed alloys were found to be superior in creep rupture life to a second generation superalloy currently used in the world. For hot-corrosion resistance, estimated from the burner rig tests, any of the designed alloys were comparable or even superior to a second generation superalloy. The. oxidation resistance was very different among the designed alloys, but some of them showed better resistance than the second generation superalloy. Thus the SC alloys containing about 4-5 wt%Re had about 30 degrees C or more higher temperature capability than the second generation superalloy, while exhibiting excellent hot-corrosion resistance and good oxidation resistance.

TI Studies of the metallurgical and mechanical properties of high velocity
   oxy-fuel sprayed stellite-6 coatings on Ni- and Fe-based superalloys
SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB High-velocity oxygen-fuel (HVOF) process is one of the most popular thermal spraying technologies and has been widely adopted by many industries due to its flexibility and the superior quality of coatings produced. This paper demonstrates the successful application of Stellite-6 metallic coatings on the Ni- and Fe-based superalloys by HVOF process for hot corrosion applications. The microstructure, porosity, coating thickness, phase formation and microhardness properties of the coatings were characterised using the combined techniques of optical microscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive analysis (SEM/EDAX) and electron probe microanalysis (EPMA). The coatings exhibited characteristic splatlike, layered morphologies due to the deposition and re-solidification of successive molten or semi-molten powder particles. The coating possesses porosity, unmelted and semimelted particles, and inclusions. The coatings have porosity less than 2% and hardness values in the range of 800-900 Hv. The as sprayed microstructure has a face centred cubic (fec) Co-rich metallic matrix with very small fraction of CoNiO2 spinet oxide. EDAX analysis of the coating microstructure confirmed that the coating composition is similar to the feedstock powder. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Microstructure of cobalt based alloy coatings produced by laser deposit

SO SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY OF WELDING AND JOINING
AB Coatings of cobalt based alloy HMSP 2528, deposited on a nickel based superalloy using a transverse flow CO2 laser, are investigated. Sections of the coatings have been examined to reveal their microstructure and phase composition using an Olympus PME - 3 type optical microscope, scanning electron microscope, transmission electron microscope, and X-ray diffractometer. The results showed that primary phase (gamma-Co) and eutectic (gamma-Co+Cr23C6) were present in the coatings. Rapid directional solidification was found at the interface, where the growth direction was perpendicular to the interface. Multidirectional growth and growth parallel to the scanning direction were also found in the central region and near the top surface, respectively. At the remelted boundary between two tracks, a novel microstructure was found in which the crystallisation direction of the first track was transmitted to the second track. As more tracks were deposited, coarsening dendrites could be found at the interfaces.

TI Microstructural evolution in a Ni-Cr-Co based superalloy during cooling
   from the melt
SO MATERIALS CHARACTERIZATION
AB In this study the composition of a Ni-Cr-Co based superalloy was modified with silicon additions in order to observe its effects on the microstructure. The evolution of the microstructure was investigated by electron microscopy of as-cast samples containing various amounts of Si ranging from 0.48 to 5.43 wt.%. The precipitated phases were identified through electron diffraction to be sigma (sigma), chi (chi), and M23C6. The sigma precipitates of blocky morphology appeared to enclose the precipitates of X phase. Lamellar regions consisting of sigma and M23C6 were observed to form along the boundaries between the sigma particles and the neighboring phases. These lamellar cells were observed to have grown into the intermetallic phases sigma and chi. A crystallographic relationship was also found to exist between the sigma and M23C6.

AB The influence of Co, W and Ti on stress-rupture lives of a Ni-Cr-Al-Mo-Ta-Co-W-Ti single crystal nickel-base superalloy has been investigated using a L-9 (3(4)) orthogonal array design (OAD) by statistical analysis. At a selected composition range, Ti content was the most important factor to the effect of the stress-rupture lives and then followed by Co content. W content had the minimum effect on stress-rupture lives. The optimal alloy should contain 10 wt pct Co, 8 wt pct W and zero Ti. The optimized alloy also had good microstructural stability during thermal exposure at 870 degrees C for 500 h.

TI Prediction of thermal mechanical fatigue properties of ni-base single
   crystal superalloys
SO JOURNAL OF THE JAPAN INSTITUTE OF METALS
AB This study was carried out to find out the mechanical properties of nickel-base superalloys that affect thermal mechanical fatigue (TMF). TMF tests and high temperature tensile tests were conducted on 28 of Ni-base single crystal superalloys in order to obtain mechanical property data. Based on the experimental data, Multiple regression analysis was performed for the correlation between the number of TMF cycles to failure and the alloy compositions. The multiple correlation coefficient was found to be R = 0.84; this indicates that alloy composition has a considerable relationship with the number of TMF cycles to failure. It was also found that the addition of Co, Ru and Al is effective to improve the TMF property. In addition, another multiple regression analysis was also carried out for the correlation between the number of TMF cycles to failure among high temperature mechanical properties and microstructural parameters.

TI Effect of nano-Y2O3 on microstructure of laser cladding cobalt-based
   alloy coatings
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB Cobalt-based alloy coatings with and without nano-Y2O3 particles produced by a 5 kW CO2 laser on Ni-based superalloy were introduced. Solidified microstructure, phase compositions and distribution of nano-particles were investigated by using optical microscope, SEM, TEM and XRD. The results showed that metastable phases, such as gamma-Co and Cr23C6 existed in cobalt-based alloy coatings. Another two phases (Y2O3 and epsilon-Co) were found by adding nano-Y2O3. Without nano-Y2O3, rapid directional solidified microstructure of columnar dendrite appeared. Fine and short dendritic microstructure and columnar to equiaxed transition (CET) occurred by adding nano-Y2O3 particles. With the increase in amount of nano-Y2O3, fully equiaxed crystallization appeared and the formation mechanism was analyzed. The results also showed that the sub-microstructure of the coatings changed from dislocation to stacking fault by adding nano-Y2O3. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Pre-oxidation of Inconel alloys for inhibition of carbon deposition from
   heated jet fuel
SO OXIDATION OF METALS
AB Exposure of superalloy surfaces to jet fuel at elevated temperatures leads to the formation of carbonaceous deposits and metal sulfides. The formation of stable oxide layers on alloy surfaces can reduce the activity of the constituent transition metals that catalyze the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons and the subsequent carbon deposit growth. The metals Ni, Cr, Fe, Mn, Al, Ti and Nb + Ta form thermodynamically stable oxide layers after oxidation above 800 degrees C under O-2 flow. In this study, we investigated the formation of oxides and spinels on three different Ni-base superalloys (Inconel 600, Inconel 718, and Inconel X750) and their activity towards carbon and sulfur deposit formation from jet fuel (JP-8) thermal stressing at 600 degrees C and 34 atm (500 psig) for 5 hr. Metal oxide formation during pre-oxidation and the behavior of pre-oxidized samples in thermal stressing were found to depend strongly on the minor element composition of these superalloys.

AB The oxidation behavior of Pt+Hf-modified gamma-Ni + gamma'-Ni(3)Al alloys containing up to 20 at.% Pt and either 15 or 20 at.% Al was studied by oxidizing the alloys in air at 1150 degrees C under both isothermal and thermal cycling conditions. It was found that the co-addition of Pt and Hf was extremely beneficial to oxidation resistance, to the extent that Ni-20Al-20Pt-Hf` and Ni-20Al-10Pt-Hf alloys (all compositions are in at.%) oxidized at significantly slower rates than that of a Ni-50Al-15Pt beta-NiAl alloy. A Ni-20Al-5Pt-Hf alloy also showed good oxidation resistance, with the steady-state oxidation rate being almost the same as that obtained for the beta alloy. Over a period of up to 500 one-hour oxidation cycles, no oxide spallation from the modified gamma+gamma' alloys was observed. From cross-sectional SEM examination coupled with X-ray diffraction analyses, it was found that a compact and planar exclusive scale layer of alpha-Al(2)O(3) formed on the Ni-20Al-20Pt-Hf alloy. By contrast, the Ni-20Al-10Pt-Hf and Ni-20Al-5Pt-Hf alloys formed a very thin outer layer of NiAl(2)O(4) and a planar inner layer of alpha-Al(2)O(3). The thickness of the inner Al(2)O(3) layer increased with increasing oxidation time relative to that of the NiAl(2)O(4) layer, meaning that the latter primarily formed during the initial stages of scale formation. Both NiO and NiAl(2)O(4) were found in the scales formed on the Ni-20Al-Hf and Ni-15Al-0 similar to 10Pt-Hf alloys, with the thickness of these oxide layers decreasing with increasing Pt content in the alloys. Further, it was found that the extent of internal HfO(2) formation decreased significantly with increasing Pt content, to the extent that no HfO(2) was found in the oxidized Ni-20Al-20Pt-Hf alloy. Inferences for the observed beneficial effects of Pt promoting protective Al(2)O(3) formation and decreasing the tendency for Hf to oxidize in gamma+gamma' alloys are discussed.

Interdiffusion behavior between the Pt-Ir films and substrates was investigated in terms of chemical composition, phase constitution and morphology. X-ray analysis revealed that annealed specimens consisted of several fcc solid solutioned phases with various lattice parameters, together with ordered intermetallic compounds (Ll(2)-(Pt,Ni)(3)Al and B2-(IrNi)Al), due to the inward diffusion of Pt and Ir from the electrodeposited films to the superalloy substrates, and the outward diffusion of solute elements (Ni, Al, Cr, Co) in the superalloy substrates into the films during annealing. The depth concentration analysis indicated that the Pt-36.1 Ir film effectively retarded the outward diffusion of solute elements, especially nickel, from the substrate.

TI Influence of surface treatment of bondcoat and yttrium in bondcoat on
   oxidation behavior of thermal barrier coatings
SO JOURNAL OF THE JAPAN INSTITUTE OF METALS
AB This paper focuses on the oxide layer formed at bondcoat/topcoat interface of thermal barrier coatings (TBCs), which grows faster in comparison with the oxide layer formed on overlay coatings, although both bondcoat and overlay coating are made of MCrAlY alloy (M is Ni or Co, or combination of Ni and Co). The authors clarify the influence of (D the surface treatment (shot peening) of bondcoat and (2) yttrium in bondcoat on the oxidation behavior of the thermal barrier coatings. Oxidation tests were carried out at 950 degrees C in air by means of TBC specimens. The specimen consists of Ni-base superalloy (Inconel738LC), CoNiCrAlY bondcoat and ZrO2-Y2O3 topcoat. In the TBC specimen with as-sprayed bondcoat, the oxide layer consisted of "wart-like oxide" and "continuous alumina layer". The wart-like oxide is caused due to un-melted particles of CoNiCrAlY alloy that remained at the bondcoat /topcoat interface in spraying process. The surface treatment of bondcoat prevented the formation of wart-like oxide because the unmelted particles were removed. In the TBC specimen with as-sprayed bondcoat, yttrium-rich oxide particles were included in the continuous alumina layer. The surface treatment of bondcoat and/or the removal of yttrium from the chemical composition of bondcoat in TBC specimen prevented the formation of the yttrium-rich oxide particles in the continuous oxide layer, and as a result, the growth of continuous alumina layer was decreased. There is a possibility that the application of the bondcoat without yttrium restrains the growth of the continuous oxide layer in TBC.

TI Research and Improvement on structure stability and corrosion resistance
   of nickel-base superalloy INCONEL alloy 740
SO MATERIALS & DESIGN
AB INCONEL alloy 740 is a newly developed Ni-Cr-Co-Mo-Nb-Ti-Al superalloy in the application to ultra-supercritical boilers with steam temperatures up to 700 degrees C. By means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), micro-chemical phase analyses, and corrosion-resisting test, this paper investigates the structure stability of the alloy at elevated temperature and concentrates on coal ash corrosion performance of the alloy under the simulated coal ash/ flue gas condition. Experimental results show that the most important structure instabilities of the alloy during prolonged aging are gamma' coarsening, gamma' to eta transformation and G phase formation at grain boundary. The performance of corrosion resistance of the alloy would meet the requirement of ultra-supercritical boiler tubes. The phase computation by means of Thermo-Calc has been adopted in chemical composition modification for structure stability improvement. Two suggested new modified alloys in adjustment of the Al and Ti contents and in control of Si level, and also in maintenance of Cr content of the alloy were designed and melted for experimental investigation. These two modified alloys exhibit more stable microstructure during 760 degrees C long time aging. (C) 2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, the characteristics of GH2984, including the chemical composition, mechanical and chemical properties, the microstructure stability after long-time thermal exposure and the processing property at hot and cold conditions have been introduced briefly. Then the superiority of this alloy used in ship boiler and ultra-supercritical coal-fired boiler as superheater was analyzed.

TI Creep strength of Co-free Ni-base single crystal superalloys
SO JOURNAL OF THE JAPAN INSTITUTE OF METALS
AB The Pebble Bed Modular Reactor (PBMR) is a small atomic power reactor which can be used in areas where the electric power transmission network is not well developed. It generates electricity by gas-turbines that used He-gas as a coolant. Ni-based superalloys are the primary materials used in gas-turbines. However if conventional Ni-base superalloys are to be used for PBMR, turbine maintenances will be difficult due to Co, as it can produce Co-60 a recitative material that possesses a long half-life. Therefore, Co-free Ni-base superalloys are required for PBMR.
   In this paper, a Co-free single-crystal (SC) superalloy, TMS-82 + (-Co), was developed; it was the same chemical composition as the 2(nd) generation SC superalloy, TMS-82+, except that it is Co-free creep tests were performed on the developed alloy, TMS-82 +, under three conditions; 900 degrees C/392 MPa, 1000 degrees C/245 MPa, and 1100 degrees C/137 MPa; CMSX-4, a popular SC alloy, was used as comparison.
   TMS-82 + (-Co) displayed superior creep-rupture life in all creep tests; however, detrimental TCP were observed in the microstructure of the sample that underwent creep testing at 1100 degrees C/137 MPa. This, the developed Co-free SC alloy should be further modified for long-term microstructural stability. Elimination of phase formation will allow the alloy to be utilized in the PBMR.

TI A thermodynamic model applicable to liquid gamma gamma prime phase
   equilibrium in superalloys
SO CANADIAN METALLURGICAL QUARTERLY
AB A thermodynamic model has been developed to address the gamma, gamma prime and liquid phase equilibrium for dilute single crystal gas turbine alloys such as CMSX-10. The model is based on a review of the Ni-X (X = Al, Co, Cr, Re, Ta, W) binary systems where the observed binary phase diagrams are well reproduced with self-consistent thermodynamic models that incorporate, when available, measured thermodynamic properties. These models are then interpolated using the Kohler scheme to address the gamma-gamma prime equilibrium observed in the related Al-Ni-X ternary systems. The gamma and liquid phases are modelled using a substitutional solution formalism; the gamma prime phase is modelled as the stoichiometric compound Ni3Al into which are dissolved compounds of the Ni3X type. The role of coherency in superalloy microstructure and the importance of a sound knowledge of constituent binary systems are discussed. The calculated phase equilibrium compositions and phase transformation temperatures are compared to the literature data for CMSX-10.

SO RARE METAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING
AB A new nickel-based superalloy was oxidized in air at 950degreesC and 1000degreesC for time up to 140 h. Its oxidation behaviors were investigated by means of TGA, XRD and SEM(EDX). The kinetic curve of alloy oxidized at 950degreesC for 128 h obeys the parabolic rate law and no oxide peels off. The parabolic law is almost followed when alloy is oxidized at 1 000degreesC. A small amount of oxide scale spallation happens in the course of oxidation at 1 000degreesC. The oxide scales consist of Cr2O3,(Ni,Co)Cr2O4, TiO2, SiO2 and Al2O3, and internal oxidation takes place both at 950degreesC and at 1 000degreesC. This new alloy exhibits higher resistance to oxidation at 950degreesC than that at 1 000degreesC. The oxidation mechanism of the alloy has also been suggested by the phase composition analyses of oxide layers.

AB The change of microstructure in an atmospheric plasma sprayed thermal barrier coating (APS-TBC) by isothermal heat exposure has been studied. Used 8 mass% Y2O2-ZrO2 TBC layer, a Ni-Co-Cr-Al-Y bond coat (BC) layer, and an IN738 superalloy substrate. The TBC system is subjected to heat exposure at 1423 K in ambient air for 10, 50, 100, 200, 300, and 400 h. Polished transverse sections of heat-exposed TBCs are examined and the changes of constitutes are discussed. Both sintering and cracking of the TBC layer are observed and these behaviors are strongly correlated with the morphology of as-sprayed intersplat boundaries and heat exposure time, respectively. A thermally grown oxide (TGO) layer is formed after heat exposure, and the thickness increases with the increase in heat exposure time. The chemical composition and morphology of the TGO layer depend on the heat exposure time. Micro-cracking in the TGO layer and TBC layer is observed after formation of a spinel, which is attributed to a lack of Al in the BC layer. The composition and phases in the BC layer are strongly correlated with the growth behavior of the TGO layer.

AB A new nickel-base superalloy Ni-25Cr-20Co-0.5Mo-2Nb-1.7Ti-0.8Al has just developed by Special Metals Corporation in the application to ultra-supercritical boilers with steam temperatures up to 700 degrees C. The structure stability of the alloy was studied in detail in combination of SEM, TEM, XRD and micro-chemical phase analyses. Experimental results show that the most important structure instability is as follows: 1) gamma' coarsening; 2) gamma' to eta transformation; 3) G phase formation. The phase computation by means of Thermo-Calc has been adopted in chemical composition modification for structure stability improvement. Two suggested new modified alloys in adjustment of the Al and Ti contents and in control of Si level were designed and melted for experimental study. These 2 modified new alloys exhibit more stable structure at 760 degrees C long time aging. A bright perspective has been shown for the development of this new alloy in the near future.

TI Microstructural changes as postmortem temperature indicator in
   Ni-Co-Cr-Al-Y oxidation protection coatings
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB Microstructural changes in a metallic oxidation protection coating (Ni-Co-Cr-Al-Y) applied on a nickel base superalloy were investigated by means of scanning and transmission electron microscopy. The changes are due either to thermal mechanical fatigue testing under high thermal gradients or to defined isothermal heat treatments. The coated specimens were quenched from temperatures between 840 and 1100degreesC to ambient temperature. The resultant phases, their local distribution and compositions were determined by energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy and electron diffraction. Phase equilibria at respective temperatures were determined by thermodynamic calculations based on the CALPHAD method. The calculated and experimentally determined phase distributions were compared. A particular microstructural feature, namely the existence and spatial distribution of spherical gamma' Ni3Al precipitates in the coating and the diffusion zone between substrate and coating, was used as a postmortem indicator for the maximum temperature experienced by the specimen during testing. This paper gives a road map for developing a microstructural-based temperature calibration for complex metallic materials using thermodynamic simulations. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Compositional design considerations for microsegregation in single

SO INTERMETALLICS
CT International Symposium on Intermetallic and Advanced Materials
CY MAR 02-06, 2003
CL San Diego, CA
AB This paper investigates the role of varying refractory addition levels on the microsegregation behaviour of single crystal (SX) superalloys systems during solidification. Specifically, a series of six Ni-base alloy compositions are set in a controlled manner, such that the chemical effects of Re, W, and Ru can be independently assessed. Each experimental alloy is produced in the SX condition utilizing a modified Bridgman casting process, with subsequent compositional analysis of the solidification structures via standard electron microprobe analysis (EPMA) methods. Qualitative partitioning results indicate typical SX alloy segregation behavior with elements such as Cr, Co, Re, Mo, and W all segregating towards the dendrite core regions, while the gamma' forming elements of Al, Ti, and Ta show favorable partitioning to the interdendritic gamma-gamma' eutectic regions. Both Ni and Ru exhibit ideal segregation behaviour with no favorable partitioning to either phase. Quantitative EPMA results indicate that as the nominal Re level increases, the severity of microsegregation to the dendrite core regions rises dramatically for Mo, Cr, and Re. Remarkably, evidence is presented demonstrating the role that Ru plays in counteracting the microsegregation effects of both increased Re and higher overall total refractory levels.

TI Development of Ni-based single crystal superalloys for power-generation
   gas-turbine blades
SO TETSU TO HAGANE-JOURNAL OF THE IRON AND STEEL INSTITUTE OF JAPAN
AB In advanced industrial gas-turbine systems, there has been a great demand for new single crystal (SC) superalloys with an excellent combination of high-temperature creep strength, hot-corrosion resistance and oxidation resistance. In this study, ten nickel-based SC superalloys were designed with the aid of the d-electrons concept. Their chemical compositions were in the range of 1.2-1.5% Ti, 3.8-6.5% Cr, 11% Co, 01.4% Mo, 6.5-7.4% Ta, 5.0-6.0% W, 3.6-5.4% Re, 5.1-5.5% Al, 0.12-0.14% Hf and balanced Ni in mass% units. A series of experiments such as creep rupture tests, burner rig tests and cyclic oxidation tests was conducted with the heat-treated SC specimens of these alloys. All the designed alloys were found to be superior in the creep rupture life to a second generation superalloy, CMSX-4. In the hot-corrosion resistance estimated from the burner rig tests, any designed alloys were comparable or even superior to CMSX-4. The oxidation resistance was very different amount the designed alloys, but some of them showed higher resistance than CMSX-4. Thus the SC alloys containing about 4-5 mass% Re had about 20 K higher temperature capability than CMSX-4, while exhibiting excellent hot-corrosion resistance and oxidation resistance.

TI Microstructure and wear resistance of laser clad cobalt-based alloy
   multi-layer coatings
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB Multi-layer Co-based alloy (HMSP 2537) were deposited on Ni-based superalloy plate with a TJ-TL-T5000 type CO2 laser. Sections of such coatings were examined to reveal their microstructure and phase composition using optical microscope, scanning electron microscope (SEM), and X-ray diffractometer (XRD). The hardness and wear resistance of the coatings were tested. The results showed that the prime phase (gamma-Co dendrite) and other phases, such as CrNi, Co7W6, and Cr23C6 existed in the coatings. Dendrite or cellular microstructures were observed perpendicular to the interface, and coarsening microstructures were obtained as more layers deposited. Dendrite paralleling to laser scan speed was also found near the top surface of the last layer. Fine microstructures of gamma-Co dendrite and lamellar eutectic in inter-dendritic regions strengthened the coatings. Microhardness and wear resistance of the coatings were much higher than that of substrate but slightly decreased with layers increased. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   between co-based hardfacing alloys and IN738Ni-based superalloy
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING AND PERFORMANCE
AB Alloy mixtures with varying composition of two Co-based hardfacing alloys and IN738 Ni-based super alloy were examined using differential scanning calorimetry. The microstructure of the resulting specimens was then analyzed using optical and scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy. The microstructural evolution between each bardfacing alloy and the IN738 substrate was documented and the formation of topologically close-packed and/or additional carbide phases was noted. Microstructures that are undesirable for high temperature and stress applications were produced in specimens with a higher degree of mixing (from 25 to 75 wt.% of hardfacing alloy in IN738). The two hardfacing alloys produced markedly different microstructures in the alloy mixtures due to differences in elemental composition. A hardfacing process that minimizes the degree of deposit-substrate mixing will be beneficial to the performance of the coating.

AB A low pressure plasma sprayed (LPPS) NiCoCrAlY aircraft turbine blade overlay coating was investigated by differential thermal analysis (DTA). A pronounced irreversible endothermic reaction peak was observed at 975 degreesC for the as-sprayed coating. No equivalent reaction is observed for the LPPS coating in the annealed state and in Ni-Co-Cr-Al (Ni:Co = 2:1) compositions after slow furnace cool-down as well. The reaction scheme for the partial ternary AlNi-Cr-Ni system was taken as a reference standard for understanding the irreversible reaction, and was reexamined where necessary. The four-phase solid state reaction in the ternary system at 995 degreesC, according to gamma-Ni + beta-NiAl --> gamma'-Ni3Al + alpha-Cr, is compared with the occurrence of the reaction observed at 975 degreesC on the as-sprayed NiCoCrAlY coating material. It runs most likely according to gamma-Ni + -gamma'-Ni(3)AI --> alpha-Cr + beta-NiAl. The reaction at 975 degreesC is discussed in terms of metastable phase formation sequences.

TI Formation of primary M6C carbide and its effect on cast die superalloys
   with high content of tungsten
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB Nickel based superalloys with high content of tungsten (W) have been applied to cast the large size die. Because the formation of large amount of primary M6C phase embrittles the die, it is necessary to explore the forming condition of primary M6C. The experiments prove that the alloys containing carbon content higher than 0.15% (mass fraction) tend to precipitate primary M6C carbide and 10% Co can restrict the formation of M6C effectively. The primary M6C forms at 1375 V. The cooling rate between the solid and liquid temperature range can influence the precipitation of this phase sensitively. Rapid cooling retard the formation of M6C obviously. The section size effect of the formation of M6C exists in castings. For a heavy section possessing dendrite spacing higher than 150 mum, it is very easy to form M6C with a millimeter magnitude, which damages the high temperature strength of alloys. To prevent the precipitation of M6C in large size section die, the composition of alloy is recommended to maintain at the level of 0.04%-0.07% C and 10%-15% Co.

The diffusion simulations use composition-dependent thermodynamic and diffusion quantities within a finite difference code to simulate single-phase and multiphase planar layers. The multiphase layers consist of a matrix phase and a disperse phase. The calculated composition profiles, interdiffusion coefficients, phase fraction profiles, and location of Kirkendall porosity are compared with experimental results. To treat diffusion in the IN718 alloy, iron and carbon are added to the existing diffusion mobility database using previous assessment work and new assessments of Fe-Al and Fe-Co.

TI Comparison of thermal expansion and oxidation behavior of various
   high-temperature coating materials and superalloys
SO MATERIALS AT HIGH TEMPERATURES
AB The thermal expansion mismatch between a metallic substrate and its external oxide scale generates a strain on cooling that is a primary cause of spallation of protective oxide scales. This study compares thermal expansion behavior and cyclic oxidation performance of the two major composition classes of high-temperature commercial coatings for protection of single-crystal superalloys. The thermal expansion of cast MCrAlY (M = Ni and/or Co) alloys and cast aluminides (NiAl, (Ni,Pt)Al and Ni(3)Al) was measured at temperatures up to 1300degreesC and compared to that of a single-crystal Ni-base superalloy. The tendency for scale spallation from each alloy was evaluated by cyclic oxidation testing at 1150degreesC. The coefficients of thermal expansion for the aluminides were lower than those of the MCrAlY-based alloys at all temperatures and scale adherence to the Hf-doped aluminides was generally superior. Scale adherence to the various compositions of MCrAlY-type alloys did not directly correlate to their thermal expansion behavior or substrate strength. For both types of materials, the presence of a reactive element (Y,Hf, etc.) had no detectable effect on thermal expansion but a major effect on scale adherence. There was no obvious influence of At content on the thermal expansion of beta phase Ni-Al compositions. The addition of Pt resulted in a lower average thermal expansion for hyperstoichiometric (Ni,Pt)AI at temperatures above 930degreesC, but this effect was not observed in hypostoichiometric (Ni,Pt)AI.

TI Selection and evaluation of heat-resistant alloys for SOFC interconnect
   applications
SO JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Over the past several years, advances in the design and fabrication of planar solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) have led to a steady reduction in the temperatures necessary for their operation. Consequently, it appears more realistic now to use low cost heat-resistant alloys for interconnect components in the SOFC stack. However, no specific criteria or inclusive study are available as a reference to help select and evaluate suitable candidates from the hundreds of available heat-resistant alloy compositions, which overall demonstrate oxidation resistance at high temperatures. In this work, composition criteria have been proposed for the preselection of heat-resistant compositions, such as Ni-, Fe-, and Co-based superalloys, Cr-based alloys, and stainless steels. The proposed criteria have been employed to establish a database of heat-resistant alloys at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, where a systematic approach has been initiated to evaluate and modify and/or develop alloys for SOFC interconnect applications. The preselected compositions are further evaluated by referring in-house studies and reference to published data. It appears that it would be difficult for traditional alloys to fully satisfy the materials requirements for long-term operation at temperatures higher than 700degreesC. However, the applicability can be improved via surface/bulk modification and by the implementation of novel stack designs. (C) 2003 The Electrochemical Society.

TI High temperature oxidation and corrosion resistant nanocrystalline
   coatings
SO SURFACE ENGINEERING
AB Traditional high temperature oxidation resistant coatings are divided into three types: aluminide or modified aluminide coatings such as Cr-Al, Si-Al and Pt-Al; MCrAlY(M=Fe,Co and/or Ni) overlayer coatings and MCrAlY+Y2O3/ZrO2 thermal barrier coatings. Characteristic of these coatings is that their compositions are very different from their substrate alloys. Protection comes from the higher aluminium content in the coating to form Al2O3 at high temperature. However, these coatings may be harmful to the mechanical properties of the alloys as a result of the interdiffusion or thermal mismatch between the coating and substrate. Recently, a new kind of coating has been developed: high temperature oxidation resistant and hot corrosion resistant nanocrystalline coating, the composition of which is the same as the substrate. The only difference is that the grain size of the coating is several orders of magnitude smaller than that of the substrate. The formation of protective Al2O3 scale is not from the high aluminium. content, but from the grain boundary diffusion. The main advantages of this kind of coating are that neither interdiffusion nor thermal mismatch exist between coating and substrate. The present paper reviews the high temperature oxidation and hot corrosion resistant nanocrystalline coating with particular reference to the authors' own results.

TI In-service degradation of metallurgical and mechanical properties of
   aluminized coatings and substrates in gas turbine blades
SO MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS
AB In-service degradation of metallurgical and mechanical properties of aluminized CoCrAlY coatings and Ni-base superalloy substrates in advanced gas turbine blades has been studied. The aluminized coatings of the unexposed and in-service exposed blades consisted of four layers with different microstructure and chemical composition. In-service environmental attack led to the deposition of Fe oxides on the top aluminized coating and formation of a thin-layered Al2O3. While in-service, Ni diffused extensively from the substrate into the near-surface coating region. The interdiffusion of Co/Ni resulted in the formation of Al/Ni rich precipitates in all the coating regions, except a near-surface coating region indicating Cr rich precipitates. A number of Cr rich precipitates were found in the substrate near the interdiffusion zone. The near-interface coating region and substrate softened at room and elevated temperatures. The ductility and low cycle fatigue life of the internal coating region at room temperature was not degraded. However, the ductility of the internal and near-interface coating regions and substrate at elevated temperatures was substantially degraded. In-service mechanical degradation of the aluminized CoCrAlY coatings is discussed in light of the metallurgical evolution.

AB The investigation of microstructure and chemical composition of the gamma and gamma' phases were performed in a Ni-base superalloy by means of analytical electron microscopy. The distribution of particular elements in the alloy was revealed using X-ray mapping in a transmission electron microscope. The detected concentration profiles of alloying elements at the gamma'/gamma interface were relatively sharp in the case of cuboidal shape of the gamma' phase while they resembled the classical diffusion profile for the oval gamma' phase. The quantitative analysis of the gamma' phase revealed much higher content of Al and lower of Ti, W, Co and Mo in the oval precipitates compared to cuboidal ones. This result is attributed to the different solidification paths, which is eutectic for the cuboidal gamma' precipitates and peritectic for the oval gamma' precipitates.

TI High temperature fatigue of a polycrystalline nickel base superalloy
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB A high temperature fatigue crack growth study on an experimental disc alloy of approximate composition Ni-14.75Cr-(14-19)Co-4.75Mo-3Al-3.75Ti-1.75Ta-0.7Hf-0.06Zr-0.02C-0.0175B (wt-%) has been undertaken. Comparison of constant load fatigue crack growth tests conducted in air and a vacuum at 725 degreesC and in air at room temperature indicate that an oxidising environment has a major influence on crack growth rates over a wide range of applied stress intensity range. In particular it contributes to enhanced embrittlement of grain boundary regions, promoting an early transition to intergranular failure along with a concomitant increase in growth rate. Constant stress intensity factor range tests at high R ratio showed that a decrease in frequency at 725 degreesC in both air and a vacuum caused an increase in the crack growth rate per cycle due to time dependent crack growth. This was most significant in air at 725 degreesC rather than in vacuo, although in both instances low frequency tests were accompanied by wholly intergranular crack growth. At lower R ratios the influence of time dependent processes is less pronounced, especially in a vacuum. For the purposes of prediction a straightforward linear summation model using sustained load crack growth results combined with high frequency growth rates was found to model reasonably the influence of frequency on crack growth rates for the air tests at 725 degreesC. This can be rationalised by the observation that in air intergranular failure proceeds by linking of prior cracked or embrittled grains some distance ahead of the crack tip. At lower values of stress intensity range a slight under prediction of growth rates was evident, but improvements could be made through the use of triangular waveform data. For the vacuum tests, the linear summation model was consistently found to over predict growth rates due to the transitory nature of the sustained load crack growth rates under repeated loading and was not generally deemed suitable. Under these conditions damage occurs close to the crack tip and direct interaction between time dependent and time independent mechanisms will occur. This is not taken into account by a summation approach and more accurate modelling of damage formation in the varying strain fields ahead of the crack tip is required to predict this.

TI Interdiffusion behavior of Ni-Cr-Al-Y coatings deposited by arc-ion
   plating
SO OXIDATION OF METALS
AB Ni-Cr-Al-P coatings were deposited on the Ni3Al-base superalloys IC-6 and K17 by are-ion plating. The results indicated that a small amount of substrate atoms, such as Co, Ti, Mo, etc., existed in the Ni-Cr-Al-Y coatings near the substrates, probably due to "sputter" and "antisputter." For the alloy K17, the impeding effect of Al was not obvious, because the temperatures of the substrate and the coating were high (420-480 degreesC) during the deposition process and interdiffusion was accelerated. However, for alloy IC-6 which contains Al, as well as a high concentration of Mo, the diffusion of Cr was impeded. Vacuum heat treatment at 1050 degreesC drastically increased diffusivities and the presence of Al and Mo was not enough to prevent some Cr diffusion. Thus, the coating became mor e uniform and close to the desired composition.

TI Analysis of carboneceous deposits from thermal stressing of a JP-8 fuel
   on superalloy foils in a flow reactor
SO INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH
AB A flow reactor study was carried out to investigate the carbon deposition on nickel-, cobalt-, molybdenum-, and iron-based alloy foils during thermal stressing of a JP-8 fuel at 500 degreesC wall temperature and 34 atm (500 psig), for 5 h at a fuel flow rate of 4 mL/min. Temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) analysis and SEM examination showed that the amount and the nature of the carbonaceous deposits on the foils depend strongly on the chemical composition of the foil surface. The amount of carbon deposited on metal foils decreased in the order Inconel 600 > Havar > Fecralloy > Waspaloy > Hastelloy-C > MoRe > Inconel 718. The presence of minor components, such as Ti, Al, and Nb, in the alloys appears to be responsible for reducing carbon deposition from jet fuel thermal stressing. This effect can be attributed to the formation of a passive layer on alloy surfaces that limits the access of deposit precursors to base metals, Ni, Fe, and Co, that catalyze deposit formation.

The microstructure of Ni-based superalloy consisted of gamma -matrix with coherent gamma'-precipitates and complex monocarbides of (Nb,Ti,W)C type.

At a constant temperature gradient at the solid-liquid interface of 12 000 K.m(-1), the measured partition ratios for Ni, W, Co, Cr, and Al depended neither on growth rate chosen from the interval (2.18 x 10(-6); 4.17 x 10(-5)) m.s(-1) nor on morphology of the solid-liquid interface.

SO JOURNAL OF THE JAPAN INSTITUTE OF METALS
AB The creep rupture life of nickel-base superalloys has been predicted using a neural network model within a Bayesian framework. The rupture life was modelled as a function of some 42 variables, including temperature, chemical composition: Cr, Co, C, Si, Mn, P, S, Mo, Cu, Ti, Al, B, N, Nb, Ta, Zr, Fe, W, V, Hf, Re, Mg, ThO2, La, four steps of heat treatment (each has its own temperature, duration and cooling rate), sample shape, solidification method, yield strength, ultimate tensile strength and elongation. The Bayesian method puts error bars on the predicted value of the rupture life and allows the significance of each individual factor to be estimated. The scale of the error bars changes with the accuracy of the prediction: it is large when the prediction is uncertain, indicating that the whole prediction system is reliable.

TI Precipitation behaviors of gamma ', epsilon and eta phases in
   Fe-Ni-Co-Nb based superalloys
SO TETSU TO HAGANE-JOURNAL OF THE IRON AND STEEL INSTITUTE OF JAPAN
AB An Fe-38Ni-13Co-4.7Nb-1.5Ti-0.4Si alloy (alloy 909) and an Fe-29.5Ni-19.7Co-4.0Nb-1.3Ti-0.6Al-0.4Si alloy (alloy 929) are the latest low thermal expansion superalloys. This study was carried out to elucidate the relation between the age-hardening and the precipitation behaviors of gamma', epsilon and eta phases in these alloys by micro Vickers hardness test and transmission electron microscopy.
   The results obtained in this study are as follows;
   (1) In aging at 893K hardening proceeds gradually with aging time and reaches to the maximum hardness; the hardness after aging for 720 ks in alloys 909 and 929 are HV400 and HV460, respectively. The rate of hardening increases with increaseing aging temperature. After reaching to the maximum hardness the hardness decreases gradually because of the coarsening of gamma' phase and the precipitation of epsilon and eta phases. The precipitation and growth rates of these phases in alloy 929 are lower than those in alloy 909.
   (2) The precipitation in alloy 909 follows in a sequence of supersaturated gamma phase --> gamma' phase --> Widmanstatten epsilon phase --> cellular eta phase. That in alloy 929 follows in a sequence of supersaturated gamma phase --> gamma' phase --> Widmanstatten (epsilon + eta) phases.
   (3) The main constituent elements of the epsilon and eta phases in these alloys are Ni, Co, Nb, Ti, and Fe and Ni, Nb, Co, Fe, and Si, respectively. The epsilon phase contains more Co and less Ni contents than the phase. There is no distinct difference in the composition between the Widmanstatten and cellular eta phases.

CY JUN 10-13, 1996
CL BIRMINGHAM, ENGLAND
AB INCONEL(R) alloy 783 is art oxidation-resistant low coefficient of thermal expansion (low CTE) superalloy developed for gas turbine applications. Turbine efficiency can be increased through the use of low-CTE shrouds and case components that maintain tight blade tip clearances at different turbine operating temperatures. To achieve low CTE, alloys based on Ni-Fe-Co compositions require Cr content be maintained at low levels. Added Cr lowers the Curie temperature and thereby increases thermal expansion rate over a wider temperature range. The necessary lack of Cr minimizes resistance to both general oxidation and stress-accelerated grain boundary oxygen enhanced cracking (SAGBO). Increased amounts of Al in alloys strengthened by y' alone also promotes SAGBO. Alloy 783 is the culmination in the development of an alloy system with very high aluminum content that, in addition to forming y', causes beta aluminide phase precipitation in the austenitic matrix. It was discovered that this type of structure can be processed to resist both SAGBO and general oxidation, while providing low thermal expansion and useful mechanical properties up to 700 degrees C. The high Al content also reduces density to 5 percent below that of superalloys such as INCONEL alloy 718. Key aspects of the alloy development are presented, including the assessment of SAGBO resistance by evaluating elevated temperature crack growth in air The alloy, now commercially available, has been successfully fabricated and welded into gas turbine engine components.

TI Solid-state diffusion welding of wrought AISI 304 stainless steel to
   nimonic AP-1 superalloy powder by hot isostatic pressing
SO WELDING JOURNAL
AB The diffusion welding characteristics of wrought AISI 304 stainless steel to a superalloy powder Nimonic AP-1 were examined in this study. After encapsulation, evacuation and degassing, the welds were hot isostatically pressed (HIPed) in two different cycles, i.e., 1200 degrees C (2192 degrees F)/3 h/147 MPa and 1270 degrees C (2318 degrees F)/3 h/121 MPa. A variation in surface condition of slain less steel was also studied for its influence on properties of the joints. These diffusion welded joints were characterized for diffusion of alloying elements, microstructural features and tensile properties.
   Most specimens showed good weld strength for both the hot isostatic pressing (HIP) cycles, except specimens with sand blasted surfaces, which gave negligible ductility because of the presence of sand particles embedded on the surface. In general, the tensile properties of the diffusion welded specimens were limited by the mechanical properties of stainless steel and not the joint interface. The microstructural examination of a HIP welded joint showed a thin weld zone of 30 - 40 mu m. While the stainless steel region of the welded specimen showed a relatively clean structure, the Nimonic AP-1 region showed precipitation of dark particles near the interface extending over 20-60 mu m. Electron microprobe analysis of the diffusion welded zone revealed enrichment of titanium-rich particles along prior particle boundaries (PPBs) near the interface. Electron microprobe analysis further revealed extensive diffusion of Ni, Co and Al elements into stainless steel and that of Fe into Nimonic AP-1 superalloy indicating complex composition of the weld interlayer.

AB The resistance to stress-accelerated grain boundary oxygen embrittlement (SAGBO) in Fe-Ni-Co-Nb-Ti controlled low expansion superalloy has been improved by trace yttrium element addition. The platelet precipitates in the alloy have been studied by means of optical microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, convergent beam electron microscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction technique. The crystal structure and the chemical composition of the platelet phase have been determined. The phase has a CaCu5-type crystal structure (space group P6/mmm) with lattice parameters a = 0.498 nm and c = 0.408 nm. The crystallographic orientation relationship between the phase and the matrix is found to be (<(11)over bar>1)(gamma)/(0001)(H), [(1) over bar 10](gamma)/[11 (2) over bar 0](H). High-resolution images show that the interface between the platelet phase and the matrix is semicoherent and some stacking faults have been found in the platelet phase. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science S.A.

Interatomic potential parameters were evaluated for various additive elements, Ni, and Ni3Al so that lattice constant a, cohesive energy E-0 and elastic constants c(11) and c(12) could be reproduced. Changes of all physical quantities evaluated here were found to be proportional to the changes of concentration of additive elements. The dependencies were fitted by the linear least square method and the obtained parameters were saved as a database. The calculated slope parameters of the lattice constant were compared to measured slope parameters for various additives in the gamma phase. The measured slope parameters were reproduced very well.

(wt.%) was prepared by the investment casting process. The alloy was solution annealed at 1553K for 2h and then air cooled, followed by a two-step aging treatment for 5h at 1293K and then air cooled, followed by 1143K and air cooled to room temperature. The microstructural characteristics were evaluated through optical and electron microscopic observations. Electro probe microanalysis and energy-dispersive analysis of X-rays were conducted to study the (W, Mo)-rich phase precipitated in the new alloy. The results showed that the alloy is coarse grained (similar to 5mm) with serrated grain boundaries and a relatively homogeneous composition. This alloy contains uniform gamma-gamma' microstructure and a fine, discrete W-Mo-containing phase together with discrete carbides M6C and M23C6, which coexist at grain boundaries. All of these microstructural features are thought to be beneficial to the superior creep rupture life of the newly developed nickel-base superalloy. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1997.

AB The useful operating life of superalloy components operating in gas turbines is dependent to a large extent on the ability of applied surface coatings to resist corrosive degradation. Coatings have been fine-tuned over many years of use to give satisfactory performance in airborne applications, but the recent adoption of I:as turbines in the utility sector has placed renewed demand on the need to evaluate and develop existing and new coating systems. This paper describes the behaviour of a series of vacuum plasma sprayed MCrAlY(Si) and Al/Si coatings applied to the Ni-base IN738 and UD520 and Co-base FSX-414 and X45 superalloys. Test specimens have been exposed to both simple argon-O-2-SO2 gas mixtures and to simulated combustion gas mixtures in a low-velocity burner rig for times up to 1000 hours in the temperature range 800 to 1000 degrees C, The results obtained in the form of microstructural changes suggest an upper temperature limit below 900 degrees C for the application of high Al anti Si-containing coatings due to interdiffusion with the base alloy and a strong influence of combustion gas composition on corrosion rate.

SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB A detailed analysis of the time-dependent factors affecting the chromium-aluminization of the nickel-base superalloy Rene 80H in cementation packs at 1120 degrees C has been carried out. The packs contained a 4% NaCl+2% NH4Cl mixed activator and a Cr-5 wt.% Al master alloy. The analysis involved measuring the residual pack activator-mixture content and master alloy composition as functions of deposition time, and using the data to calculate equilibrium partial pressures in the pack as a function of time. It is shown that both activator-mixture content and master alloy composition change with time, consequently leading to changes in the pack gas phase composition. The changes in the pack environment are then used to explain the time-dependence of coating surface composition: a simplified mechanism involving a combined parabolic accumulation of beta-NiAl and two-stage linear accumulation of alpha-Cr is described.

The weld microstructure consisted of fine (10- to 50-nm) irregularly shaped gamma' precipitates (0.65 to 0.75 volume fraction) within the gamma matrix. APFIM compositions of the gamma and gamma' phases were found to be different from those in the base metal. Concentration profiles across the gamma and gamma' phases showed extensive variations of Cr, Co and Al concentrations as a function of distance within the gamma phase. Calculated lattice misfits near the gamma/gamma' interface in the welds are positive values compared to the negative values for base metal.

AB The microstructural development in PWA-1480 superalloy electron beam welds (Ni-11.0at%Al-11.5%Cr-1.9%Ti-5.1%Co-4.0%Ta-1.3%W) was characterized. Optical microscopy revealed a branched dendritic structure in the weld metal. Transmission electron microscopy of these welds, in the as-welded condition, showed fine cuboidal (0.05-0.5 mu m) L1(2)-ordered gamma' precipitates within the gamma grains. The average volume percentage of the gamma' precipitates was found to be similar to 75%. Atom probe analyses revealed that the composition of the gamma matrix was Ni-4.6at%Al-25.5%Cr-0.4%Ti-9.4%Co-0.8%Ta-2.9%W and that of the gamma' precipitates was Ni-18.2at%Al-2.6%Cr-2.4%Ti-2.8%Co-7.1%Ta-1.5%W. These compositions were compared with the previous APFIM analyses of commercial PWA-1480 single crystals that had received conventional heat treatments. Small differences were found in the chromium and aluminum levels and these may be due to the nonequilibrium nature of phase transformations that occur during weld cooling. No solute segregation was detected at the gamma-gamma' interface. The APFIM results were also compared with the thermodynamic calculations of alloying element partitioning between the gamma and gamma' phases using the ThermoCalc(TM) program.

AB Single crystals of the rhenium-containing nickel-base superalloy CMSX-4 were investigated using a time of flight atom probe. The distribution of the alloying elements in the two phases, matrix (gamma phase) and precipitate (gamma' phase), was studied. The high spatial resolution of the atom probe allows to analyse the gamma-gamma' interface. The transition from matrix to gamma' phase takes place within one atomic layer. The boundary is enriched with titanium. Layer-by-layer analysis of (001) planes of the L1(2) ordered gamma' phase reveals alternating Ni- and Al-rich planes. The probability of site occupation by different elements could be evaluated. An approximate formula of the gamma' phase is given by (Ni-81 Ti-3 Ta-2 Cr-5 Co-7 W-2)(3) (Ni-20 Al-70 Ta-6 Co-2 W-2). Rhenium is found mainly in the matrix and has a tendency to build clusters.

TI FABRICATION OF FULLY DENSIFIED NI3AL INTERMETALLIC COMPOUND AND NI+NI3AL
   2 PHASES ALLOY BY PRESSURELESS SINTERING OF NIAL+NI MIXED POWDER
   COMPACTS
SO JOURNAL OF THE JAPAN INSTITUTE OF METALS
AB The pressureless sintering densification characteristic of NiAl + Ni mixed powder, the composition of which was mainly in Ni3Al intermetallic compound and Ni + Ni3Al two phase alloy, was investigated. It was found that completely densified compacts of Ni3Al intermetallic compound and Ni + Ni3Al alloy with a large amount of Ni3Al could be obtained by controlling the powder particle size and the sintering condition, though the densification of Ni-rich (82-100 at%Ni) sintered compacts was incomplete. These results were thought to be explained by the authors' theory of ''Equilibrium gas pressure'', i.e., ''The densification in the final stage of solid phase sintering is affected by whether the equilibrium pressure of the gas (CO in this case) generated by the reduction of oxide is higher or lower than the surface stress (the driving force of the shrinkage) of the closed pores'', which have been reported in the previous papers. The bending strength and hardness of the completely densified Ni3Al intermetallic compound were 1.3 GPa and 330 H(V), respectively, and those of Ni+Ni3Al alloy were 2.9 GPa and 310 H(V), respectively.

TI EROSION RESISTANT COATING BY LOW-PRESSURE PLASMA SPRAYING
SO ISIJ INTERNATIONAL
AB Cavitation erosion and drain erosion are major causes of failure of mechanical devices in fluid handling systems. The authors investigated the application of plasma spraying technique to the formation of coatings with high resistance against the cavitation and drain erosion damage. By using low pressure plasma spraying, some coatings of cermet and metallic alloy materials were prepared and tested for the cavitation erosion behavior. Cobalt base alloy coating shows much more excellent resistance to the erosion than that of Stellite-6, which has been widely used as the wrought product to shield a steam turbine blade from the damage. In spite of the similar chemical composition of the Co alloy to that of Stellite-6, the erosion-performance is different. Microscopic characterization of the deposite reveals that the superiority of the coating is caused by the extended solid solubility of carbon resulted from the rapid solidification of the sprayed droplets.

TI CRATER STRUCTURE IN ATOMIZED NICKEL SUPERALLOY ELECTRODE
SO RUSSIAN METALLURGY
AB The structure formed in the crater of Nl-Al-Ti-Cr-Co-W-Mo-Nb-Hf-C-B nickel superalloy subjected to centrifugal atomization was studied. A marked difference was found in the behavior of boron and carbon in the subsurface layer of the crater caused by the significantly deeper zone of homogeneous solid solution distribution of boron (down to 1 mm) compared to that of carbon (0.1 mm).
   Cracks up to 10 mm deep were revealed, caused. apparently, by the thermal gradient on electrode atomization accompanied by the formation of liquation pores resulting from intense boron migration to cracks and, further along cracks to the surface. The composition of boride and carbide phases was determined. The mechanism of crater structure formation was suggested.

TI MICROSTRUCTURE AND RESISTANCE TO CRACKING OF MODIFIED AL-SI AND AL-CR
   DIFFUSION COATINGS ON ZS6K NICKEL-BASED SUPERALLOYS
SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB The subject of the investigations was a superalloy with the following chemical composition: 0.14 wt.% C, 10.2 wt.% Cr, 5.3 wt.% Al, 2.8 wt.% Ti, 3.7 wt.% Mo, 5.2 wt.% W, 4.7 wt.% Co, 1.5 wt.% Fe and the balance nickel. A pack cementation technique of coating was applied. Acoustic emission signals were recorded as a function of specimen elongation (SIGMAN-epsilon). The values of elongation (epsilon0) at the moment of the first crack appearance and at the beginning of rapid fracture were measured.
   The crack resistances of the aluminide, silicoaluminide and chromoaluminide diffusion coatings were the main subject of the studies performed. If we take the co parameter as a crack resistance criterion it was found that, when compared with the aluminide coatings, Al-Si and Al-Cr coatings are less resistant. The crack morphologies of aluminium and Al-Cr coatings were similar in character. Among the typical features were cracks that did not spread through the entire layer thickness and discontinuous cracks with branches. In the depleted zone of the coatings, cracks developed along the NiAl phase grain boundaries.

SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB This contribution discusses the results of an analytical electron microscopy study of precipitates and insolubles in the Ni-Fe-based superalloy Incoloy 903. The large insolubles in the alloy are observed to be carbides and/or carbonitrides of niobium and titanium. During thermomechanical processing, fine carbides are observed to precipitate on grain boundaries and prior grain boundaries. Also observed to precipitate along the grain boundaries and prior grain boundaries are MN-type (M - Nb, Ti; N = Ni, Co, Fe) phosphides, a phase rich in niobium. The relative proportion of carbides to phosphides is observed to increase with an increase in the final solution treatment temperature, with complete phosphide dissolution at 975-degrees-C/1 h. The phosphides are observed to have an orthorhombic crystal structure with cell dimensions a = 5.99 angstrom, b = 3.35 angstrom and c = 7.06 angstrom. The chemical composition of the coarse carbides, fine carbides and phosphides has been determined. The chemical composition and lattice parameter indicates the phosphides to be based on NbCoP with iron and nickel substituting for some of the cobalt sites.

SO METALLURGICAL TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB The average phase composition of the single-crystal nickel-base alloy SRR 99 after solution treatment, single and double stage annealing, and overaging has been determined by energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDX) (HPGe detector) in a transmission electron microscope (TEM).  Calculations of hypothetical nominal compositions for the alloy, using measured compositions of gamma' phase and matrix as a function of the volume fraction of gamma' phase, allow determination of the volume fraction of gamma' phase at the minimum error between nominal composition and hypothetical nominal composition.  After single-stage annealing, the gamma' concentrations of W, Al, and Co are higher, and those of Cr, Ta, Ti, and Ni are lower near the phase boundary compared to the average concentration of a precipitate.  These concentration gradients and the integral concentrations of element in the gamma' phase are interpreted by the temperature-dependent solubility of elements in the gamma' phase.

TI DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW NI-BASE SUPERALLOY FOR INDUSTRIAL GAS-TURBINE
   COMBUSTOR BY STATISTICAL ALLOY DESIGN METHOD
SO TETSU TO HAGANE-JOURNAL OF THE IRON AND STEEL INSTITUTE OF JAPAN
AB A new Ni-base superalloy has been developed for gas turbine combustor.  In the first stage, multiple regression analysis was conducted on the published material data of superalloys.  The eatimation equations were established to estimate the mechanical properties such as stress rupture strength and tensile properties, and physical properties such as density and thermal conductivity.  Alloy design program by statistical method was made to select the alloy chemical compositions which will satisfy the requirements of structural design.  By means of this alloy design method, 22%Cr-8%Co-9%Mo-3%W-1%Al-0.3%Ti-Ni base alloy (%:mass%) was set up for combustor superalloy.  The superalloy plates using these alloy elements were manufactured by vacuum induction and remelting process weighing 2000 kg.
   The mechanical and physical properties were examined on those plates, and it is confirmed that these estimated values by alloy design coincide with the testing measured values.  As above test results, it is considered that the statistical alloy design is useful for developing new superalloys.  The new Ni-base superalloy also has good workability, good mechanical and physical properties for industrial gas turbine combustor.
