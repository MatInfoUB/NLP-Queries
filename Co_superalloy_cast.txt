TI Improvement of the high temperature oxidation of TaC-strengthened
   Co(Cr)-based cast superalloys by the addition of nickel
SO CORROSION ENGINEERING SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB In this work, nickel is added in substitution to cobalt in the composition of a cast cobalt-based chromium-rich superalloy designed to obtain a double-phased {fcc matrix + TaC} microstructure. Two nickel amounts were tested, 13 and 26 wt-%Ni, for 25 wt-%Cr, 0.4 wt-%C and 6 wt-%Ta, the rest being cobalt. The obtained as-cast microstructures are not different from the starting alloy's one, contrarily to the hardness which became lower. The oxidation tests at 1200 degrees C for 170 h demonstrated a significant improvement of the alloy's behaviour, especially for an addition of 26 wt-%Ni. This seems to be attributed to an easier Cr diffusion towards the oxidation front as suggested by the observed Cr contents in extreme surface as well as by the lower Cr concentration gradients. In addition, the TaC seemed to be morphologically more stable in the presence of nickel in the alloys than in the absence of Ni.

TI Microstructure and mechanical behavior at elevated temperatures of a
   novel nickel base superalloy heavily alloyed with forming and
   substitution elements
SO LETTERS ON MATERIALS
AB A novel nickel base superalloy heavily alloyed with gamma' forming and substitution elements, particularly with rhenium and tungsten, has been proposed in the present work as a potential die material for die forging of the most hard-to-deform nickel base superalloys. The superalloy composition is Ni-13(Al, Ti, Nb, Ta)-27(Cr, Co, Mo, W, Re, Si, C, B) (wt.%). The superalloy ingot was manufactured by vacuum induction melting. Microstructure examination showed that the as-cast condition was characterized by a coarse grained dendritic structure consisted of coarse gamma grains containing gamma' precipitates with a size 0.3 -1 mu m and primary gamma' particles with a size 5 -100 mu m. A small amount of carbides and topologically close packed (TCP) phases was also detected. The microstructure examination suggests that the general solidification pathway was L ->gamma ->gamma', as it is in nickel base superalloys. At the same time, the primary gamma' particles were probably formed via the peritectic reaction L-noneq + gamma ->gamma', where L-noneq is the nonequilibrium liquid, which was retained at the peritectic temperature. The superalloy was subjected to heat treatment including solid solution treatment and ageing. The heat treatment led to coagulation of the primary gamma' phase and to a slight decrease in the volume fractions of carbides and TCP phases. The heat treated condition was used to prepare samples for compression tests, which were performed at 900-1200 degrees C up to the true strain e= 0.1. The yield strength of the novel superalloy was generally appreciably higher as compared with those of known nickel base superalloys and alloys based on the Ni3Al intermetallic phase.

TI Effect of Co on Microstructure and Stress Rupture Properties of K4750
   Alloy
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA-ENGLISH LETTERS
AB The effects of substituting Co for Fe on the microstructure and stress rupture properties of K4750 alloy were studied. The microstructure of the alloy without Co (K4750 alloy) and the alloy containing Co (K4750-Co alloy) were analyzed. Substitution of Co for Fe inhibited the decomposition of MC carbide and the precipitation of eta phase during long-term aging treatment. In K4750-Co alloy, the morphology of MC carbide at the grain boundary (GB) remained dispersed blocky shape and no eta phase was observed after aging at 750 degrees C for 3000 h. However, in K4750 alloy, almost all the MC carbides at GBs broke down into granular M23C6 carbide and needle-like eta phase. The addition of cobalt could delay the decomposition of MC carbides, which accordingly restricted the elemental supply for the formation of eta phase. The stress rupture tests were conducted on two alloys at 750 degrees C/430 MPa. When Co is substituted for Fe in K4750 alloy, the stress rupture life increased from 164.10 to 264.67 h after standard heat treatment. This was mainly attributed to increased concentration of Al, Ti and Nb in gamma ' phase in K4750-Co alloy, which further enhanced the strengthening effect of gamma ' phase. After aging at 750 degrees C for 3000 h, substitution of Co for Fe can also cause the stress rupture life at 750 degrees C/430 MPa to increase from 48.72 to 208.18 h. The reason was mainly because MC carbide degradation and eta phase precipitation in K4750 alloy, which promoted the initiation and propagation of micro-crack during stress rupture testing.

TI Evolution of Microstructures and Properties of a New gamma/gamma '
   Co-Based Superalloy via Forging Process
SO JOM
AB A new gamma/gamma ' Co-based superalloy has been developed with a large temperature range between the gamma ' solvus and solidus temperature, which can be formed through the conventional casting and wrought processing route. The microstructure, mechanical and corrosion resistance properties of this new gamma/gamma ' Co-based superalloy are characterized in the present study. The results show that even in the forged state, the partial recrystallization and grain growth processes occur, but the gamma ' precipitates remain very fine. Forging and aging increase the mechanical strength and facilitate the formation of stable passive films due to decreased low-angle boundaries and increased sigma 3 twin boundaries. The twin boundaries are beneficial for improving both the mechanical properties and corrosion resistance, which provides guidance for tailoring the microstructure and properties of novel Co-based superalloys.

TI Identification of Laves phases in a Zr or Hf containing gamma-gamma'
   Co-base superalloy
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB ZrCo2 and HfCo2 Laves phases were found and characterized in gamma-gamma' Co-base superalloys using high-energy X-ray diffraction, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy. They formed during casting and are stable during long-term annealing at 900 degrees C. The ZrCo2 phase with a cubic MgCu2-type structure exhibits numerous nano-twins and stacking faults, while HfCo2 has a hexagonal MgNi2-type structure instead of MgCu2-type in contrast to literature. Their chemical compositions strongly deviated from stoichiometry and significant amounts of Al and Ware contained in these phases. These could affect the atomic radius ratio and valence electron concentration and thus change the structure of the Laves phases. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Solidification and Segregation Behavior of Nickel-Based Superalloy
   GH4282
SO RARE METAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING
AB The solidification process and the segregation behavior of the elements of GH4282 superalloy were investigated by a combination of differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), microstructure observation and thermodynamic calculation. The solidification sequence and the characteristics of elements segregation were obtained. The results show that the solidification sequence of GH4282 is as follows: gamma matrix, MC carbide and a small amount of boride. The solidus-liquidus temperature range determined by DSC is 1316 similar to 4367 degrees C. The measured solvus temperature of MC carbide is 1338 degrees C. Thermodynamic calculations show that C, B, Ti and Mo segregate to the interdendritic regions, while Al segregates to the dendrite cores. Cr, Fe and Co do not exhibit any significant tendency to segregate to either the interdendritic region or to the dendrite core during the solidification process of GH4282 superalloy. These results about segregation behavior of the elements agree well with the as-cast microstructure observation.

TI Element Segregation and Solidification Behavior of a Nb, Ti, Al
   Co-Strengthened Superalloy & x42d;K151
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA-ENGLISH LETTERS
AB The as-cast microstructure, element segregation and solidification behavior of a multi-alloyed superalloy & x42d;K151 have been investigated. The results show that the severe element segregation leads to the complicated precipitations at the inter-dendritic region, including eta-Ni-3(Ti, Nb), eutectic (gamma + gamma ') and Laves, which shows the characteristics of both Ti, Al-strengthened and Nb-strengthened alloys. Differential thermal analysis, heating and quenching tests reveal the solidification sequence as follows: Liquids -> gamma matrix -> (Nb, Ti)C -> eta-Ni-3(Ti, Nb) -> eutectic (gamma + gamma ') -> Laves. The melting points are between 1250 and 1260 degrees C for (Nb, Ti)C, between 1200 and 1210 degrees C for eta phase, between 1180 and 1190 degrees C for eutectic (gamma + gamma ') and Laves. gamma ' initially precipitates from matrix at 1150 degrees C and achieves the maximum precipitation at 1130 degrees C. According to the microstructure evolution captured during solidification and composition analysis by an energy dispersive spectrometer and electron probe microanalyzer, (Nb, Ti)/Al ratio is put forward to explain the formation of eta-Ni-3(Ti, Nb) and eutectic (gamma + gamma '). The solidification of gamma matrix increased the Nb, Ti concentration in the residual liquids, so the high (Nb, Ti)/Al ratio would result in the formation of eta-Ni-3(Ti, Nb); the precipitation of the phase consumed Nb and Ti and decreased the (Nb, Ti)/Al ratio in the liquid, which led to the precipitation of eutectic (gamma + gamma '). Laves formed by the sides of eta-Ni-3(Ti, Nb) and in front of the eutectic (gamma + gamma ') after Al, Ti were further depleted by the two phases and Cr, Co, Mo were rejected to liquids.

TI Hot deformation behavior and DRX mechanism in a gamma-gamma '
   cobalt-based superalloy
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB gamma-gamma'cobalt-based superalloys have been the main focus of attention as a new class of high temperature materials. The present research studies the hot deformation, microstructure evolution, and dynamic recrystallization (DRX) mechanisms of a cast Co-Al-W superalloy during the hot compression process. The microstructure of the starting material is constituted of large MC carbide particles within a coarse grain structure. Two hot deformation regimes, i.e., low temperature (950 degrees C-1050 degrees C) and high temperature (1100 degrees C-1200 degrees C) were designed and performed. Flow curve and constitutive analysis using a hyperbolic sine equation evidenced two distinct behaviors among the regimes. Microstructural evaluation revealed a large volume fraction of fine gamma'particles with radius less than 100 nm, precipitated during heating and isothermal holding, which precluded DRX in the low temperature regime. In the high temperature regime, new grains were formed through a special discontinuous DRX at three different regions in the microstructure: original grain boundaries, vicinity of MC carbides and the interior of the relatively coarse grains; these may be attributed to the mechanisms of SIBM, PSN and sub-grain growth, respectively. A conceptual descriptive model for the especial DRX phenomenon was proposed.

TI Effect of rhenium and cobalt additions on the microstructure and gamma
   prime phase stability of vacuum arc melted modified nickel-based
   superalloys grade MGA 1400
SO MATERIALS TESTING
AB The effect of rhenium and cobalt additions on the microstructure and gamma prime phase stability of modified nickel-based superalloy, grade MGA1400 by means of a vacuum arc melting method with different contents of rhenium (Re) and cobalt (Co) was investigated. After being subjected to heat treatment, the size of the gamma prime particles was slightly reduced with increasing rhenium content. Then, the alloys were exposed at a temperature of 1173 K for 1800 ks. The results showed that increasing the rhenium addition leads to a slower coarsening rate of the gamma prime particles. Furthermore, the shape of the gamma prime particles changed to a more cubic shape. However, an excessive rhenium content (> 1.21 wt.-%) promotes the formation of a topologically close-packed phase after a 360 ks exposure at 1173 K. It can be concluded that an increase in rhenium content can result in a lower coarsening rate of the gamma prime particles. The cobalt addition is beneficial for impeding or slowing the precipitation of topologically close-packed phases at an elevated temperature.

TI Atomic size effect of alloying elements on the formation, evolution and
   strengthening of gamma'-Ni3Al precipitates in Ni-based superalloys
SO INTERMETALLICS
AB Mechanical properties of Ni-based superalloys strongly depend on phase and site preferences of alloying elements which influence bonding strength within gamma'-Ni3Al precipitates and microstructural characteristics of these unique class of materials. In the current work, therefore, besides disclosure of the phase partitioning behaviours of alloying X elements (i.e. X = Co, Cr, Nb, Ta or Ti) among gamma' and gamma phases, their site occupancy tendencies in gamma' precipitates (determined via first-principles ab initio calculations at 0 K) and effects on the microstructural evolution of Ni80Al15X5 alloy systems (exposed to aging at 800 degrees C for 4, 16, 64 and 256 h, respectively) have been examined. Bonding features of Ni-Al, Ni-X and Al-X atomic pairs within Ni3Al-X intermetallics have been simulated by utilizing charge density difference (CDD) method, which reveals site preferences of alloying X elements as well. Present theoretical and experimental investigations have shown that mechanical strength of Nibased superalloys is predominantly affected by bonding properties within precipitates. As atomic radii of alloying X elements become closer to that of Al atom, energy change parameter, E-Ni -> Al(X) values decrease and more Al sublattice sites are preferentially occupied in gamma' precipitates. Correspondingly, bonding strength of Ni-X atomic pairs along < 110 > directions of Ni3Al-X phases and micro-hardness properties of both as-cast and pre aged Ni80Al15X5 alloy systems enhance in the order of X = Co < Cr < Ti < Nb < Ta additions. Nevertheless, with increasing aging time, mechanical strength of alloys weakens in parallel with increasing size of gamma' precipitates simultaneously evolved from near-spherical to irregular forms.

TI Microstructure and mechanical properties of direct laser metal deposited
   Haynes 282 superalloy
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB Direct laser metal deposition (LMD) is a directed energy deposition based additive manufacturing process developed for a wide range of applications that are currently employed in aerospace, medical and automotive sectors. In the present study, a 100 mm x 15 mm x 25 mm block of Haynes 282 (HY282) superalloy was fabricated by LMD. The effect of several post-deposition heat-treatments revealed a wide range of strength and ductility of HY282 samples that can be tuned to obtain the best material properties. The microstructure and mechanical properties of the as-deposited and heat-treated specimens are investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray-diffraction (XRD), uniaxial tension test, and micro-hardness measurements. The SEM and XRD investigation revealed the formation of columnar dendrites having [001] growth direction opposite to the heat flow direction during LMD. The as-deposited samples revealed the presence of gamma, gamma', Ti and Mo-rich MC, and Mo-rich M6C phases with the strengthening gamma' phase having an average precipitate size of 8.25 nm in the interdendritic region. The EDS investigation revealed the uniform distribution of Ni, Al, Cr, Co in the overall deposit with high segregation of Ti and Mo in the interdendritic regions. The corresponding hardness of 294 HV, yield strength of 633 MPa, and 31.5% elongation was recorded in the as-deposited samples that were better than the as-cast properties. The LMD specimen heat treated at 788 degrees C for 16 h revealed a homogeneous distribution of gamma' with an average size of 31 nm with a globular and Chinese script type carbides interconnected in the interdendritic region. The corresponding hardness of 410 HV, yield strength of 894 MPa, ultimate tensile strength of 1200 MPa, and 18% elongation was recorded. These results establish that HY282 is an attractive material for the LMD process.

TI Numerical investigations of freckles in directionally solidified
   nickel-based superalloy casting with abrupt contraction in cross section
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB Evolution of grain structure and formation of freckle defects were simulated in directionally solidified nickel-based superalloy casting with abrupt contraction in cross-section area. A two-dimensional (2D) Cellular Automaton (CA) - Finite Element (FE) model was presented. The transport of liquid momentum, heat and solute mass at macroscopic scale, the development of grain envelopes at mesoscopic scale and microsegregation were fully coupled. Influences of alloying elements, cooling rate and geometrical shape of casting on freckle formation were studied. CAFE simulations show that through reducing the initial concentration of destabilizing element (W), the formation of freckle along casting edges was suppressed. Elements such as Co, Ti and Ta are not critical elements that affect density inversion in mushy region. Increasing cooling rate apparently decreased the freckling tendency. Without geometric contraction, there was no obvious formation of freckles along casting edges. It was numerically showed that the contraction in cross section introduced the high-permeability path for the upward fluid flow during directional solidification, which enhanced the freckling tendency.

TI Effects of Nb on hot tensile deformation behavior of cast Haynes 25
   Co-Cr-W-Ni alloy
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Effect of Nb on the hot tensile deformation behavior of cast Haynes 25 Co-Cr-W-Ni alloy was investigated in temperature range of 950-1200 degrees C. In the base alloy, thermodynamic calculations showed that M23C6 and M6C are the stable forms of carbides at temperatures below 1000 degrees C and over 1050 degrees C, respectively. For Nb-containing alloy, however, WC and NbC are observed below 1050 degrees C. At higher temperatures, W carbides dissolve and tungsten diffuses into NbC particles to form complex carbides. The yield point phenomena (YPP) were observed in both alloys at temperatures over 1050 degrees C due to the immobilization of matrix dislocations by W, Cr and C. Addition of Nb increased the strength and elongation due to the precipitation of NbC carbides. Absorbing the solute atoms and favoring dynamic recrystallization (DRX) seems to be the possible mechanisms. Loss of hot ductility occurred in both alloys at 1050 degrees C. It was attributed to the dissolution of carbides into matrix and their negative effects on dynamic recovery (DRV) and recrystallization. DRX was the major microstructural mechanism at high temperature, e.g. 1150 degrees C. At low temperatures, e.g. 950 degrees C, only DRV occurred. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Surface/Interface Quality Diagnosis of Alloy Casting by Laser Induced
   Breakdown Spectroscopy
SO SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
AB The investment precision casting technology is widely adopted in manufacturing superalloy castings. Single crystal superalloy casting blades have high precision in dimension, without inner defects and surface defects. Knobs, pits and shrinkage cavity on surface of castings are caused by unsuitable temperature field, melted alloy flow field, and interface reaction of melted alloy with ceramic shell. The laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) is an efficient surface and interface analysis technique, with obvious advantage in diagnosis of casting surface/interface, with micro destruction, independent on surface planeness of sample. The parameters were optimized in depth analysis of single crystal superalloy by LIBS. A good spatial resolution has been obtained at 2 mm aperture, 500 mJ of output energy and off focus radiation with 1 064 nm pulse Gaussian laser beam; meanwhile spectrum signal distortion brought from ablation and excitation of surface by exceeding secondary diffraction ring with low laser energy density was reduced. Ablated volume per pulse was linear to output of laser energy with good correlation, positively correlated to the aperture diameter, independent on shot frequency. Depth analysis of surface and interface of single crystal superalloy blade was performed by LIBS. Alloy depletion of Al, Ti, Ni, Cr and Co in DD407 single crystal blade was observed with significant depletion of Al and Ti up to 50 mu m depth, using SiO2 -Al2O3 ceramic shell with mullite phase in cast process. The alloy depletion of edge of the blade was more outstanding than thick part. Precipitation of calcium salt, magnesium salt, sodium salt and carbon matters on blade surface occurs after dissolution to remove ceramic shell and ceramic core. Sodium salt has been removed completely after washed with boiling water and ultrasonic washing; most of calcium matters, magnesium matters and carbon matters have been removed and small amount remained in 3 similar to 5 mu m depth. LIBS is efficient in terms of composition-depth distribution analysis of alloy casting surface and interface, providing surface/interface quality criteria and presenting bright application prospect.

TI Investigation on the homogenization treatment and element segregation on
   the microstructure of a /-cobalt-based superalloy
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MINERALS METALLURGY AND MATERIALS
AB The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of element segregation on the microstructure and phase in a / cobalt- based superalloy. Several samples were prepared from a cast alloy and homogenized at 1300 degrees C for different times, with a maximum of 24 h. A microstructural study of the cast alloy using wavelength-dispersive spectroscopic analysis revealed that elements such as Al, Ti, and Ni segregated mostly within interdendritic regions, whereas W atoms were segregated within dendrite cores. With an increase in homogenization time, segregation decreased and the initial dendritic structure was eliminated. Field-emission scanning electron microscopy micrographs showed that the phases in the cores and interdendritic regions of the as-cast alloy were 392 and 124 nm, respectively. The size difference of was found to be due to the different segregation behaviors of constituent elements during solidification. After homogenization, particularly after 16 h, segregation decreased; thus, the size, chemical composition, and hardness of the precipitated phase was mostly uniform throughout the samples.

TI Primary Microstructure Characterization of As-Casted Co-20Ni-7Al-7W
   Superalloy
SO ARCHIVES OF FOUNDRY ENGINEERING
AB The primary microstructure of new Co-based superalloy of Co-20Ni-7Al-7W (at.%) type was showed in this article. The alloy was manufactured by induction melting in vacuum furnaces. This alloy is a part of new group of high-temperature materials based on Co solid solution and strengthened by coherent L1(2) phase similar to Ni-based superalloys with gamma' phase. The final form of Co-ss/L1(2) microstructure is obtained after fully heat treatment included homogenization, solutionizing and aging processes. But first step of heat treatment thermal parameters determination is characterization of primary microstructure of alloys after casting process with special attentions on segregations of alloying elements in solid solution and presences of structural elements such as eutectic areas, and other phases precipitations. In analysed case the relatively high homogeneity of chemical composition was expected especially in the case of W distribution, what was confirmed be SEM/EDS analysis in dendritic and interdendritic areas.

TI Effect of directional solidification process on microstructure and
   stress rupture property of a hot corrosion resistant single crystal
   superalloy
SO CHINA FOUNDRY
AB The influences of different directional solidification processes, i.e., the high rate solidification (HRS) and liquid metal cooling (LMC), on microstructure and stress rupture property of DD488 alloy were investigated. The DD488 alloy was directional solidified by both HRS and LMC processes. The microstructure and stress rupture properties at 980 degrees C/250 MPa were investigated by using optical microscopy (OM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electron microprobe analyzer (EPMA), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and stress rupture testing. The results indicated that the LMC process refined the primary dendrite arm and decreased the microporosity volume fraction and solidification segregations of Cr and Co in as-cast DD488 alloy. After standard heat treatment of 1,260 degrees C/4 h, AC (air cooling) + 1,080 degrees C/4 h, AC + 870 degrees C/24 h, AC, the gamma' morphology in LMC alloy was more cuboidal than that in HRS alloy, and the y' volume fraction of LMC alloy was higher than that of HRS alloy. The stress rupture life at 980 degrees C/250 MPa of HRS alloy was 76.8 h, and it increased to 110.0 h in LMC alloy. The LMC process increased the stress rupture life due to the higher gamma' volume fraction, more perfect rafting structure and finer interfacial dislocation networks.

TI Effect of heat treatment and hot working on microstructure and
   mechanical properties of a novel nickel base superalloy
SO LETTERS ON MATERIALS
AB The microstructure and mechanical properties of a novel nickel base superalloy intended for manufacturing of die tools and parts for gas turbine engine have been investigated. The superalloy designated as SLZhS-1R had the following composition: Ni-47(Al, Cr, Co, Ta, W, Hf)-0.2(C, B) (wt. %). The as-cast superalloy was subjected to homogenization and heterogenization heat treatment, which is typically performed before hot working. However, the heat treatment led to appearance of platelike precipitates, which are not favorable for the hot workability. Therefore, the superalloy was subjected to hot working taking the as-cast condition as the initial one. To do it, unidirectional hot forging at a temperature slightly below the.' solvus temperature with a strain rate of epsilon' similar to 10(-2) s(-1) was carried out. The as-cast superalloy showed reasonable workability that allowed producing sound forgings. The forging procedure provided formation of mixed microstructure consisted of coarse non-recrystallized and fine recrystallized. grains. EBSD analysis of the forged workpiece showed that the fraction of highangle grain boundaries was insignificant. The hot forging resulted in dynamic recovery, whereas recrystallization processes occurred only locally near the. grain boundaries. Tensile tests were carried out for the heat treated and hot forged conditions as well as for the as-cast condition. The heat treated and especially the forged and heat treated condition showed appreciably higher strength and ductility as compared to those of the

TI Effect of Ta and Ti on the solidification characteristics of novel
   gamma'-strengthened Co-base superalloys
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB The effects of Ta and Ti on the microstructure, segregation and solidification path of Co-7A1-8W-base alloy were investigated using directional solidification quenching experiments and isothermal solidification quenching experiments. The results showed that the as-cast microstructure of the Co-7Al-8W alloy (Base alloy) is the gamma single phase. The Al element slightly segregates to the interdendritic regions, the W element slightly segregates to the dendritic core, and Co has almost no segregation. The solidification path of the Co-7Al-8W-4Ti alloy is L -> L-1+gamma -> L-2+gamma+(beta+gamma')(e) -> L-3+gamma+(beta+gamma')(e)+gamma'->gamma+(beta+gamma')(e)+gamma', After the addition of 1 at.% Ti, there is no change in the segregation of elements, the microstructure and the solidification path of the alloy. The Ta element strongly segregates to the interdendritic regions in the Co-7Al-8W-1Ta alloy. With the addition of 4 at.% Ti, the Ti element strongly segregates to the interdendritic regions, and the segregation of Al and W elements increases. Blocky gamma' phase and (beta+y')(e) eutectics form in the interdendritic regions. The solidification path of the Co-7Al-8W-4Ti alloy is L -> L-1+gamma -> L-2+gamma+(beta+Y')(e) -> L-3+gamma+(beta+gamma')(e)+gamma' ->gamma+(beta+gamma')(e)+y', After the addition of 1 at.% Ta+4 at.% Ti, the segregation of Al, Ta and Ti decreases, while the segregation of W increases. Laves phase, blocky gamma' phase and ((beta+y')e eutectics form in the interdendritic regions. The solidification path of the Co-7A1-8W-1Ta-4Ti alloy is L -> L-1+gamma -> L-2+gamma+Laves -> L-3+gamma+Laves+(beta+gamma')(e) -> L-4+gamma+Laves+(beta+gamma')(e)+gamma' -> gamma+Laves+(beta+gamma')(e)+gamma'. The above results could provide an experimental basis for composition optimization and solidification process control of novel gamma'-strengthened Co-base superalloys. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

SO OCHRONA PRZED KOROZJA
AB Characterization of oxidation resistance of new type of cobalt based superalloys were presented in this investigations. As a referential material the Co-10Al-5Mo-2Nb (at.%) was used as the tungsten-free version of basic Co-7Al-7W alloy. The investigated alloy was modified by addition of yttrium on the level of 0.5 at.% due to expectation of improvement of it oxidation resistance. Both Co-based superalloys were casted in Institute of Materials Engineering of Silesian University of Technology in Poland. The oxidation performance of alloys were made during thermogravimetric investigations at temperature range from 25 to 1200 degrees C. The main analyzed parameter was mass gain detected continuously during the test. After the test the overall and cross-sectional analysis of specimens was made. They included analysis of oxide layer morphology on the surface of specimens with characterization of phase constituent of oxide layer. The detailed analysis of oxidized layer was made by scanning electron microscopy method where distribution of alloying elements was made with special attentions on yttrium localization after the test in oxide zone. Obtained data showed that addition of Y has a strong influence on oxidation performance of new Co based superalloy. Those influence is demonstrated mainly by different morphology of final oxide zone with strong influence on Mo and Nb diffusion.

TI Tensile Behavior and Evolution of the Phases in the
   Al10Co25Cr8Fe15Ni36Ti6 Compositionally Complex/High Entropy Alloy
SO ENTROPY
AB Compositionally complex alloys, or high entropy alloys, are good candidates for applications at higher temperatures in gas turbines. After their introduction, the equiatomic Al17Co17Cr17Cu17Fe17Ni17 (at.%) served as a starting material and a long optimization road finally led to the recently optimized Al10Co25Cr8Fe15Ni36Ti6 (at.%) alloy, which shows promising mechanical properties. Investigations of the as-cast state and after different heat treatments focus on the evolution of the microstructure and provide an overview of some mechanical properties. The dendritic solidification provides two phases in the dendritic cores and two different ones in the interdendritic regions. Three of the four phases remain after heat treatments. Homogenization and subsequent annealing produce a -' based microstructure, similar to Ni-based superalloys. The phase is Co-Cr-Fe rich and the ' phase is Al-Ni-Ti rich. The understanding of the mechanical behavior of the investigated alloy is supported and enhanced by the study of the different phases and their nanohardness measurements. The observations are compared with mechanical and microstructural data from commercial Ni-based superalloys, Co-based alloys, and Co-Ni-based alloys at the desired application temperature of similar to 800 degrees C.

AB A Co-Ni-based alloy strengthened by gamma'-(L1(2)) precipitates was utilized to investigate the precipitation evolution after various cooling rates and several aging conditions. In this study, the precipitate size and volume fraction have been studied via scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The influence of the precipitation evolution was measured via microhardness tests. The cooling rate study shows a more sluggish gamma' precipitation reaction compared to that observed in a Ni-based superalloy. Following a rapid cooling rate, the application of appropriate double aging treatments allows for the increase of the gamma' volume fraction as well as the control of the size and distribution of the precipitates. The highest hardness values reach those measured on supersolvus cast and wrought Ni-based superalloys. The observed gamma' precipitation behavior should have implications for the production, the heat treatment, the welding, or the additive manufacturing of this new class of high-temperature materials.

   MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Cobalt-based superalloy matrix composite materials were produced through the powder metallurgy technique using element powders at high purity and nano-sized wolfram carbide (WC) reinforcement in this study. An alloy that had the same chemical composition as the Stellite 6 alloy but not containing carbon was selected as the matrix alloy. The powder mixtures obtained as a result of mixing WC reinforcing member and element powders at the determined ratio were shaped by applying 300 MPa of pressure. The green components were sintered under argon atmosphere at 1240 A degrees C for 120 minutes. The densities of the sintered components were determined by the Archimedes' principle. Microstructural characterization was performed via X-ray diffraction analysis, scanning electron microscope examinations, and energy-dispersive spectrometry. Hardness measurements and tensile tests were performed for determining mechanical characteristics. The relative density values of the sintered components increased by increasing the WC reinforcement ratio and they could almost reach the theoretical density. It was determined from the microstructural examinations that the composite materials consisted of fine and equiaxed grains and coarse carbides demonstrating a homogeneous dispersion along the microstructure at the grain boundaries. As it was the case in the density values, the hardness and strength values of the composites increased by increasing the WC ratio.

AB Present paper concerns primary structure of new type of tungsten-free cobalt-based superalloys with formula Co-Al-Mo-Nb. Due to replacement of W by addition of Mo and Nb, the desirable dual phase structure of gamma/gamma' should be formed after heat treatment of this alloy. In analyzed case, the alloy in as cast state was described. The Co-10Al-5Mo-2Nb (at%) alloy was casted via induction melting process. The specimens were cut from "foot" area of the rod and analyzed from phases and chemical point of view by XRD and EDS analysis. Detailed analysis of primary microstructure by light and scanning microscopy observations were performed. Obtained data revealed that in as cast state, the main phases detected in the alloy were solid solution of Co(AI,Mo,Nb) and Mo with Nb reach precipitations, probably with formula of Co-3(Mo,Nb).

SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB A series of six alloys derived from a Ni-25Cr-0.4C-6Ta (wt.%) base one was developed by substituting nickel by cobalt. They were synthesized by casting and exposed to oxidative environment at two high temperatures. Their bulk microstructures were studied in as-cast condition and in two high temperature aged states. Their surfaces after oxidation during aging were characterized. The cobalt enrichment succeeded in avoiding chromium carbides formation and in stabilizing the TaC carbides at high temperature. As the high temperature morphologic stability of TaC was not perfect, it was much better than the one of the chromium carbides, but can be improved by the total removal of nickel. Unfortunately, at the same time, the oxidation behavior, initially good, shows increased rate of the oxides formation. The room temperature hardness was also significantly increased by the substitution of Ni by Co, and decreased after aging when carbides became rounder or fragmented. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

   fatigue of a polycrystalline nickel-based superalloy with different heat
   treatments
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FATIGUE
AB Gas turbine engine materials demand high performance of fatigue life under alternative loading. In this paper, crack initiation and propagation in the low cycle fatigue (LCF) of a polycrystalline nickel based superalloys was studied via experimental and numerical methods. LCF experiments were conducted with the specimens subjected to different heat treatment regimes, including of standard heat treatment (SHT), heat isostatic pressing (HIP), and combined heat treatment (HIP + SHT). Simulations based on finite element method (FEM) were implemented with the 3D digital model obtained from synchrotron radiation X-ray computerized tomography (CT) to investigate the effect of microporosity. Results indicated that microporosity was a dominant factor of fatigue crack and the parameters of microporosity including of porosity, effective diameter, and distribution co-contributed to affect fatigue life. The delta stack and carbide were observed to be fatigue crack sites. The HIP specimen had long fatigue cycle life since casting pore and acicular delta were eliminated, while further SHT can reintroduce delta into matrix resulting in high strength and low fatigue life. LCF crack behaviors in HIP + SHT superalloy depended on surface quality, stress concentration, and the quantity of carbide.

TI Investigation of Solidification and Segregation Characteristics of Cast
   Ni-Base Superalloy K417G
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis, isothermal solidification experiment and Thermo-Calc simulation were employed to investigate solidification characteristics of K417G Ni-base superalloy. Electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) was employed to analyze the segregation characteristics. Liquidus, solidus and the formation temperatures of main phases were measured. In the process of solidification, the volume fraction of liquid dropped dramatically in the initial stage, while the dropping rate became very low in the final stage due to severe segregation of positive segregation elements into the residual liquid. The solidification began with the formation of primary gamma. Then with solidification proceeding, Ti and Mo were enriched in the liquid interdendrite, which resulted in the precipitation of MC carbides in the interdendrite. Al accumulated into liquid at the initial stage, but gathered to solid later due to the precipitation of gamma/gamma' eutectic at the intermediate stage of solidification. However, Co tended to segregate toward the solid phase. In the case of K417G alloy, combining DSC analysis and isothermal solidification experiment is a good way to investigate the solidification characteristics. Thermo-Calc simulation can serve as reference to investigate K417G alloy. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The editorial office of Journal of Materials Science & Technology.

AB A novel polycrystalline nickel-based superalloy SLZhS-1R, heavily alloyed with Co+W and intended as a structural material for turbine blades in gas turbine engines, has been studied. The initial cast superalloy was prepared by vacuum induction melting in the form of an ingot with a size of empty set 100x180 mm. Compression and tensile tests were performed for the cast condition. Before compression testing, the superalloy was subjected to homogenization and heterogenization annealing, which led to an improvement of chemical homogeneity and coagulation of gamma' precipitates. As a result, the flow stresses during compression at elevated temperatures were reduced as compared to those obtained for the as-cast condition. Before the tensile testing, the superalloy was subjected to homogenization annealing (solution treatment) followed by air cooling and ageing. This improved the chemical homogeneity and led to the formation of fine gamma' precipitates with a size in the range of 0.1-0.2 mu m. The obtained mechanical properties in tension were compared with those of the typical cast superalloy ZhS6U.

AB Two cast and heat-treated NbC and TaC - strengthened cobalt superalloys have been developed for an investment casting of spinner discs for glass wool industry. In this work constant load creep tests in tension were carried out in argon atmosphere at three testing temperature 900, 950 and 1000 degrees C and at the initial applied stresses ranging from 40 to 200 MPa. All the tests were continued until the final fracture. The results of creep testing were combined with microstructural and fractographic examinations by means of light and scanning electron microscopy. A mutual comparison of creep characteristics of the investigated superalloys under comparable creep loading conditions showed that NbC-strengthened superalloy exhibited longer creep life than TaC-strengthened one. Further, it was found that carbide precipitation is the primary strengthening mechanism in both cobalt-base superalloys under investigation and the amount, morphology and type of carbides have the decisive effect on the creep properties including creep damage and fracture processes. By contrast, CoNb superalloy exhibited a more brittle character of creep fracture mode than CoTa superalloy due to a premature fracture. This study was initiated to investigate in more details operating creep deformation processes and the effect of the creep microstructure and damage evolution on both investigated superalloys. The different behaviour and properties of studied superalloys were explained based on the received results of this study.

CL Yinchuan, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB NiCr19Co6W10Ti3AlB alloy is a kind of precipitation hardening nickel-base superalloy, also is a kind of high temperature and high elasticity alloy. The chemical elements of the alloy composition is very complex, it includes more than 4.5% aging strengthening elements of Al and Ti, and nearly 37% solid solution strengthening elements of Cr, W, Co etc. Because of composition segregation in the alloy ingot, the difficulty of hot working is faced. In this paper, the composition segregation and homogenization annealing process of cast NiCr19Co6W10Ti3AlB alloy were studied. The dendrite segregation and its elimination method were investigated by homogenization annealing experiment. High temperature plastic deformation behavior of NiCr19Co6W10Ti3AlB alloy was also studied in this paper. By thermal simulation compression test, the thermal deformation behavior and microstructure change under different deformation conditions were analyzed, which provides a good reference for practical production.

CL Yinchuan, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB The effect of aluminum (Al) on microstructure, mechanical properties, solidification behavior, segregation and castability of a directionally solidified Ni-based superalloy was investigated. It was found that the dendrite arm spacing and volume fraction of carbides slightly decreased, while the volume fraction of the gamma/gamma' eutectic decreased distinctly with the decrease of Al content. When Al content reduced, the tensile properties at room temperature slightly decreased while the stress rupture life reduced significantly at 980 degrees C/235 MPa. The change of liquid volume fraction slightly reduced while the residual liquids were more inclined to remain thin continuous network form during the solidification in the alloy with low Al content. The segregation degree of Cr, Mo and W decreased with decreasing Al content, while Co, Al and Ta were more likely to segregate towards the interdendritic regions in the alloy with low Al content. The castability of alloy was getting worse with decreasing Al content.

TI Influence of High Current-Density Impulses on the Stress-Strain Response
   and Microstructural Evolution of the Single Crystal Superalloy CMSX-4
SO MATERIALS RESEARCH-IBERO-AMERICAN JOURNAL OF MATERIALS
AB Owing to the low formability of single-crystal nickel-based materials, single-crystal components are typically cast. Subsequently, a multi-stage heat treatment is carried out in order to partially compensate the dendrite segregation and to stabilize the precipitated gamma'-phase. Such components possess a high resistance to creep at elevated temperatures. Since it is known that electrical impulses can be used to increase the formability of various materials, the potential of an electrical high current-density impulse treatment was evaluated for forming of the high strength nickel-based superalloy CMSX-4. Heat treated and pre-deformed specimens were loaded in compression and subjected to short pulses with a high-current density of 2.3 kA/mm(2). Depending on the microstructural state, the material demonstrated work hardening or softening as a consequence of the impulse treatment. In addition, experiments were carried out on crept specimens to test whether the current-impulse treatment can be used to reverse creep-related segregation of alloying elements (raft formation). It was possible to observe a change in the concentration of the elements in the gamma/ gamma'-phase transition following the current-impulse treatment. In particular, a local increase in the gamma-forming elements Cr, Co and a decrease in the gamma'-forming elements Ta, Ti was observed after the impulse treatment.

TI Microstructure of Co-base superalloy prepared by a investment casting
SO JOURNAL OF THE KOREAN CRYSTAL GROWTH AND CRYSTAL TECHNOLOGY
AB The microstructure of a cobalt-base superalloy (ECY768) obtained by an investment casting process was studied. This work focuses on the resulting microstructures arising from different melt and mold temperatures in normal industrial environmental conditions. The characterization of the samples was carried out using optical microscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive spectroscopy. In this study, the as-cast microstructure is an alpha-Co (face-centered cubic) dendritic matrix with the presence of a secondary phase, such as M23C6-type carbides precipitated at grain boundaries. These precipitates are the main strengthening mechanism in this type of alloy. Other minority phases, such as the MC-type phase, was also detected and their presence could be linked to the manufacturing process and environment.

TI Effect of Directional Solidification Variables on the Microstructures of
   Single-Crystal Turbine Blades of Nickel-Based Superalloy
SO ADVANCED ENGINEERING MATERIALS
AB Single-crystal turbine blades of nickel-based superalloy are directionally solidified at different withdrawal rates of 0.0017 cm s(-1)-0.01 cm s(-1) aiming to investigate the evolution of as-cast microstructures. The results show that the average primary and secondary dendrite arm spacings,.1 and.2, decrease with increasing withdrawal rate, although the complicated geometry of the blades results in local nonhomogeneity of dendrite arm spacings. The experimentally achieved values of.1 can be reasonably predicted by Ma and Sahm's theoretical model, in which the effect of the secondary dendrite on the primary dendrite arm spacing is considered. With increasing withdrawal rate, the shape of the g/ g0 eutectic varies from a large block-like eutectic island to an interconnected small strip-like morphology. In addition to this, the average size of the g/ g0 eutectic gradually decreases with increasing withdrawal rate. A reduction in the average sizes of the g0 precipitates in the dendrite core and interdendritic region is also observed with increasing withdrawal rate. The microsegregation levels of Al, Ti, Ta, Cr, Co, and Mo are alleviated with increasing withdrawal rate.

TI Large-scale simulation of dendrite growth in directional solidification
   castings
SO PHYSICA STATUS SOLIDI B-BASIC SOLID STATE PHYSICS
AB In this study, the growth and distribution of directional solidification (DS) dendrites in entire cross-sections of DS superalloy castings are simulated based on a modified shape function dendritic (MSFD) model coupled with the cellular automaton-finite difference (CA-FD) method. The macro-thermal transfer and columnar grain growth are calculated using CA-FD with a macro time-step, and then, the original and boundary conditions for the dendrite-growth simulation are determined via the interpolation of the macro temperature and the projection of the 3D preferential grain orientation using a matrix, M. The dendrite growth calculation cyclically proceeds based on the MSFD model. It is used to predict the growth of hundreds of dendrites throughout the cross-section of a DS casting by considering the macro-solidification parameters. The MSFD model is further applied to predict the competitive growth of DS dendrites and their distribution in the cross-sections of a spiral selector and a fake single crystal turbine blade. The results of the simulation correlate with the results of the DS experiment. Hence, the modified model coupled with the macro-simulation models can be used to predict the morphology and distribution of DS dendrites with respect to large-scale castings produced by the DS process.

TI Effect of V on Hot Corrosion Behavior of K417G Alloy at 900 degrees C
SO RARE METAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING
AB The effect of V on hot corrosion behavior of cast Ni-base superalloy K417G exposed to 75%Na2SO4 +25%NaCl at 900 degrees C for 100 h has been investigated by thermogravimetry (TG) and scanning electron microscopy equipped with energy dispersive X-ray spectrum (EDS), and corrosion resistance was obtained by measuring the polarization curve at 900 degrees C. The results show that the hot corrosion rate of the alloy with 0.016% V content is almost unchanged, the hot corrosion rate of alloy increases with the increase of V content, but the hot corrosion rate of alloy with 1.19% V content is 100 times more than that of the low V alloy. The corrosion product on the surface of K417G alloys is found to be composed of oxides and sulfides. The oxides consist of Al, Cr, Co, Ti and Ni, while the sulfides include NiS, MoS and NiCrS. With the content of V content increasing, S element diffuses toward to interlayer, and the layer of Al2O3 and Cr2O3 becomes thinner; hence the inner sulfides layer formed in the alloy with 1.19% V decreases the corrosion resistance. Compared with the alloy with 1.19% V, the corrosion potential of the alloy with 0.016% V shifts 0.4 V toward positive direction, and the corrosion resistance is better than that alloy with high V content.

SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB H13 steel is the primary choice for the material of Aluminum Die casting molds. The life of these tools is usually enhanced by the application of WC-Co coating using electro spark deposition (ESD) process. The objective of this study is to establish the effect of ESD process parameters including voltage, duty cycle, and frequency on the characteristics of WC-Co coating on H13 steel. Design of experiment technique Was used and coating thickness, coating hardness, and occurrence of defects in the coatings were studied. The results indicated that coating cracking at low spark energy is different from that at high spark energy. Moreover, it was found that by increasing spark energy, coating hardness and thickness increases. It is also shown that process parameters have interactive effects on the coating features and there is an optimum condition for achieving a sound coating. The maximum coating hardness was obtained at high spark energies. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Studies of the interfacial structure of a linear friction welded Fe/Ni
   joint: First principles calculation and TEM validation
SO MATERIALS CHARACTERIZATION
AB In this work, the interfacial structure of a linear friction welded (LFWed) Fe/Ni joint was studied using CASTEP based on first principles. Calculations clearly show that the Fe(100)/Ni(100) structure is the most stable bonding structure at the Fe/Ni interface, where 3d orbital electrons have a significant contribution to the interface bond and the Fe(3d)-Ni(3d) bond displays a strong covalent bonding effect. Transmission electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy were used to evaluate the LFWed Fe/Ni interface. The experimental results show that the stable bonding structure appears at the weld edge and the orientation is (100)(Fe)//(100)(Ni) [010](Fe)//[011](Ni), as predicted by calculations. While at the weld center orientation is (011)(Fe)//(10 (1) over bar)(Ni), [100] (Fe)//[11 (2) over bar](Ni) due to lattice distortion.

TI Correlative characterization on microstructure evolution of Ni-based
   K403 alloy during thermal exposure
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB The microstructure evolution of the K403 Ni-based superalloy as a function of thermal exposure temperature and time was investigated using correlative characterization, including a combination of scanning electron microscopy, electron backscatter diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, high angle angular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy imaging and electron energy loss spectroscopy. The as-cast microstructure of the K403 alloy shows a typical dendritic structure and consists of a gamma solid solution, gamma' phase, (gamma + gamma') eutectic phase and a metal carbide (MC) phase. The solutes of Ni and Ti are enriched in the gamma solid solution, while, the solutes of Cr and Co are enriched in the gamma' phase. The morphology of the y' phase is nearly cubic. After thermal exposure at 800 degrees C or 950 degrees C for up to 200 h, the typical dendritic structure and a similar solute segregation behavior were still observed. However, the MC carbides were partially decomposed and further transformed to the M6C phase and M23C6 phase. Furthermore, the size of y' was increased from 302.88 +/- 20.49 nm to 374.75 +/- 29.76 nm (800 degrees C, 50 h) and 751.73 +/- 123.14 nm (950 degrees C, 50 h), respectively. The morphology of y' was changed from cubic to triangular or round. Clearly, there is a significant coarsening of y' during thermal exposure. A topologically close-packed (TCP) a phase was observed after thermal exposure at 800 degrees C for 100 h or 950 C for 50 h. More interestingly, an in-situ phase transformation of the a phase to other TCP phase (i.e. P phase) was also observed after thermal exposure at 950 degrees C for 50 h. The formation and transformation of carbide (i.e. M6C phase, M23C6 phase) and TCP phases (i.e. a phase, P phase) is proposed to be a diffusion-controlled process and can be attributed to the solute diffusion during thermal exposure. The present investigation provides a better understanding on the high temperature performance of the K403 Ni-based superalloy, which is essential to predict the failure and thereby enhance the reliability and service life of the K403 Ni-based superalloy.

TI Development of Low Segregation Technology
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB The minor element in alloy greatly aggravate the segregation of main elements and formation of harmful phase, resulting the deterioration of mechanical properties. Low segregation technology of cast superalloy was pioneered by Prof. Shi Changxu and co-workers in the early eighties. The technology is to control the content of minor element, such as P, Si, B and Zr, to lower the solidification segregation in the super-alloy. The working temperature and mechanical properties of superalloy can be increased greatly by using the low segregation technology. A series of alloys, such as M17 and GH738 with low segregation and excellent properties, had been developed. This study extends low segregation technology to 30Cr2Ni4MoV steel of large shaft for thermal power equipment, 690 alloy for steam generator tube in nuclear power plant, and uranium alloy for nuclear fuel. The solidification and segregation behaviour in the 30Cr2Ni4MoV steel was investigated, it is found that the minor elements of O and Al are essential for the formation of serious solidification segregation in the steel. Moreover, the solidification behavior of 690 alloy has been studied. S and N increases solidification interval, and the effect of S is greater than that of N. The solidification segregation of 690 alloy can be alleviated by controlling the contents of the S and N. Finally, the solidification temperature interval of high carbon uranium is calculated. With the carbon content increasing from 0.01% to 0.03%, the solidification interval is from 40 degrees C to 75 degrees C. Thus, for the radioactive uranium alloys, minor elements show segregation to some extent in the residual liquids of final solidification zone. The minor elements in U-6Nb alloy are C, N and O. For uranium with high carbon content, the minor elements are C and O.

TI Effect of Ru on the Solidification Microstructure of a Ni-Based Single
   Crystal Superalloy with High Cr Content
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB Ni-based single crystal superalloys have been widely used in manufacturing the critical components of aero-engines, such as turbine blades and vanes. Improvements in phase stability on the addition of Ru are well known in the field of Ni-based superalloy development. Cr is beneficial to hot corrosion resistance of Ni-based superalloys. Generally, superalloys which used under easy corrosion conditions should contain high levels of Cr. Early researches about the influence of Ru on solidification microstructures in Ni-based single crystal alloys are mostly focused on low-Cr systerms (<6%). Since Cr has complex interactions with Ru, it is meanful to study the effects of Ru on solidification microstructures in high-Cr (>10%) Ni-based single crystal superalloy systems. The materials used in this work are Ni-based single crystal superalloy with high Cr content. Three superalloys by changing Ru addition (0, 1.5%, 3%, mass fraction) were designed. By observing the as-cast structure, the effect of Ru on the elements distribution and the precipitation characters of different phases in these alloys were studied. It is found that as the Ru content increases, the primary and secondary dendrite arm spacings decrease gradually; the volume fraction of (gamma+gamma') eutectic increases firstly and then decreases; the gamma' size is reduced progressively. The addition of 3% Ru leads to the formation of beta-NiAl phase, which contain a certain amount of Cr, Co and Ru except the basic elements Ni and Al. The typical "reverse partitioning" of other alloying elements is exhibited with the addition of Ru, while the formation of b-NiAl phase can reduce the "reverse partitioning" of other alloying elements. The addition of Ru could enhance the segregation of positive segregation elements Ta, Al and negative segregation element Re while reduce the segregation of positive segregation elements Mo and Cr.

TI Towards understanding the effects of magnesium addition on
   microstructural and thermal properties of NiAlCr alloys in as-cast and
   heat treated states
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB The effects of magnesium addition on the microstructure, hardness, chemical composition and thermal expansion coefficient of NiAlCr alloys in as-cast and heat-treated states were studied. NiAlCr alloys containing 1, 2.5 and 3.8 at.% Mg were prepared via atmosphere-controlled induction melting following vacuum arc melting. According to the XRD results, as-cast alloys were mainly composed of martensite, beta-NiAl and gamma'-Ni3Al. High amounts of Mg in alloys resulted in a slight increase in CTE. Increasing Mg also changed the morphology of the interdendritic Ni3Al phase from continuous network to discontinuous structure, resulting in Ni2Mg precipitates with hardness of 1280 HV0.002. In the furnace cooling procedure following the annealing procedure at 1050 degrees C for 96 h, martensite completely transformed into beta-NiAl with alpha-Cr precipitates. The single phase Ni3Al transformed into Al0.9Ni4.22-Ni3Al lamellar structure and Ni2Mg phase disappeared. The presence of Mg in solid solution did not influence CTE of the alloys.

TI Effect of alloy composition on the oxidation-induced boron depletion in
   cast Ni-base superalloy components
SO MATERIALS AND CORROSION-WERKSTOFFE UND KORROSION
AB The high temperature air oxidation of the two conventionally cast Ni-based superalloys Rene 80 containing 92wtppm boron and CM 247 containing 110wtppm of boron was studied at temperatures between 850 and 1050 degrees C and times ranging from 1 to 100h. Analysis by GD-OES and SEM/WDX/EBSD revealed the surface scale on Rene 80 after exposure at 1050 degrees C to consist of Cr2O3 with TiO2 in the outer part and BCrO3 and CrTi2O5 in the inner part. Internal Al2O3 precipitates were present below the external scale. After 1h exposure of CM 247 an inner dense alumina scale formed over eutectic alloy regions containing coarse precipitates. Over dendritic regions a Cr-rich oxide scale with BCrO3-precipitates formed initially and aluminum was internally oxidized. After longer oxidation times an alumina sub-scale grew from the internal precipitates, and oxidation of the initially present depleted alloy zones resulted in formation of outer Ni and Co rich oxides. In both alloys, boron depletion in the bulk alloy occurred due to formation of the mentioned boron rich oxide. The extent of depletion was substantially higher for the chromia forming Rene 80 than for CM 247. In the latter material the boron depletion was suppressed after the formation of the dense, inner alumina scale.

TI Thermomechanical behavior of intermetallic Ni-Al-Co and Ti-Al-Nb based
   alloys during isothermal deformation
SO LETTERS ON MATERIALS-PIS MA O MATERIALAKH
AB Different plastic deformation thermo-mechanical terms were tried out on Ni-Al-Co-based alloy in cast, prepressed and deformed conditions, and on Ti-Al-Nb-based alloy in cast and deformed conditions by yielding specimens with varying rate of deformation in interval between 10 and 70 % and varying deformation temperature in interval between 900 and 1200 degrees.. Diagrams of tensile strength and elongation upon temperature dependence in Ni-Al-Co-based alloy in cast prepressed and deformed conditions and Ti-Al-Nb-based alloy in cast and deformed conditions are designed. Application features of protective technological coating based on glass enamel in isothermal forging of workpiece are examined. The results of heatresistance tests on Ni-Al-Co and Ti-Al-Nb-based alloys coated with different compositions of protection technological coating are shown. During the deformation these technological coatings have to be high temperature lubricant, that reduce force up to two times, necessary to deform workpiece. These protection technological coatings can be used at temperatures under 1250 degrees. The results of the work show, that optimal temperature for deformation intermetallic Ni-Al-Co-based superaloy workpiece were between 1140 and 1160 degrees.. Dropping temperature below 1140 degrees. leads to crack growing because of significant reduction of ductility. The results of the work show, that optimal temperature for deformation intermetallic Ti-Al-Nb-based workpiece were between 1150 and 1200 degrees.

TI The Minor Precipitation at the Final Stage of U720Li Solidification
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA-ENGLISH LETTERS
AB The minor precipitations caused by B and Zr which are the normal constituents of U720Li alloy have been studied by analyzing the solidification process and the composition evolution. The present study aims to supply the elementary information about the existing form of B and Zr in the as-cast microstructure, which is helpful for the subsequent processing, such as homogenization treatment. The M3B2 and Ni5Zr phases were observed in the U720Li alloy in as-cast state, which were usually accompanying with each other together with eta-Ni3Ti phase at the edge of eutectic (gamma + gamma'). Combining the DTA analysis and heating and quenching tests, the solidification sequence was determined to be the following: gamma matrix, eutectic (gamma + gamma'), eta-Ni3Ti, M3B2 and Ni5Zr. The in situ composition analysis by EDS and EPMA revealed that the precipitation and microstructure were governed by the composition evolution in the liquids. The solidification of gamma matrix increased the Ti concentration in the residual liquids and resulted in the eutectic (gamma + gamma') formation; the (gamma + gamma') formation increased the Ti/Al radio in the liquids and the eta-Ni3Ti was formed in front of the eutectic (gamma + gamma'); the eta-Ni3Ti precipitation consumed up Al and Ti and increased the concentration of B, Mo and Cr, and M3B2 boride is formed; the previous precipitation of the phases consumed up most of the elements other than Ni and Zr, and Ni5Zr is formed finally. The melting points are in the ranges of 1130-1140 degrees C for Ni5Zr phase, 1180-1190 degrees C for M3B2 boride and 1190-1200 degrees C for eta-Ni3Ti phase.

TI Effects of grain refinement on cast structure and tensile properties of
   superalloy K4169 at high pouring temperature
SO CHINA FOUNDRY
AB In order to improve the filling ability of large complex thin wall castings, the pouring temperature should be increased, but this will result in the grain coarsening. To overcome this problem, two kinds of grain refiners of Co-Fe-Nb and Cr-Fe-Nb ternary alloys, which contain high stability compound particles, were prepared. The effects of the refiners on the as-cast structures and tensile properties of the K4169 superalloy with different casting conditions were studied by analyzing specimens 110 mm long and 20 mm in diameter. Results showed that the mixture addition of the two refiners in the melt of K4169 can reduce the columnar grain region and decrease the equiaxed grain size greatly. After refinement, the amount of Laves phase decreases and its morphology changes from island to blocky structure. The carbides in the fine grain samples are fine and dispersive. Meanwhile, the porosity in specimens is decreased due to grain refinement. As a result, the yield strength, ultimate strength and the elongation of the specimens are increased. The grain refinement mechanisms are also discussed.

TI M5B3 Boride at the Grain Boundary of a Nickel-based Superalloy
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB The grain boundary microstructures of a heat-treated Ni-based cast superalloy IN792 were investigated. The results show that M5B3 boride precipitates at the grain boundary. A special orientation relationship between M5B3 phase and the matrix at one side of the grain boundary is found. At the same time, two M5B3 borides with different orientations could co-exist in a single M5B3 particle as an intergrowth besides existing alone, thus forming orientation relationship between the two M5B3 phases and matrix. This phenomenon could be attributed to the special orientation relationship between M5B3 phase and the matrix. Copyright (C) 2015, The editorial office of Journal of Materials Science & Technology.

TI The thermal stability of topologically close-packed phases in the
   single-crystal Ni-base superalloy ERBO/1
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB In Ni-base superalloys, the addition of refractory elements such as Cr, Mo, Co, W, and Re is necessary to increase the creep resistance. Nevertheless, these elements induce the formation of different kinds of intermetallic phases, namely, the topologically close-packed (TCP) phases. This work focuses on intermetallic phases present in the second-generation single-crystal (SX) Ni-base superalloy ERBO/1. In the as-cast condition, the typical gamma/gamma' structure is accompanied by undesirable intermetallic phases located in the interdendritic regions. The nature of these precipitates as well as their thermal stability between 800 and 1200 A degrees C has been investigated by isothermal heat treatments. The investigation techniques include DSC, SEM, EDX, and TEM. The experimental information is complemented by (1) comparison with a structure map to link the local chemical composition with phase stability, as well as (2) thermodynamic calculations based on the CALPHAD method to determine the occurrence and composition of phases during solidification and in equilibrium conditions. The TCP phases Laves, A mu and sigma were identified in various temperature/time ranges.

TI EFFECT OF SOLID SOLUTION TREATMENT ON MICROSTRUCTURE AND MECHANICAL
   PROPERTIES OF HOT-PRESS CoCrW ALLOYS
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB Co-based alloy has high strength, good corrosion and wear resistance, and is widely used in aviation industry, nuclear industry. The cast Co-based alloys has high hardness brittleness, but the toughness is low, which limits its wide use. The CoCrW alloy prepared by powder metallurgy process has high toughness, at the same time, the mechanical properties of the CoCrW alloy can be changed by heat treatment. In this work, the effect of solid solution treatment on the microstructure and mechanical properties of the hot pressed alloy was studied by SEM, XRD and TEM, hardness test, room-temperature tensile and wear experiment. The results show that the microstructure of the as-hot pressed and solid solution state CoCrW alloy are both composed of M23C6, M6C, CrCo intermetallic compounds and gamma-Co matrix, the contents of M23C6 and prior particle boundaries decrease remarkably after solution treatment, meanwhile, the toughness and wear resistance of the alloy are improved. With the increase of solid solution temperature and time, the hardness and tensile strength at room temperature of CoCrW alloys increase first and then decrease.

TI STUDY ON THE PRECIPITATION AND DISSOLUTION OF sigma PHASE IN A HOT
   CORROSION RESISTANCE CAST NICKLE BASE SUPERALLOY
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB The experimental alloy is designed and employed in high-performance industrial gas turbines as low-pressure turbine blades, working in temperature range of 750 similar to 900 degrees C. The alloy contains high levels of refractory elements in order to increase the high-temperature mechanical properties. However, this can make the alloy prone to the formation of sigma phase during service, which could deteriorate the properties further if the fraction of sigma phase exceeds the safety allowances. In this study, the formation of sigma phase during long-term thermal exposure, dissolution of the sigma phase during rejuvenation process and their influence on stress-rupture properties of a hot-corrosion resistant nickel base superalloy have been investigated. During long-term thermal exposure at 800 similar to 900 degrees C for up to 1 x 10(4) h, the sigma phase formation is mainly in dendrite cores with a few at interdendritic regions. As the aging temperature increases, the precipitation rate of sigma phase increases and the incubation time for nucleation of sigma phase decreases. From the kinetic analysis, the sigma phase form firstly in the vicinity or on the M23C6 in dendrite cores with the strong segregation of W, Cr and Co. The calculated activation energies of a formation show that the early stage is related to Co and Cr diffusions and the steady stage is related to Mo diffusion. During solid solution process at 1000 similar to 1170 degrees C the sigma phase precipitated during long-term thermal exposure dissolves to gamma matrix. As the solid solution temperature is higher, the dissolution of a phase becomes faster. Moreover, the sigma phase does not embrittle the alloy. The reheat treatment of the alloy leads to the dissolution of precipitated sigma phase and further prolongs the stress-rupture life efficiently.

SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB The purpose of this study was to produce Co-based Stellite 6 superalloy components by using the method of Powder Injection Molding (PIM) and to characterize the microstructural and mechanical properties of the produced components. The experimental studies were started through the formation of feedstock by mixing Stellite 6 powder with a multicomponent binder system. Prepared feedstock was formed by utilizing powder injection molding technique. Then the molded samples were subjected to the solvent and thermal debinding processes. Different sintering cycles were applied to the raw components for the purpose of determining the optimum sintering conditions. The densities of the sintered components were determined in accordance with the Archimedes' principle. The microstructural characterization was performed through scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis, energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) analyses, and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. Hardness measurement and tensile test were conducted in order to determine the mechanical properties. The results illustrated that the injection molded Stellite 6 components were composed of fine and equiaxed grains, plenty of carbide precipitates exhibiting homogenous distribution throughout the microstructure formed at the grain boundaries and thus the mechanical properties were considerably high.

TI Comparative study of the segregation behavior and crystallographic
   orientation in a nickel-based single-crystal superalloy
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB The segregation behavior and crystallographic orientation of a nickel-based single-crystal CMSX-6 superalloy produced by the downward directional solidification process have been investigated. The results were compared with those in the Bridgman process. In comparison to the Bridgman process, the fluctuations in the concentrations of Al, Ti, Ta, Co, Mo and Cr became smaller along the path from the dendrite lobe through the interdendritic region to the adjacent dendrite lobe. This suggests that the degree of the segregation of these alloying elements was reduced by using the DWDS process. In addition to this, the angle between the dendrites' preferred growth direction and the heat flow direction in the DWDS cast samples, and the splaying region were smaller than those in the Bridgman solidified samples. This indicates that better crystal orientation can be obtained in nickel-based single-crystal superalloy components by using the downward directional solidification process. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB The advanced cast & wrought (C&W) superalloys for turbine disc applications have low temperature bearing capacity and poor processing ability compared with the powder metallurgy (PM) superalloys. Recently, a new kind of C&W Ni-Co base disc superalloys, named as TMW alloy, has been developed on the basis of an innovative concept. Full-scale pancakes (440 mm in diameter and 65 mm in thickness) with an average grain size of about 10 pm were successfully manufactured by a conventional C&W processing route. TMW alloys can provide 58-76 degrees C temperature advantages over alloy U720Li in 0.2% creep strain life under 630 MPa and are comparable with the advanced PM disc superalloys. In this work, the alloy design, preparation processing capacity, micro-structural control, performance characteristics and deformation strengthening mechanisms were briefly introduced.

TI Microsegregation and precipitates of an as-cast Co-based
   superalloy-microstructural characterization and phase stability
   modelling
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB The demand for increased efficiency of industrial gas turbines and aero engines drives the search for the next generation of materials. Promising candidates for such new materials are Co-based superalloys. We characterize the microsegregation and solidification of a multi-component Co-based superalloy and compare it to a ternary Co-Al-W compound and to two exemplary Ni-based superalloys by combining the experimental characterization of the as-cast microstructures with complementary modelling of phase stability. On the experimental side, we characterize the microstructure and precipitates by electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and determine the element distributions and microsegregation coefficients by electron probe microanalysis (EPMA). On the modelling side, we carry out solidification simulations and a structure map analysis in order to relate the local chemical composition with phase stability. We find that the microsegregation coefficients for the individual elements are very similar in the investigated Co-based and Ni-based superalloys. By interpreting the local chemical composition from EPMA with the structure map, we effectively unite the set of element distribution maps to compound maps with very good contrast of the dendritic microstructure. The resulting compound maps of the microstructure in terms of average band filling and atomic-size difference explain the formation of topologically close-packed phases in the interdendritic regions. We identify B2, C14, and D0(24) precipitates with chemical compositions that are in line with the structure map.

TI Isothermal aging of a gamma '-strengthened Co-Al-W alloy coated with
   vacuum plasma-sprayed MCrAlY bond coats
SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB Cobalt-based superalloys with a gamma/gamma' microstructure were discovered in 2006 and are currently being investigated as an alternative to nickel-based superalloys for high-temperature, high-load applications in gas turbine blades. They promise a better castability combined with a similar creep strength. Superalloy turbine blades are commonly coated with oxidation resistant bond coats. For this reason their compatibility needs to be studied. Co-9Al-9W specimens with a gamma/gamma' microstructure were coated with either a nickel-based or cobalt-based MCrAlY bond coat using vacuum plasma spraying. After aging at 900 degrees C in air for up to 500 h no decomposition of the gamma' phase was found in the bulk superalloy. The interdiffusion zone shows several different W-rich topologically close-packed phases arising from the dissolution of the gamma' phase in this region. The W-rich phases are identified to be mu phase for both bond coats and R phase for the nickel-based bond coat only. Their total volume is higher for the nickel-based bond coat. Therefore the cobalt-based bond coat is better suited for the Co-based superalloy substrate. Room temperature hardness and Young's modulus were measured using nanoindentation in the initial state and after heat treatment. A significantly higher Young's modulus was found for the cobalt-based bond coat (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI The Thermal Stability of Intermetallic Compounds in an As-Cast SX
   Co-Base Superalloy
SO ADVANCED ENGINEERING MATERIALS
AB The nature and stability of intermetallic phases in a multi-component / Co-base superalloy is investigated. At least three kinds of unwanted intermetallic phases form due to the segregation of Al, Ta, Ti, Si, and Hf during casting in the interdendritic areas in addition to and . One of the intermetallic phases that shows a blocky shape, contains high content of Ta, Hf, and Ti and has been identified as a topologically close-packed Laves phase. A B2 phase appears as relatively big pools and in some cases contains needle-shaped precipitates with high content of Al and Ti. The thermal stability of these intermetallic phases is studied in this work under defined heat treatments. The needle-shaped precipitates already dissolve at 1000 degrees C, whereas the B2 phase is dissolved only at higher temperatures of 1200 degrees C. Small amounts of Laves phases remained stable during aging at 1200 degrees C for 25h. The prediction of phases as well as their stability is also checked by the CALPHAD method. The TCNi5 database, containing the description of Co-3(Al,W), predicts the presence of the observed intermetallic phases; however, the predicted main transformation temperatures for these phases differ from the experimentally obtained values.

AB The as-cast Co-Cr-Mo alloy (ASTM F75) has been widely used as biomaterial in orthopaedic implant because of its excellent mechanical properties, good corrosion resistance and biocompatibility. However, some defects such as porosity and pinhole in an as-cast make some problems for application. Therefore in this study, the cobalt-aluminate (CoAl2O4) used as an inoculant during coating plays to refine the grain size and to reduce the porosity and pinhole content in an as-cast. Therefore, the effect of an inoculant addition on defect content, microstructure and mechanical properties of as-cast Co-Cr-Mo alloy has been investigated. The mechanical properties of the Co-Cr-Mo alloy were improved by addition of an inoculant.

TI Advanced Scale Bridging Microstructure Analysis of Single Crystal
   Ni-Base Superalloys
SO ADVANCED ENGINEERING MATERIALS
AB In the present work, we show how conventional and advanced mechanical, chemical, and microstructural methods can be used to characterize cast single crystal Ni-base superalloy (SX) plates across multiple length scales. Two types of microstructural heterogeneities are important, associated with the castmicrostructure (dendrites (D) and interdendritic (ID) regions - large scale heterogeneity) and with the well-known gamma/gamma' microstructure (small scale heterogeneity). Using electron probe microanalysis (EPMA), we can show that elements such as Re, Co, and Cr partition to the dendrites while ID regions contain more Al, Ta, and Ti. Analytical transmission electron microscopy and atom probe tomography (APT) show that Al, Ta, and Ti partition to the gamma' cubes while gamma channels show higher concentrations of Co, Cr, Re, and W. We can combine large scale (EPMA) and small-scale analytical methods (APT) to obtain reasonable estimates for gamma' volume fractions in the dendrites and in the ID regions. The chemical and mechanical properties of the SX plates studied in the present work are homogeneous, when they are determined from gamma' volumes with dimensions, which are significantly larger than the dendrite spacing. For the SX plates (140 mm x 100 mm x 20 mm) studied in the present work this holds for the average chemical composition as well as for elastic behavior and local creep properties. We highlight the potential of HRTEM and APT to contribute to a better understanding of the role of dislocations during coarsening of the gamma' phase and the effect of cooling rates after high temperature exposure on the microstructure.

TI Oxidation Behavior of the Niobium-Modified MAR-M247 Superalloy at 1,000
   A degrees C in Air
SO OXIDATION OF METALS
AB MAR-M247 superalloy has excellent mechanical properties and oxidation resistance. The aim of this work was to evaluate the oxidation behavior of a Nb-modified MAR-M247 superalloy (10.2 wt% Co; 10.2 W; 8.5 Cr; 5.6 Al; 1.6 Nb; 1.4 Hf; 1.1 Ti; 0.7 Mo; 0.15 C; 0.06 Zr; 0.02 B; Ni balance). The samples were subjected to oxidation tests in air at 1,000 A degrees C up to 240 h and the weight gain was measured every 24 h. The material in the as-cast condition as well as those from the oxidation tests were characterized with the aid of SEM/EDS and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The results showed that the n value and the parabolic rate constant (k) for the MAR-M247(Nb) superalloy at 1,000 A degrees C were about 0.1 and 2.8 x 10(-8) mg(2)cm(-4)s(-1), respectively. The microstructural characterization showed the formation of NiO oxides in the outer layer, Cr2O3, TiO2, CoO, (Ni,Co)Cr2O4 spinels, W20O58 and HfO2 particles in the intermediate layer and Al2O3 in the inner layer and in the gamma' depleted zone of the material.

TI The effect of Co on the microstructure and stress rupture properties of
   a single crystal superalloy
SO MATERIALS RESEARCH INNOVATIONS
AB The influence of cobalt (Co) on the as-cast microstructure of an Ni-based single crystal superalloy and its chemical segregation, incipient melting temperature and stress rupture properties was investigated. The results show that the dendrite arm spacing in the alloy did not vary with the addition of Co. The gamma' size in the as-cast microstructure decreased with increasing Co content. The segregation ratio of the gamma'-forming elements titanium (Ti) and tantalum (Ta) became higher in alloys with high Co content (5%, 10%), while the segregation ratio of the gamma-forming elements chromium (Cr) and molybdenum (Mo) first increased then decreased with increasing Co content, attaining the minimum around 10% Co. The incipient melt temperature decreased with increasing Co content. The stress rupture life under 1010 degrees C/248 MPa increased with the increasing of Co content up to 10%, but decreased at 15% Co. The related mechanisms are also discussed in this paper.

TI Microstructural Evolution of a Ni-base Alloy DZ468 Joint Bonded with a
   New Co-base Filler
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Ni-base alloy DZ468 has been joined by transient liquid phase bonding technique with a newly developed Co-based filler. The microstructures of the Co-base filler and the joint, the effects of heat treatment on microstructure and hardness of the joint have been investigated by various experimental methods. Results show that the Co-base filler consists of gamma, M2B, M5B3 and M23B6 phases. Because of the interdiffusion between the base metal and the filler, gamma, MC, M5B3 and M23B6 phases are formed in the bonding zone. And localized liquidation of substrate occurs in the diffusion affected zone, with MC and M3B2 precipitating in this area. During heat treatment, the volume of the intermetallic phases in the bonding zone resulting from incomplete isothermal solidification decreases obviously. On the contrary, the width of the diffusion affected zone increases at the solution stage and subsequently decreases at the aging stages.

AB In this study, a new boron and silicon free braze alloy, based on Ni-Co-Zr-Hf-Cr-Ti-Al, was used to repair IN 738 superalloy employing a wide gap brazing (WGB) process under two process conditions. It was found that using a combination of Hf and Zr primarily as melting point depressants the amount of each melting point depressant (MPD) could effectively be reduced while still achieving a relatively low liquidus. During WGB process, the new braze alloy was able to bond IN 738 filler powder particles to each other and to the substrate cast IN 738 and achieve defect :free joint. The microstructure analysis showed the presence of Zr-containing phase(s) remained in WGB joint, however, the hardness of the Zr-containing phase(s) was similar to that of superalloy substrate. Extended brazing cycle had limited effect on reducing the Zr-containing phase(s); rather it encouraged the formation of larger eutectic gamma/gamma' phases.

AB The 60 Hz, Frame 7F engine has been in commercial operation for more than two decades now with approximately 800 Frame 7 (F, FA, FA+ and FA+e models) machines existing in North America and a total of over 1100 F-class machines throughout the world. Of importance to operators/users and owners of this gas turbine engine is the ability to not only recondition the turbine "hot-end section" components, in order to support maintenance requirements, but also to reduce the life cycle costs of these components.
   Stage 1 nozzles are a cast doublet, manufactured from FSX-414 Co-based superalloy. There are 24 nozzles in an engine set. As a result of the extreme turbine inlet temperatures at the 1st stage nozzle, these components experience severe thermal fatigue cracking. On one particular OEM engine set inspected, over 600 cracks were identified on each nozzle after engine operation. As a consequence, the stage 1 nozzles when compared to the other components in the engine exhibits the worst degradation and is therefore a focus point of reconditioning for those in the industry.
   The technical objective is to describe the development of a repair scheme for the stage 1 nozzle that can successfully address and repair this level of severe cracking and oxidation, with 0% scrap/fallout for a heavy repair, after a normal duty cycle. Special processes have been established for these components repairs, including but not limited to removal of the damaged and oxidized trailing edges by machining, high frequency Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW) of new trailing edge coupons.
   This technical paper describes the repair process development and implementation of the different stages of the repair schemes and shows metallurgical and mechanical characteristics of the repaired regions of the component. As a result of successfully executing these special processes, although a heavy repair workscope was implemented; all the nozzles were successfully repaired without any scrap.

AB Cast NiCrAl alloys with additions of Y, La, Hf and Ti were evaluated at 1100 degrees C in wet (10 and 50% H2O) and dry air (0% H2O) in order to optimize such dopants for superalloy bond coatings. The results suggest that the typical Y addition in most coatings could be replaced by La. Also, scale adhesion in cyclic testing was improved with the co-addition of Hf with La or Y. Ti was added to investigate its incorporation in coatings on superalloys containing significant Ti additions. Particularly with co-doped alloys, the addition of Ti had little effect on scale adhesion but did reduce the depth of internal oxidation. Water vapor increased spallation, especially for the least adherent alloys, such as Y,Ti-doped NiCrAl. For the co-doped compositions with Hf, water vapor had a limited effect on scale adhesion and on the alumina growth rate in isothermal exposures. In addition to specimen mass change, the extent of internal oxidation and the depletion of beta phase in the substrate were evaluated. Analytical transmission electron microscopy showed that Y, La and Hf co-segregated to the alumina scale grain boundaries and formed dopant-rich oxide precipitates in the scale.

TI Solution heat-treatment of Nb-modified MAR-M247 superalloy
SO MATERIALS CHARACTERIZATION
AB MAR-M247 superalloy has excellent mechanical properties and good oxidation resistance at elevated temperatures. Niobium is an element known as gamma' phase hardener in nickel-based superalloys, besides promoting homogeneous distribution of MC carbides. This work is inserted in a project that aims to evaluate the total replacement of tantalum by niobium atoms in MAR-M247 superalloy (10.2 Co, 10.2 W, 8.5Cr, 5.6 Al, 1.6 Nb, 1.4 Hf, 1.1 Ti, 0.7 Mo, 0.15 C, 0.06 Zr, 0.015 13, Ni balance-wt.%). Based on microstructural characterizations (SEM and FEG-SEM, both with EDS) of the as-cast material and heat-treated materials as well as utilizing Thermocalc simulations and experiments of differential thermal analysis (DTA), heat-treatment at 1260 degrees C for 8 h was chosen as an ideal condition for the solution of Nb-modified MAR-M247 superalloy. The hardness of as-cast and ideally solution treated materials was 390 +/- 14 HV and 415 +/- 6 HV, respectively. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Development of wrought precipitation strengthened IN939 superalloy
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The potential of cast IN939 superalloy to be converted to wrought alloy has been explored in the present work. For this objective, bars of cast alloy were rolled under different conditions and then subjected to various heat treatment cycles. The results indicated that the yield strength, ultimate tensile strength and ductility of the wrought IN939 alloy are superior to the cast version. The stress rupture properties of wrought IN939 superalloy are better than those of the widely used superalloys, such as Nimonic 90 and Waspaloy, and approach the alloy Nimonic 105 properties. This is very notable because Nimonic 105 contains similar to 45 vol.-% gamma' that is much greater than the volume fraction of those strengthening precipitates in the alloy IN939 (similar to 35%). On the whole, the wrought form of this alloy has a high potential for manufacturing hot components to be used safely under aggressive turbine environment.

TI Creep mechanisms of a new Ni-Co-base disc superalloy at an intermediate
   temperature
SO JOURNAL OF MICROSCOPY
AB The microstructures of a new Ni-Co-base disc superalloy, TMW-4M3, before and after the creep test at 725 degrees C/630 MPa have been systematically investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The crept microstructures were marked as three different deformation stages (I, II and III) corresponding to the gradually increased strain. At stage I, stacking fault (SF) shearing was the main deformation mechanism. The SF was extrinsic and lay on {111} plane. However, deformation microtwinning became the dominant mode at stage II and III. The average spacing of deformation twins decreased from 109 +/- 15 nm at stage II to 76 +/- 12 nm at stage III, whereas the twin thickness did not change significantly. The influence of stacking fault energy (SFE) of ? matrix on the deformation mechanism is discussed. It is suggested that lower SFE in TMW-4M3 is partly responsible for the enhanced creep resistance.

TI Solidification and Segregation Behavior of Cast Ni-Base Superalloy IN792
SO RARE METAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING
AB The solidification process of cast Ni-base superalloy IN792 was comparatively investigated by differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) and isothermal solidification quenching (ISQ) experiment. The distribution characteristics of elements in solidified solid and residual liquid at different temperatures were also concerned. The isothermal solidification microstructure, the phase precipitation diagram, the solidification characteristic curve and the segregation behavior of elements at different temperatures in liquidus and solidus range were obtained. The results of ISQ indicate that the IN792 alloy possesses a liquidus temperature of 1328 degrees C. The onset of MC carbides and eutectic (gamma+gamma') formation take place at 1310 and 1225 degrees C, respectively. The secondary gamma' is precipitated at 1190 degrees C. The macro-solidus temperature determined by DSC was 1250 degrees C. The volume fraction of residual liquid at this temperature can reach about 5%. The end of the solidification happened at 1180 degrees C, designated as micro-solidus temperature. No liquid remained at this temperature. There is a 70 degrees C gap between macro and micro-solidus temperature. The hot tearing tends to occur in this temperature range. About 85 vol% solid phase was formed within a range of 30 degrees C below the liquidus temperature. In 1300 similar to 1270 degrees C range, the residual liquid in the interdendritic region changed from connected channels to the isolated micro-liquid pools, which is related to the formation of micro-porosity defect. The distribution coefficient of element W and Co are more than 1, indicating that they tend to distribute in solid phase in dendritic region, which are negative segregation elements. The distribution coefficients of element Zr, Mo, Ti, Ta and Cr are less than 1, indicating that they tend to distribute in liquid phase in interdendritic region, which are positive segregation elements. The element Al tends to distribute to liquid phase at the beginning of the solidification, and then be prone to concentrate in the solid phase in the dendritic region and transform to a negative segregation element followed by the solidification temperature decreased. The distribution coefficient of element Al and Ni increases but Mo and Cr decreases followed by the solidification temperature decreasing in 1325 similar to 1210 degrees C range. On the contrary, The distribution of element Al and Ni decreases but Mo and Cr increases followed by the solidification temperature decreasing in 1210 similar to 1180 degrees C range.

TI EFFECTS OF Re AND Ru ON MICROSTRUCTURE AND SEGREGATION OF Ni-BASED
   SINGLE-CRYSTAL SUPERALLOYS
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB The influence of Re and Ru on segregation and microstructure evolution during heat treatment has been investigated in four Ni-based single-crystal superalloys with varied contents of Re (3%-6%, mass fractions) and Ru (0% and 3%). The additions of Re and Ru lead to the more severe segregation of alloying elements in as-cast structures. However, the effects of Ru on as-cast segregation can be neglected after the stepwise solution heat treatments. The additions of Re and Ru lead to the lower gamma'-coarsening rate, more cuboidal gamma'-morphology and reduced gamma'-size. Electron microprobe analysis (EPMA) indicates that Al, Ta and Ni partition to the gamma'-precipitates, whereas Re and Cr strongly partition to the gamma-matrix. In comparison to Re and Cr, Ru and W show the less tendency to partition to the gamma-matrix. Additionally, Re increases the supersaturation of Re, Cr, Co and W in the gamma-matrix, whereas Ru only slightly suppresses the partition of these TCP-forming elements to the gamma-matrix.

The adsorption sites for O on the Ni3Al (0 0 1) surface are at the 2Ni-2Al fourfold hollow site, whereas O prefers to adsorb at the Ni-Al bridge site on (0 1 1) surface and 2Ni-Al threefold hollow site on (1 1 1) surface. It is found that O shows the strongest affinity for Al and the state of O is the most stabilized when O adsorbs on (0 0 1) surface, while the affinity of O for Al on (0 1 1) surface is weaker than (0 0 1) surface, and (1 1 1) surface is the weakest. The stronger O and Al affinity indicates more stable Al2O3 when oxidized. The experiment has shown that the oxidation resistance of single crystal superalloy in different orientations improves in the order of (1 11), (0 1 1), and (0 0 1) surface, suggesting that the oxidation in different crystallographic orientations may be related to the affinity of O for Al in the surface.

TI A new method to strengthen turbine disc superalloys at service
   temperatures
SO SCRIPTA MATERIALIA
AB TMW (R) superalloys have superior mechanical properties up to 725 degrees C. Numerous annealing twins are present because these alloys have relatively low stacking fault energies. Nanoscale deformation twins are the dominant mechanism during creep and tensile testing at 725 degrees C. In addition to traditional strengthening mechanisms enhanced by higher Ti addition, twinning structures enhanced by higher Co addition also play an important role in strengthening coarse-grained alloys at high temperatures. The effects of twin strengthening are discussed. (C) 2012 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI INFLUENCE OF SEGREGATION ON LIQUID DENSITY IN THE MUSHY ZONE OF DZ483
   Ni-BASED SUPERALLOY
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB Ni-based superalloys have been widely applied in advanced aeroengine as gas turbine blades and vanes. The freckles in superalloys formed during directional solidification have deleterious influence on the properties of the alloys. The generation of freckles is associated with the local liquid density gradient in the mushy zone, which is obviously influenced by microsegregation of alloy elements. However, the individual contributions of the various elements to the total density variation are still not well known. Therefore, the effect of microsegregation on the liquid density variation in DZ483 Ni-based superalloy was investigated by isothermal solidification together with liquid quench method. Solidification microstructures were observed by optical microscope and SEM, and the compositions of the solids and the residual liquid were determined by EDS. Based on the compositions of residual liquids; the densities of liquids at different temperatures were calculated. The results show that the onset solidification temperature of DZ483 alloy is a little bit below 1335 degrees C; and MC, which is enriched with Ta and Ti, formed at about 1325 degrees C. The segregation coefficients of different elements show that W and Co are negative segregation elements, Ta and Ti positive segregation elements, while Al and Cr show little segregation. The density of the residual liquid generally decreases as the decrease of temperature, with the exception that it increases somewhat from 1325 to 1315 degrees C. Calculation results show that temperature has insignificant influence on liquid density, and variation of density is mainly due to rnicrosegregation. Segregations of Mo and Ta lead to the increase of density, but segregations of Ti and W present opposite effect. Contribution of each element to the variation of the liquid density is analyzed. The sequence of contributions of alloy elements to the variation of total liquid density is Ti>Ta>W>Cr>Mo>Al>Co. The formation of MC consumes an abundant of Ti and Ta, resulting in the increase of liquid density from 1325 to 1315 degrees C.

TI Mechanical properties and fracture modes of an advanced Ni-Co-base disk
   superalloy at elevated temperatures
SO MATERIALS CHARACTERIZATION
AB The successful development of an advanced cast and wrought disk alloy, TMW-4M3, was initiated in the NEDO program supported by the Japanese government in cooperation with Mitsubishi Materials Corporation. This paper reports the mechanical properties and fracture modes of TMW-4M3 disk alloy, in order to support its high temperature uses and to understand prospective failure scenarios. The mechanical properties and fracture modes of tensile, creep, low cycle fatigue, and fatigue crack growth were evaluated up to 760 degrees C on specimens machined from the full-scale pancake-shaped disk. The excellent overall mechanical properties of TMW-4M3 alloy were demonstrated. Fracture modes were compared with different testing conditions and fractographic examinations indicated that the fracture modes shifted with changing test conditions. Surface crack initiation was the main failure mode at elevated temperatures. Crack propagation rate was accelerated above 650 degrees C due primarily to oxidation and degradation of mechanical strength. The results indicated that the TMW-4M3 alloy has at least 650 degrees C general capabilities and is promising for 700 degrees C or more applications. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Transient liquid phase bonding of FSX-414 superalloy at the standard
   heat treatment condition
SO MATERIALS CHARACTERIZATION
AB The as-cast samples of FSX-414 Co-based superalloy were heat treated at the standard solution and aging heat treatment cycles. Specimens for joining were cut from the as-cast ingot. Transient liquid phase (TLP) bonding was carried out at the standard solution cycle, using MBF-30 interlayer. Also, bonded specimens were homogenized at the standard aging condition.
   The microstructure of the as-cast, heat treated and TLP bonded specimens were studied. These studies showed that the non-uniform distributed carbides of the as-cast specimen were replaced by uniform ones during the heat treatment. Eutectic M23C6 carbides were observed in all specimens. Due to the complete isothermal solidification, no eutectic structure was observed in the bond region of bonded specimens. In the diffusion affected zone (DAZ) of these specimens, some intermetallics of the Co-B system were seen. Line scan EDS analysis across the bonding zone of the homogenized joint showed more uniform distribution of alloying elements in comparison with the unhomogenized joint.
   Hardness profiling across the bonding zone showed that isothermal solidification zone's (ISZ) hardness in the homogenized specimen is closer to the base metal (BM) hardness in comparison with the unhomogenized specimen. A hardness peak was observed in the DAZ region of the both homogenized and unhomogenized joints. Shear strength and shear fracture energy of the homogenized joint were about 93% and 82% those of the base metal, respectively. More fibrous zones and smaller dimples were observed at the homogenized joint's fracture surface, in comparison with the unhomogenized one. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The newly developed TMW (R) disk superalloy exhibits better overall mechanical properties in the intended service temperature region (650-750 degrees C) than the most advanced cast & wrought disk alloy U720Li. Clarification of the underlying mechanisms is beneficial for designing advanced superalloys. Among the TMW alloys, TMW-4M3 has the best tensile strength and creep resistance. In this study, tensile tests of U720Li and TMW-4M3 were conducted at temperatures ranging from 25 degrees C to 750 degrees C. The deformation microstructures have been investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Dislocation activity, involving anti-phase boundary (APB), was the dominant mechanism in U720Li up to 725 degrees C. However, the transition of deformation mechanisms from dislocation pairs cutting to stacking fault (SF) shearing and deformation twinning was observed in TMW-4M3. A concise model related to the increased surface energy is put forward to describe the competing mechanisms. It is found that APB energy, SF energy (SFE), and volume fraction of tertiary gamma' have important influence on the transition of deformation mechanisms. The controlling of deformation mechanism by alloy design is discussed.

AB The contributions of multiple strengthening factors to the 0.2% flow stress have been studied in a cast and wrought Ni-Co base disk superalloy with varying grain size, twin fraction and bimodal or trimodal gamma' size distributions. The alloy was heat-treated within the gamma' sub- and super-solvus temperature ranges between 1100 degrees C to 1180 degrees C, followed by two step aging heat-treatment. The contribution of each strengthening factor are analyzed by measuring its Vickers hardness at over a structural scale ranging from nano to micro levels and then by converting the hardness differences to the contribution to the 0.2% flow stress on the basis of the empirical relation: sigma(0.2)=2.46Hv. The results clearly show that the contribution of grain boundary strengthening decreased and reached zero with increasing solution temperature. The behavior followed Hall-Petch effect and Zener's pinning model, and strongly depended on the size and volume fraction of pinning primary gamma' that is un-dissolved during solution treatment. Meanwhile, the contributions of secondary and tertiary gamma' precipitation strengthening increased with increasing temperature. The behaviors also strongly depend on the volume fraction of the primary gamma' since the designed total volume fraction of gamma' of the alloy is approximately 0.5. As a result, the combinations of these strengthening factors lead to the maximum flow stress at solution temperature of 1135 degrees C. This would suggest that the primary gamma' plays an important role to optimize the microstructure combination through the solution heat-treatment.

TI DEVELOPMENT OF NI-BASED DS SUPERALLOY WITH EXCELLENT OXIDATION

AB In advanced industrial gas-turbine systems, there is a great demand for a new, excellent superalloy which can be used for large gas-turbine blades. Because it is very difficult to produce a large-scale Ni-based Single Crystal (SC) blade, we have developed new Directionally Solidified (DS) superalloys with an excellent combination of high-temperature creep strength, low-cycle-fatigue strength, good oxidation resistance, castability and hot-corrosion resistance. In this study, three kinds of Ni-based DS superalloys were designed with the aid of the d-electrons concept. The chemical compositions of these alloys were in the range of 1.4%Ti, 8.2%Cr, 11%Co, (0-1.0)%Ru, 3.6%Ta, 9.2%W, 1.0%Re, 5.2%Al, 1.40%Hf and balanced Ni in weight percent (wt%). Creep rupture tests, hot-corrosion burner-rig tests, low-cyclefatigue tests and oxidation tests were conducted with heat-treated DS specimens of these alloys. Two of the designed alloys showed the same level of creep rupture life as those of the 2nd generation DS superalloys currently in wide use. Oxidation tests at 1313K proved that the oxidation resistance of all the designed alloys was superior to that of all the reference alloys. The results of the hot-corrosion burner-rig tests showed that all the designed alloys had better corrosion resistance than the 2nd generation DS superalloys. As for Low-Cycle-Fatigue (LCF) strength, it was found that even 0.6%Ru addition greatly improved LCF strength, and the 0.6%Ru containing Alloy-B showed better LCF strength than any commercially used reference DS superalloys. A casting test was accomplished in a model bucket of a first stage blade of a 25MW-class gas turbine.
   Alloy-B is potentially a suitable alloy for making gas turbine blades with prolonged lifetimes and low maintenance costs in recent 1500 degrees C-class or even higher class gas turbines for power generation.

AB The low cycle fatigue behavior of a new cast and wrought Ni-Co-base superalloy TMW-4M3 was studied at 400, 650 and 725 degrees C under various strain ranges (0.79-1.22%). Detailed studies were performed on cyclic hardening/softening behavior, deformation substructure, fatigue life, as well as crack initiation and subsequent propagation. Continuous cyclic hardening until fracture was observed under various imposed strain ranges at 400 degrees C. Such hardening behavior was absent, whereas cyclic softening from the first cycle to failure at 650 and 725 degrees C was observed, except at 650 degrees C and low strain range (0.8%) where specimen exhibited relative stable stress response until failure initiation. Transmission electron microscopy analysis reveals that the cyclic hardening is due to the inhomogeneous dislocation activity and interactions of dislocations, and that cyclic softening is related to shearing of precipitates by stacking fault and coupled dislocation pairs combining with thermal activation process. Fatigue life decreased with increasing the test temperature or strain range. The relation between fatigue life and plastic strain followed the Coffin-Manson relation. Cracks often initiated on or near the surfaces of specimen during cycling, while subsurface carbide clusters initiation was also observed. Oxidation plays key role in accelerating crack propagation at 650 and 725 degrees C.

AB A new cast & wrought (C&W) superalloy, designated as TMW-4M3, has been developed on the basis of our innovative concept for applications of turbine disks and other components beyond 700 degrees C. TMW-4M3 contains 25 wt% Co and 6.2 wt% Ti, which are higher than that of commercial disk alloys. Full-scale pancakes with 400 mm in diameter and 50 mm in thickness were manufactured from TMW-4M3 alloy via a process route of triple-melting, billet making and disk forging. The investigations on the microstructure and the mechanical properties including tensile strength, creep resistance, fatigue strength and resistance to crack propagation of TMW-4M3 indicate that the alloy provides a 100MPa advantage in 0.2% yield strength at 750 degrees C and a 76 degrees C temperature advantage in 0.2%-strain creep performance loaded under 630MPa over Alloy 720Li (U720Li). The alloy maintains its gamma/gamma' two-phase structure exposed at 750 degrees C for up to 5000 hours. The increment of strength at high temperatures is attributed to the precipitation hardening caused by higher volume fraction of the secondary gamma' precipitates and twin boundary strengthening as a result of high density of annealing twins.

AB The surface cracks of 40Cr bars produced by Henan Jiyuan Iron & Steel (GROUP) CO., LTD are investigated by sampling, examining and analyzing, and the reason for surface cracking in the bar is also verified. The results indicate that the contents of silicate nonmetallic inclusion exceed the allowable levels. Combining with productive process, it can be concluded that the silicate nonmetallic inclusion, carbon segregation as well as high drawing speed at the process of continuous casting are the reason for the surface cracking of 40Cr bar. The emergence of surface cracks can be controlled effectively with series measures, such as improving the quality of molten steel smelting, strengthening the test of the top slag and reforming the corresponding equipments, and so on, then the percent defective of steel could be decreased from 0.68% to 0.35%.

TI Microstructure evolution in undercooled Co80Pd20 alloys
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB High undercooling has been achieved in Co80Pd20 melts by employing the method of molten glass denucleating combined with cyclic superheating, and the microstructure evolution with undercooling was systematically investigated. Within the achieved range of undercooling, 0-415 K, two kinds of grain refinements have been observed in the solidification microstructures. The three critical undercoolings are 72, 95, and 142 K, respectively. When undercooling is less than 72 K, the coarse dendritic morphology is formed, which is similar to the conventional as-cast microstructure. The first grain refinement occured in the range of undercooling, 72-95 K can be attributed to the breakup of dendrite-skeleton owing to remelting. When undercooling locates within 95-142 K, highly developed directional fine dendrite can be obtained because the severe solute trapping weakens the effect of solute diffusion during the dendrite growth. The second grain refinement occurred when undercooling exceeds the critical undercooling (a dagger T* = 142 K), the formation of fined equiaxed microstructure can be ascribed to the stress that originates from the extremely rapid solidification process, which resulted in the dendrite fragmentation finally.

TI Single-crystal solidification of new Co-Al-W-base alloys
SO INTERMETALLICS
AB Solidification processing of new high-temperature Co-Al-W-base single-crystals has been investigated. Single-crystal bars with compositions of Co-9.4Al-10.7W, Co-8.8Al-9.8W-2Ta and Co-7.8Al-7.8W -1.5Ta-4.5Cr (at%) were successfully grown with a conventional Bridgman process. Helical grain selectors resulted in [001] dendritic growth with primary dendrite arm spacings in the range of 278 -364 mu m. Segregation of constituent elements in the dendritic structure was very limited, compared to Ni-base single-crystals. Concentration profiles obtained by electron microprobe and analyzed via the Scheil equation indicate distribution coefficients for Co, Al, W and Cr that are close to 1. The distribution coefficient of Ta was approximately 0.6, indicating preferential segregation to the liquid during solidification. These observations collectively suggest that convective instabilities and freckle formation are unlikely to occur during solidification of single-crystals of this new class of high strength Co-Al-W-base alloys.

SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Co45Ni25Ga30 ferromagnetic shape memory alloys were treated by glass fluxing combined with superheating cycling. The effect of high undercooling on solidified microstructure and transformation temperatures was investigated. The martensite lath is obviously refined and a mass of sub-grains are produced with the increase of undercooling. Undercooling rapid solidification introduces a number of dislocations and large internal stress, which give rise to the production of sub-grains in recovery. During the following annealing process, these sub-grains can gradually recrystallize and grow up with an amount of gamma' phase precipitated. Meanwhile, transformation temperatures of undercooled alloys are greatly elevated compared with those of as cast, which results from the large internal stress, and gradually reduce with the heating time.

It is found that high N level would extend the solidification window during the solidification process, and then increase the quantity of the carbide eutectic phases and led to the distribution in the network form of the eutectics in the interdendritic regions. High nitrogen content (more than 40 ppm) can reduced the mechanical properties of the testing alloy. So, it is suggested that the nitrogen in the recycled Co-based superalloys should be controlled at a suitable level in order to avoid the degradation of their properties.

AB The as-cast FSX-414 Co-based superalloy samples were solution treated at 1150 degrees C for 4h and then aged at 980 degrees C for 4h. Specimens for joining were cut from the as-cast ingot and TLP bonding carried out at the same conditions as for the solution and solution+aging treatment, using MBF-30 interlayer.
   Microstructures were studied for as-cast, heat treated and TLP bonded specimens. These studies showed that the ununiform distributed carbides of MC type in the as-cast specimens replaced by M(23)C(6) type carbides with uniform distribution in the heat treated microstructure. Due to complete isothermal solidification, no eutectic structure in the bond region wasobserved, but some intermetallics in the diffusion affected zone (DAZ) were observed. Microhardness tests were used to compare the hardness of age hardened specimens with bonded specimens at the same heat treatment condition. Hardness profile also showed a peak in DAZ region in spite of complete isothermal solidification.

AB Superfine coatings have been attempted to prepare by Electro-spark deposition (ESD) on cast steel substrate. The microstructures and properties of the coating were investigated by X-ray diffractometer (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and microhardness tester. The results show that ultra-fine particles prevail in the coating. The primary phases of the coating contain Fe3W3C, Co3W3C, Si2W and W2C. Its average microhardness reaches 1511.75 HV. The results of abrasive test demonstrated that the coating had an excellent sliding wear resistance because the superfine particles distributed dispersedly in the coating increased the resistance to micro-cutting and plowing during the wear test, which effectively improves the surface performance of cast steel substrate.

Improvements in tensile properties were observed in the 2 h annealed specimen. Also, tempering of this specimen at different times shows that tensile properties and hardness increase and exceed those of the ASTM specification. However, elongation decreases during tempering.

   exposed nickel-base superalloy
SO PHASE TRANSITIONS
AB The effect of long-term thermal exposure and casting superheat on microstructure, topologically close-packed (TCP) phases, gamma' precipitation and mechanical properties of an experimental Ni-base superalloy were studied. The investigated alloys were produced by investment casting process under two levels of superheat. After solution heat treatment, at 1180 degrees C for 2 h followed by air cooling; the two alloys under investigation were isothermally exposed at 845 degrees C for 24, 200, 1000, and 1500 h. The long-term thermal exposure conditions have a significant impact on the precipitation and morphology of TCP and gamma' phases. The sigma phase precipitated as needle and platelet shapes, whereas the mu phase formed in plate and agglomerated shapes. The mu phase has high concentration of Cr, Mo, W, and Co, while the sigma phase has high percentages of Ni and Ti. The mu phase was precipitated after thermal exposure of 200 h in the case of high superheat specimen and after 1000 h in low superheat specimen. The eta phase found was also a thick plate-like shape in the microstructure of both alloys in the interdendritic zones. The optimum size and volume fraction of gamma' precipitates were obtained after being thermally exposed for 200 and 1000 h for high and low superheat alloys, respectively. Consequently, the highest hardness level was achieved at the optimum conditions of gamma' precipitates in high and low superheat alloys.

AB Both aviation and land based turbine components such as vanes/nozzles, combustion chambers, liners, and transition pieces often degrade and crack in service. Rather than replacing with new components, innovative repairs can help reduce overhaul and maintenance costs. These components are cast from either Co-based solid solution superalloys such as FSX-414, or Ni-based gamma prime precipitation strengthened superalloys such as IN738. The nominal compositions of FSX-414 and IN738 are Co-29.5Cr-10.5Ni-7W-2Fe (max)-0.25C-0.012B and Ni-0.001B-0.17C-8.5Co-16Cr-1.7Mo-3.4Al-2.6W-1.7Ta-2Nb-3.4Ti-0.1Zr, respectively. Diffusion brazing has been used for over 4 decades to repair cracks and degradation on these types of components. Typically, braze materials utilized for component repairs are Ni and Co-based braze fillers containing B and/or Si as melting point depressants. Especially when repairing wide cracks typically found on industrial gas turbine components, these melting point depressants can form brittle intermetallic boride and silicide phases that effect mechanical properties such as low cycle and thermal fatigue. The objective of this work is to investigate and evaluate the use of hypereutectic Ni-Cr-Hf and Ni-Cr-Zr braze filler metals, where the melting point depressant is no longer B, but Hf and/or Zr. Typically, with joint gaps or crack widths less than 0.15 mm, the braze filler metal alone can be utilized. For cracks greater than 0.15 mm, a superalloy powder is mixed with the braze filler metal to enable wide cracks to be successfully braze repaired. As a means of qualifying the diffusion braze repair, both metallurgical and mechanical property evaluations were carried out. The metallurgical evaluation consisted of optical and scanning electron microscopy, and microprobe analysis. The diffusion brazed area consisted of a fine-grained equiaxed structure, with carbide phases, gamma (gamma) dendrites, flower shaped/rosette gamma-gamma' (gamma-gamma prime) eutectic phases and Ni(7)Hf(2), Ni(5)HF, or Ni(5)Zr intermetallic phases dispersed both intergranularly and intragranularly. Hardness tests showed that the Ni-Hf and Ni-Zr intermetallic phase only has a hardness range of 250-400 Hv; whereas, the typical Cr-boride phases have hardness ranges from 800 Hv to 1000 Hv. Therefore, the hardness values of the Ni-Hf and Ni-Zr intermetallic phases are 2.5-3.2 times softer than the Cr-boride intermetallic phases. As a result, the low cycle fatigue (LCF) properties of the wide gap Ni-Cr-Hf and Ni-Cr-Zr brazed joints are superior to those of the Ni-Cr-B braze filler metals. The mechanical property evaluations were tensile tests at both room temperature and elevated temperature, stress rupture tests from 760 degrees C to 1093 degrees C and finally LCF, the latter being one of the most important and severe tests to conduct, since the cracks being repaired are thermal fatigue driven. At the optimum braze thermal cycle, the mechanical test results achieved were a minimum of 80% and sometimes equivalent to that of the base metals properties.

   CORROSION RESISTANCE
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB In order to meet the requirements of marine gas turbine blade materials, a, new-type directional solidification Ni-based superalloy named DZ68 was developed. The alloy composition was designed by low segregation technology. Its nominal chemical composition (mass fraction, %) is C 0.05, Cr 12.0, Mo 1.0, W 5.0, Co 8.5, Al 5.3, Ti 0.5, Ta 5.0, Re 2.0, B 0.01, and balance is Ni. The microstructures of as-east DZ68 alloy and after heat treatment states were analyzed by OM, SEM and XRD. The tensile, rupture and hot corrosion resistance properties of DZ68 alloy were compared with DZ125 and IN738 alloys. Results show that the microstructure of as-cast DZ68 alloy is composed of gamma, gamma', (gamma+gamma') eutectics, MC type carbides and a few borides. After heat treatment, the microstructure of DZ68 alloy is composed of gamma, gamma' and carbides. The carbides are mainly MC and M23C6. The tensile strength of DZ68 alloy decreases slightly with the increase of temperature, and reaches its minimum value at 700 degrees C. When the temperature is higher than 700 degrees C, the tensile strength increases so evidently that reaches its maximum at once at 760 degrees C, But when the temperature is higher than 760 degrees C its tensile strength decreases obviously. It is well recognized the relationship of the tensile strength of DZ68 alloy with temperature is abnormal, similar to that of its yield strength but opposite to that of its plasticity. The tensile and rupture properties of DZ68 alloy are nearly the same as those of DZ125 alloy and its hot corrosion resistance property is nearly the same as that of IN738 alloy under the same conditions.

SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB The melt superheating treatment during the directional solidification is carried out for DD3 Ni-based monocrystal superalloy. With the unchanged thermal gradient and withdrawn rate for different melt superheating temperatures, the influence of the melt characteristic on the microstructure and the mechanical property is studied. The results show that the dendrite and they gamma' precipitate are all obviously refined while the gamma' precipitate becomes more regular when the superheating temperature is increased from 1500 degrees C to 1640 degrees C and then to 1780 degrees C. The superheating treatment has no obvious influence on the dendrite segregation of Al, Cr and Co but can reduce the dendrite segregation degree of W, Mo and Ti. With the elevated superheating temperature, the gamma' rafts become more stable and the stress rupture property under 1040 degrees C/190 MPa is improved. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB The oxidation behavior of a cast polycrystalline Co-base superalloy was studied at temperatures from 900 to 1050 degrees C and analyzed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results indicate that a cast Co-base superalloy follows the subparabolic oxidation kinetics at 900 and 1000 degrees C, which are controlled by the growth of the inner Cr-rich layer, and that after oxidation at 1050 degrees C for 200 h, it almost exhibits the linear oxidation kinetics possible due to the volatility of Cr-rich oxide. A mixed scale forms on the alloy after prolonged oxidation. The oxide scale formed at 900 and 1000 degrees C is composed of an outer layer of spinel and an inner continuous Cr-rich layer and at 1050 degrees C is composed of a very discontinuous Cr-rich layer.

AB The fusion zone and heat affected zone (HAZ) microstructures of electron beam welded superalloy 718PLUS (TM) (718 Plus) that has been newly developed by ATI ALLVAC were examined. The microsegregation pattern during solidification of the fusion zone indicated that while Fe, Co, W, and Cr segregated to the core of the gamma dendrites, Nb, Ti, and Al were extensively rejected into the interdendritic liquid. Electron diffraction and X-ray microanalysis using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of the fusion zone showed that the major secondary phases that formed from the interdendritic liquid were gamma/MC type carbide eutectic and gamma/Laves eutectic constituents. HAZ microstructure showed partially melted zone immediately adjacent to the fusion zone and intergranular microfissuring associated with resolidified products which suggested that HAZ cracking in this alloy occurred by liquation cracking. Microstructural examination of the HAZ using analytical scanning electron microscope showed resolidified gamma/Laves eutectic on the cracked and backfilled grain boundaries. Fine resolidified MC type carbide particles were also observed in the HAZ. Causes of grain boundary liquation were identified and the solidification of intergranular liquid in the HAZ was discussed.

AB Both aviation and land based turbine components such as vanes/nozzles, combustion chambers, liners, and transition pieces often degrade and crack in service. Rather than replacing with new components, innovative repairs can help reduce overhaul and maintenance costs. These components are cast from either Co-based solid solution superalloys such as FSX-414, or Ni-based gamma prime precipitation strengthened superalloys such as IN738. The nominal compositions of FSX-414 and IN738 are Co-29.5Cr-10.5Ni-7W-2Fe [max]-0.25C-0.012B and Ni-0.001B -0.17C-8.5Co-16Cr-1.7Mo-3.4Al-2.6W-1.7Ta-2Nb-3.4Ti-0.1Zr, respectively.
   Diffusion brazing has been used for over four decades to repair cracks and degradation on these types of components. Typically, braze materials utilized for component repairs are Ni and Co-based braze fillers containing B and/or Si as melting point depressants. Especially when repairing wide cracks typically found on industrial gas turbine components, these melting point depressants can form brittle intermetallic boride and silicide phases that effect mechanical properties such as low cycle and thermal fatigue. The objective of this work is to investigate and evaluate the use of hyper-eutectic Ni-Cr-Hf and Ni-Cr-Zr braze filler metals, where the melting point depressant is no longer B, but Hf and/or Zr. Typically, With joint gaps or crack widths less than 0.15mm, the braze filler metal alone can be utilized. For cracks greater than 0.15mm, a superalloy powder is mixed with the braze filler metal to enable wide cracks to be successfully brazed repaired. As a means of qualifying the diffusion braze repair, both metallurgical and mechanical property evaluations were carried out. The metallurgical evaluation consisted of optical and scanning electron microscopy, and microprobe analysis. The diffusion brazed area consisted of a fine-grained equiaxed structure, with carbide phases, gamma [gamma] dendrites, flower shaped/rosette gamma-gamma' [gamma-gamma prime] eutectic phases and Ni(7)Hf(2), Ni(5)HF, or Ni(5)Zr intermetallic phases dispersed both intergranularly and intragranularly. Hardness tests showed that the Ni-Hf and Ni-Zr intermetallic phase only has a hardness range of 250Hv to 400Hv; whereas, the typical Cr-boride phases have hardness ranges from 800Hv to 1000Hv. Therefore the hardness values of the Ni-HF and Ni-Zr intermetallic phases are 2.5-3.2 times softer than the Cr-boride intermetallic phases. As a result the LCF properties of the wide gap Ni-Cr-Hf and Ni-Cr-Zr brazed joints are superior to those of the Ni-Cr-B braze filler metals. The mechanical property evaluations were tensile tests at both room temperature and elevated temperature, stress rupture tests from 760 degrees C-1093 degrees C and finally low cycle fatigue [LCF] tests, the latter being one of the most important and severe tests to conduct, since the cracks being repaired are thermal fatigue driven. At the optimum braze thermal cycle; the mechanical test results achieved were a minimum of 80% and sometimes equivalent to that of the base metals properties.

SO METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND
   MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Microstructural stability and microstructure-property relationship during long-term thermal exposure in K452 alloy (a new Ni-base cast superalloy with similar to 21 pct Cr, 11 pct Co, 3.5 pct W, 2.5 pct Al, 3.5 pct Ti, and others) are investigated. It is found that exposure temperature and time have significant effects on the microstructure and properties of the alloy. During exposure, the microstructure is degraded by gamma' coarsening, MC carbide (M mainly represents Ti. W, and Nb) degeneration, precipitation and evolution of grain interior (GI) M23C6 carbide, evolution of grain boundary (GB) microstructure, and precipitation of eta phase. Among them, the gamma' coarsening is the leading reason for the decrease of strength of the alloy. The GI M23C6 and the eta phase have negligible influence on the properties due to their relatively small populations. Blocky, closely spaced GB M23C6 particles engulfed in gamma' increase the stress-rupture life, whereas the formation of a continuous GB M23C6 chain has an opposite effect. A life peak occurs when the M23C6/gamma' structure at the GBs is in an optimal form. The degenerated MC is the preferred initiation site of microcracks. Its presence at the GBs promotes the onset of intergranular fracture; and leads to the decrease in mechanical properties.

TI Effect of heat treatment conditions on microstructures of new Ni-Co
   based superalloys for turbine disks
SO JOURNAL OF THE JAPAN INSTITUTE OF METALS
AB New Ni-Co based superalloys (TMW alloys) for gas turbine disks have been recently developed. These new alloys are designed to have higher temperature capability than that of U720Li disk alloy by 50 degrees C. The concept behind alloy design is to combine two kinds of gamma-gamma' structure alloys, U720Li (Ni-Ni3Al) and Co-Ti (CO-CO3Ti) alloys. In this article, we describe the effect of solution heat-treatment conditions on the microstructures of TMW disk alloys (TMW1, 2, 4, and 2 + 4Co), such as the grain size and volume fraction of the primary gamma' phases and the hardness. Microstructural observation results showed that the average grain size and volume fraction of the primary gamma' phases are strongly influenced by the solution temperatures. For each TMW alloy, we identified the relationship among the solution temperature, volume fraction of the primary gamma' phases, and grain size that is necessary to achieve optimum properties. Vickers hardness testing results showed that the addition of a Co-Ti alloy has a positive effect on alloy strengthening at room and elevated temperatures. These results can help determine the optimum heat-treatment condition.

SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB The results of investigations of boron and carbon segregations, boride and carbide phases forming in various elements of the structure of ingots of the Ni-base superalloy EP962 have been presented. The methods of light metallography (LM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray spectral microanalysis (XRSMA), high sensitive track autoradiography on boron via the nuclear reaction B-10(n, alpha)(7), Li and activation autoradiography on carbon via the reaction C-12(d, n)N-13 were used. Boron segregation and precipitation of boride phase in interdendritic regions and on the grain boundaries were established. Composition of boride phase was found to be (Ni0.32Cr0.22Nb0.14Mo0.11Co0.13W0.02Al0.02Ti0.01)B-0.67, which is of M3B2 type. Formation of the non-equilibrium gamma '-gamma eutectic in interdendritic regions causes microliquation of Cr, Nb, Mo, Co, W and B in the crown of gamma '-gamma eutectic that results in formation of boride particles in the crown of gamma '-gamma eutectic. Carbon was found mainly forming carbide particles in interdendritic regions. Composition of carbide particles was found by the XRSMA as (Nb0.6Ti0.22Ni0.10Cr0.02W0.01Hf0.01)C. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

TI Effect of Mo content on the microstructure and stress rupture of a Ni
   base single crystal superalloy
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB Ni base single crystal superalloys of three kinds of Mo content were prepared by screw selecting method. The microstructures and stress rupture properties of the superalloys with 2%, 3% and 4% Mo were compared. The results showed that as-cast structures of the three alloys were composed of gamma and gamma' phases. After heat treatment, mu phase obviously precipitated and grew in the alloys with 4% Mo, while only a few p phase in the alloys with 3% Mo, and in 2% Mo containing alloy no mu phase precipitated after heat exposure to 1100 degrees C /500 h. The mu phase was mainly composed of Mo, Re, W, Cr, Co, Nb etc., in which for the tendency of forming mu phase Mo is the strongest, Re, W, Cr are the second place and Co, Nb are the weakest. A lot of precipitation of rod-like mu phases damaged high temperature stress rupture properties of alloys. Due to a few mu phase no effect on the stress rupture property and the solid solution strengthening of Mo, the optimum Mo content should be 3% for the based alloy Ni-5Cr-10Co-4W-3Re-5.6Al-8Ta-1Ti-0.5Nb.

   from the melt
SO MATERIALS CHARACTERIZATION
AB In this study the composition of a Ni-Cr-Co based superalloy was modified with silicon additions in order to observe its effects on the microstructure. The evolution of the microstructure was investigated by electron microscopy of as-cast samples containing various amounts of Si ranging from 0.48 to 5.43 wt.%. The precipitated phases were identified through electron diffraction to be sigma (sigma), chi (chi), and M23C6. The sigma precipitates of blocky morphology appeared to enclose the precipitates of X phase. Lamellar regions consisting of sigma and M23C6 were observed to form along the boundaries between the sigma particles and the neighboring phases. These lamellar cells were observed to have grown into the intermetallic phases sigma and chi. A crystallographic relationship was also found to exist between the sigma and M23C6.

SO METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND
   MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB The fusion zone and heat-affected zone (HAZ) microstructures obtained during tungsten inert gas (TIG) welding of a commercial superalloy IN 738LC were examined. The microsegregation observed during solidification in the fusion zone indicated that while Co, Cr, and W segregated to the gamma dendrites, Nb, Ti, Ta, Mo, Al, and Zr were rejected into the interdendritic liquid. Electron diffraction and energy-dispersive X-ray microanalyses using a transmission electron microscope (TEM) of secondary phases, extracted from the fusion zone on carbon replicas, and of those in thin foils prepared from the fusion zone showed that the major secondary solidification constituents, formed from the interdendritic liquid, were cubic MC-type carbides and gamma-gamma' eutectic. The terminal solidification reaction product was found to consist of M3B2 and Ni7Zr2 formed in front of the interdendritic gamma-gamma' eutectic. Based on the knowledge of the Ni-Ti-C ternary system, a pseudoternary solidification diagram was adapted for IN 738 superalloy, which adequately explained the as-solidified microstructure. The HAZ microfissuring was observed in regions surrounding the fusion zone. Closer and careful microstructural examination by analytical scanning electron microscopy revealed formation of re-solidified constituents along the microfissured HAZ grain boundaries, which suggest that HAZ cracking in this alloy involves liquation cracking. Liquation of various phases present in preweld alloy as well as characteristics of the intergranular liquid film contributing to the alloy's low resistance to HAZ cracking were identified and are discussed.

   and its application to single-crystal superalloy castings
SO METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND
   MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Instrumental errors in microsegregation measurements in multicomponent alloys complicate the treatment of randomly sampled data. In this article, two new alloy-independent data treatment algorithms are presented that are capable of separating the effects of scatter in the data from the underlying segregation trends, assigning each measurement location a unique fraction solid. These new methods are physically reasonable and result in improved estimates of segregation parameters, particularly the solute partitioning at the dendrite tip. This is demonstrated by determining the microsegregation in four successive generations of single-crystal (SX) nickel-based superalloys. Artificial, noise-induced, tails commonly seen in the microsegregation profiles are also minimized. A methodology for evaluating sorting schemes is introduced that does not depend upon a priori knowledge of the partitioning direction. Comparison is made to both other sorting methods and CALPHAD predicted partition coefficients. Implications for alloy design are reported, illustrating the interaction between solute species such as Ru, Re, Co, and W.

AB The hot-section components in commercial aerogas turbines were typically made of nickel-based superalloys and were protected by coatings. Two kinds of diffusion aluminide coatings, including simple aluminide coating and NiCr-CrAl coating, were prepared on a nickel-based cast superalloy by LP-VCD and pack cementation techniques, respectively. The isothermal oxidation behavior of the cast alloy and the coatings at 1000 and 1100 degrees C and their hot corrosion behaviors in the presence of 75 wt.% Na2SO4+K2SO4 film at 900 degrees C were studied using TGA, scanning electron microscopy (SEM)/energy-dispersive spectrometry (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and electron probe microanalysis (EPMA), respectively. The results showed that NiCr-CrAl coating, not only held a very excellent oxidation resistance due to the alpha-Al2O3 formation on the coating surface during the isothermal process at 1000 and 1100 degrees C, but also possessed excellent hot corrosion resistance in sulphate melt. Internal oxidation and nitridation were found in the cast alloy during the oxidation process. Moreover, the cast alloy suffered from catastrophic hot corrosion, resulting in the serious internal oxidation and sulfidation. The oxidation resistance of the simple aluminide coating was superior to the cast alloy; the simple aluminide coating was damaged completely and lost its protective effect after the hot corrosion test. In addition, the mechanisms for oxidation and corrosion of the cast alloy and the coatings are discussed simultaneously. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Derived from Russian alloy CHS88U, six experimental Ni-base alloys named as A to F in the Ni-Cr-Co-W-Ti-AI-Hf system are designed, evaluated and processed. One of these alloys, F, shows excellent high temperature tensile strength and ductility with superior creep rupture properties. As predicted by using modeling tools such as PHACOM and NEW PHACOMP, there is hardly the tendency for formation of topologically close-packed phase (TCP) phase in alloy F. Furthermore, through microstructural observation, it is also found that no TCP phase is formed in alloy F after long-time exposure at high temperature. So alloy F has well balance of phase stability and mechanical properties in view of application for gas turbines. It is proved that d-electron approach can be applied for design and development of nickel-base superalloys for gas turbine application.

A temperature interval from the liquidus temperature to 800 K is covered, including solid state transformations. This paper discusses several results: fraction solid compared to results from Scheil and equilibrium calculations, microsegregation profiles for Al, Co, Cr, Re, Ta, Ti and W compared to experimental values, and the formation of finely dispersed gamma'-phase in the solid state. The relatively simple one-dimensional diffusion simulation is shown to be a valuable tool to investigate phase formation and microsegregation during solidification and cooling. In the case of CMSX-4 it represents a significant improvement over the commonly used Scheil calculations for the prediction of the fraction solid. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FATIGUE
AB Inclusions often play a dominant role in limiting fatigue life in both cast and wrought alloys under nominally elastic cyclic loading conditions. The hierarchical scales of fatigue crack formation and their correspondence to strain-life relations were considered for cast A356-T6 A1 in recent work by McDowell and co-workers using a microstructure-property framework that related cyclic plasticity near debonded silicon particle and large casting pores to formation and early growth of micro structurally and physically small fatigue cracks. In this paper, we turn our attention to the analogous role of carbides, oxides or other hard ceramic particles in fatigue crack formation in nickel-base superalloys. Cyclic plasticity of a directionally solidified (DS) nickel-base superalloy is evaluated in the [0 0 1] orientation. The effects of loading parameters (strain amplitude, R-ratio) and microstructural parameters (nonmetallic inclusion shape, spacing, etc.) on local cyclic plasticity at microstructure-scale notches are evaluated. The effect of neighboring grain orientation on intensification of plastic strain around inclusions is analyzed, and functions are determined for relating applied strain to cyclic plastic shear strain near the inclusion/matrix debond (micronotch) that contributes to LCF crack formation. Use of such a framework for predicting microstructure-dependence of fatigue crack initiation life and its variability are discussed, as are additional mechanisms of microfracture associated with cumulative plastic deformation.

AB Co-base superalloys have been applied in the stationary compoents of gas turbine owing to their excellent high temperaure properties. The stationary Co-base alloy components are generally manufactured by casting. Solidification behavior of the alloy is an important factor in the selection of casting parameters. In the present study, solidification microstructure and carbide formation behaviors were studied by directional solidification. Directional solidification experiments were carried out at the solidification rates of 0.5 similar to 150 mu m/s with the Co-base superalloy ECY768. Between the dendrites just below the final freezing temperature, MC carbide and M23C6 carbide were found. It was identified that the script or blocky carbides were Ta or W-rich MC carbide, and the lamellar carbides were Cr-rich M23C6 eutectic carbides. The solid/liquid interface morphology clearly showed that freezing of the Cr-rich eutectic carbide occurred just after the script type MC carbide.

CT International Symposium on Intermetallic and Advanced Materials
CY MAR 02-06, 2003
CL San Diego, CA
AB This paper investigates the role of varying refractory addition levels on the microsegregation behaviour of single crystal (SX) superalloys systems during solidification. Specifically, a series of six Ni-base alloy compositions are set in a controlled manner, such that the chemical effects of Re, W, and Ru can be independently assessed. Each experimental alloy is produced in the SX condition utilizing a modified Bridgman casting process, with subsequent compositional analysis of the solidification structures via standard electron microprobe analysis (EPMA) methods. Qualitative partitioning results indicate typical SX alloy segregation behavior with elements such as Cr, Co, Re, Mo, and W all segregating towards the dendrite core regions, while the gamma' forming elements of Al, Ti, and Ta show favorable partitioning to the interdendritic gamma-gamma' eutectic regions. Both Ni and Ru exhibit ideal segregation behaviour with no favorable partitioning to either phase. Quantitative EPMA results indicate that as the nominal Re level increases, the severity of microsegregation to the dendrite core regions rises dramatically for Mo, Cr, and Re. Remarkably, evidence is presented demonstrating the role that Ru plays in counteracting the microsegregation effects of both increased Re and higher overall total refractory levels.

AB The phases formed at the interface between an intermetallic (NiAl) and a nickel base superalloy joined by combustion synthesis were investigated, particularly the eutectic phases. Owing to their small size, the characterisation of these phases using a Castaing's electron microprobe encounters difficulties. The analysis volume size is generally too large to differentiate the phases from their surrounding matrix, even by using low accelerating voltage. Moreover, the eutectic phases contain boron, which is difficult to characterise by EPMA. Independently of the phases shape, the characterisation can be solved by viewing this complex system as a surrounding matrix and a multi layer system. The results of these simulations revealed the presence of two categories of borides: the eutectic boride MM'B-2(2) (M = Mo and M' = Co, Cr) and the solid solution boride [Cr1-x (Mo, W)(x)]B.

TI Formation of primary M6C carbide and its effect on cast die superalloys
   with high content of tungsten
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB Nickel based superalloys with high content of tungsten (W) have been applied to cast the large size die. Because the formation of large amount of primary M6C phase embrittles the die, it is necessary to explore the forming condition of primary M6C. The experiments prove that the alloys containing carbon content higher than 0.15% (mass fraction) tend to precipitate primary M6C carbide and 10% Co can restrict the formation of M6C effectively. The primary M6C forms at 1375 V. The cooling rate between the solid and liquid temperature range can influence the precipitation of this phase sensitively. Rapid cooling retard the formation of M6C obviously. The section size effect of the formation of M6C exists in castings. For a heavy section possessing dendrite spacing higher than 150 mum, it is very easy to form M6C with a millimeter magnitude, which damages the high temperature strength of alloys. To prevent the precipitation of M6C in large size section die, the composition of alloy is recommended to maintain at the level of 0.04%-0.07% C and 10%-15% Co.

TI Comparison of thermal expansion and oxidation behavior of various
   high-temperature coating materials and superalloys
SO MATERIALS AT HIGH TEMPERATURES
AB The thermal expansion mismatch between a metallic substrate and its external oxide scale generates a strain on cooling that is a primary cause of spallation of protective oxide scales. This study compares thermal expansion behavior and cyclic oxidation performance of the two major composition classes of high-temperature commercial coatings for protection of single-crystal superalloys. The thermal expansion of cast MCrAlY (M = Ni and/or Co) alloys and cast aluminides (NiAl, (Ni,Pt)Al and Ni(3)Al) was measured at temperatures up to 1300degreesC and compared to that of a single-crystal Ni-base superalloy. The tendency for scale spallation from each alloy was evaluated by cyclic oxidation testing at 1150degreesC. The coefficients of thermal expansion for the aluminides were lower than those of the MCrAlY-based alloys at all temperatures and scale adherence to the Hf-doped aluminides was generally superior. Scale adherence to the various compositions of MCrAlY-type alloys did not directly correlate to their thermal expansion behavior or substrate strength. For both types of materials, the presence of a reactive element (Y,Hf, etc.) had no detectable effect on thermal expansion but a major effect on scale adherence. There was no obvious influence of At content on the thermal expansion of beta phase Ni-Al compositions. The addition of Pt resulted in a lower average thermal expansion for hyperstoichiometric (Ni,Pt)AI at temperatures above 930degreesC, but this effect was not observed in hypostoichiometric (Ni,Pt)AI.

TI Solidification behavior of a cast nickel-base superalloy
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB The solidification behavior and as-cast microstructure feature of a cast nickel-base superalloy M963 have been investigated by SEM (EDXS) and DTA. The results show that the solidification sequence of M963 superalloy is as follows: L-->L+gamma --> L+(gamma'+MC)+ gamma --> (gamma+gamma') + (gamma+MC)gamma --> (gamma + gamma') + (gamma + MC)+gamma + gamma'. The as-cast microstructure is dendritic and consists of gamma solid solution matrix, gamma' precipitate, the script-like MC carbide and (gamma + gamma') eutectic in the interdendritic region. Carbon causes a decrease in liquidus and (gamma + gamma') eutectic temperature, and an increase in MC carbide formation temperature, thus decreases the volume fraction of (gamma + gamma') eutectic and increases the volume fraction of MC carbide. The refractory element W and Co are rich in dendrite arm but Al, Ti, Nb, Cr and Mo rich in interdendritic region.

AB Modelling and simulation of macrosegregation has experienced explosive growth since the pioneering studies of Flemings and co-workers in the mid-1960s. This paper presents a review of recent macrosegregation models, with particular emphasis on their application to selected industrially relevant casting processes. The successes and shortfalls of the models in predicting measured macrosegregation patterns are noted. Although it is still early in their development, advanced macrosegregation models that include a detailed consideration of the solidification microstructure are also reviewed. Recent studies involving direct numerical simulation of macrosegregation related phenomena on a microscopic scale are highlighted. Important issues deserving future research attention are identified.

TI Effect of high-temperature protective coatings on fatigue lives of
   nickel-based superalloys
SO FATIGUE & FRACTURE OF ENGINEERING MATERIALS & STRUCTURES
AB This study concerns MCrAlY coatings (M is Ni, Co or both) sprayed by a vacuum plasma spraying process for protection against high-temperature corrosion and oxidation of gas turbine components, such as turbine blades and duct segments. The effect of high-temperature protective coatings on fatigue lives of nickel-based superalloys were investigated at high temperature under push-pull loading and rotary bending and then compared with uncoated superalloys, such as equiaxed IN738LC, unidirectional solidified CM247LC and single-crystal CMSX-2. The high-cycle fatigue lives of MCrAlY-coated superalloys at high temperature under push-pull loading showed an inferior performance when compared with the uncoated superalloys. This was because the crack initiation site was different. The high-cycle fatigue cracks of nickel-based superalloys initiated at casting cavities which were exposed on the specimen surface, whereas the high-cycle fatigue cracks of MCrAlY-coated specimens initiated at interface defects, such as small pores and grid residue, between the MCrAlY coating and the substrate and grew into the MCrAlY coating, and then into the substrate. Similarly, the rotary bending fatigue properties of MCrAlY-coated superalloys at high temperature showed an inferior performance when compared with the uncoated superalloys. This is because of a high stress due to the higher Young's modulus of the MCrAlY coating (in comparison with the substrate) being induced at the MCrAlY coating surface. The crack initiation site was on the specimen surface in both cases of the nickel-based superalloys and the MCrAlY-coated superalloys, respectively. As a result, it was considered that, for rotary bending tests, the fatigue life reduction was due to the high stress that originated from the difference of elastic constants between the MCrAlY coating and the superalloy. Consequently, in fatigue life design it is necessary to take account of the stress levels in a coating layer.

SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Dendritic segregation in conventionally cast, commercially heat treated and exposed MarM002 turbine blades has been investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). During casting Cr, Co and W segregate to the dendrites and Hf, Ti and Ta segregate to the eutectics. As a result of the dissolution of gamma' precipitates in the dendrites and coarsening of gamma' precipitates in the eutectics this segregation aggravates during exposure at 1000 degreesC. At this high exposure temperature homogenisation of dendritic segregation does not occur because it involves long diffusion distances and a low driving force compared with dissolution and coarsening of gamma' precipitates.

TI Sulfidation behavior of Inconel 738 superalloy at 500-900 degrees C
SO OXIDATION OF METALS
AB The high-temperature sulfidation behavior of the cast nickel-base superalloy Inconel 738 (IN-738) was studied over the temperature range 500-900 degreesC in pure sulfur vapor over the range 10(2)-10(4) Pa. The sulfidation kinetics followed the parabolic rate law in all cases. The sulfidation rates increased with increasing temperature and sulfur pressure. The scales formed were bilayered and temperature-dependent. At T less than or equal to 700 degreesC, the outer scale consisted of mostly NiS (with dissolved Co) and minor (CoS2 and NiCo2S4, while the inner layer was a heterophasic mixture of NiS, NiCo2S4, and minor amounts of Al2S3 and chromium sulfide (Cr2S3/Cr3S4) At T greater than or equal to 750 degreesC, the outer scale consisted of mostly Ni3S2 (With dissolved Ca) and minor amounts of Co3S4 and Cr2S3/ Cr3S4, while the inner layer was a complex, heterophasic mixture of Ni3S2, Cr2S3/Cr3S4, CoCr2S4, and minor Al2S3. Platinum markers were found to be located at the interface between the inner and outer scales, suggesting that the outer scale grew by the outward transport of cations and the inner scale grew by the inward transport of sulfur. The formation of Al2S3 and Cr2S3/Cr3S4 partly blocked the transport of cations through the inner scale and consequently reduced the sulfidation rates as compared to pure nickel.

AB Surface crack of components of the cast nickel-base superalloy was repaired with twin laser beams under proper technological conditions. One laser beam was used to melt the substrate material of crack, and the other to fill in powder material to the crack region. The experimental results show that the surface crack with the width of 0.1 similar to0.3 mm. could be repaired under the laser power of 3 kW and the scanning speed of 6 similar to8 mm/s. The repaired deepness of crack region is below 6.5 mm. The microstructure of repaired region is the cellular crystal, columnar crystal dendrite crystal from the transition region to the top filled layer. The phases in repaired region mainly consisted of supersaturated a-Co with plenty of Ni, some Cr and Al, Cr23C6, Co2B, Co-Ni-Mo, M4B3, TiSi and VSi. The hardness of filled layer in repaired region ranged from HV(0.2)450 to HV(0.2)500, and the hardness decreases gradually from the filled layer to joined zone.

TI Influence of crystallographic orientation and stress waveforms on
   fatigue strength of single crystals of a Ni-base superalloy
SO JOURNAL OF THE JAPAN INSTITUTE OF METALS
AB The stress-controlled fatigue tests were performed at 700 degrees C. In this study, two kinds of fatigue testing procedures were adopted. One is the tension-compression triangle-waveform test (R = -1). The other is the tensile or compressive stress hold testing procedures. Cracks initiated at casting pores under tensile stress conditions. Only in compressive stress hold test, crack was initiated by stage I cracking (crystallographic cracking on the {111} slip plane). In [011] and [(1) over bar 11], the transition from mode I cracking (perpendicular to the principal stress axis) to mode II-type crystallographic cracking on the {111} slip plane was occurred easily because there were not enough non-co-planar slip systems in order to relax: the stress concentration near the crack-tip.
   The [001] crystals showed stable mode I crack growth because the stress concentration at crack-tip was relaxed by homogeneous multiple slip. The creep-fatigue damage mechanisms were found to be divided into two groups. In the case of the [001]-compressive and [011]-tensile stress hold waveforms, deformation occurred by mechanical-twin shear through gamma and gamma'. On the other hand, in the case of the [001]-tensile and [011]-compressive stress hold waveforms, each gamma' particle was sheared by superlattice partial with the fault bounded Shockley partial because the direction of shear stress on the (111) plane was opposite to that of microtwin formation. Fatigue lifetimes were decreased by the formation of deformation twinning.

The cast K38G alloy formed Cr2O3 and TiO2 scales, and a zone of internal Al2O3 precipitation. Weight-gain kinetics followed the parabolic rate law under all conditions investigated. The sputtered K38G nanocrystalline coating, however, formed a single-phase Al2O3 scale and no internal-oxidation zone. The parabolic rate constants for nanocrystalline coating oxidation were about one order of magnitude smaller than those of the cast alloy. The changes in reaction morphology and rate are attributed to the more vapid grain-boundary diffusion of aluminum in the nanocrystalline material.

(wt.%) was prepared by the investment casting process. The alloy was solution annealed at 1553K for 2h and then air cooled, followed by a two-step aging treatment for 5h at 1293K and then air cooled, followed by 1143K and air cooled to room temperature. The microstructural characteristics were evaluated through optical and electron microscopic observations. Electro probe microanalysis and energy-dispersive analysis of X-rays were conducted to study the (W, Mo)-rich phase precipitated in the new alloy. The results showed that the alloy is coarse grained (similar to 5mm) with serrated grain boundaries and a relatively homogeneous composition. This alloy contains uniform gamma-gamma' microstructure and a fine, discrete W-Mo-containing phase together with discrete carbides M6C and M23C6, which coexist at grain boundaries. All of these microstructural features are thought to be beneficial to the superior creep rupture life of the newly developed nickel-base superalloy. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1997.

SO OXIDATION OF METALS
AB A novel, low-expansion experimental Ni-Cr-Al-Ti-Si bond-coating alloy was investigated in the as-cast state concerning its phase stability, oxidation resistance in ail, and interdiffusion with single-crystal IN-100 at 900, 1000, and 1100 degrees C. Isothermal oxidative thermogravimetry was employed up to 500 hr. Interdiffusion was compared to a commercial Ni-Co-Cr-Al-Y alloy on IN-100. Oxidized Ni-Cl-Al-Ti-Si specimens and diffusion couples were characterized by metallography, SEM, EDX, XRD, and XRF. The Ni-Cr-Al-Ti-Si alloy provides good oxidation resistance in aii at least up to 1000 degrees C. The alloy is an alumina former. Due to its coarse microstructure, other oxides (e.g., rutile) may form and considerably nominate the oxidation behavior. The kinetics of oxidation were correlated with temperature, formation of phases, and morphology of oxides. Interdiffusion fluxes between Ni-Cr-Al-Ti-Si and IN-100 were mainly directed to the superalloy. They were faster than in Ni-Co-Cr-Al-Y/IN-100 diffusion couples.

   FABRICATED BY RHEOCASTING
SO MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS JIM
AB An investigation was made on the effect of rotational stirring on the microstructures, distribution of solute elements, carbide formation, phosphorus segregation, and distribution coefficients between solid and liquid phases in the Ni-base superalloy TMP-3 (Ni-11.15%Cr-6.74%Co-3.12%Mo-3.98%Al-2.74%Ti-3.93%Nb-3.25%W) by rheocasting with the rotation of a stirrer in the range of 20 to 70 rev / s. The main results obtained are summarized as follows: (1)  When the TMP-3 superalloy was sufficiently agitated at 70 s-1 from the start of solidification, the dendrite structure was broken up and an equiaxed grain structure with the average primary solid particle size of 65 +/- 15 mum was formed. (2) The distributions of Ni,Cr,Co,Al,Ti,Mo,Nb,W,P and C in the super alloy TMP-3 ingots rheocast at 70 s-1 and stationary cast were measured by using a computer-aided microanalyzer (CMA). The concentrations of main eight metallic elements in the center of equiaxed grains in the rheocast alloy were almost equal to those in the center of dendrites in the stationary cast alloy. (3) It was observed from the measurement on the distribution of Ti and Al that the size of gamma' phases in the rheocast alloy tend to decrease as compared with that in the stationary cast one. (4) It was observed that granular MC carbides containing mainly Nb, Ti and Mo precipitate uniformly along the grain boundary in the rheocast alloy, although the plate-like MC carbides precipitate in the grain boundary of the stationary cast alloy. (5) The distribution of P measured by CMA showed that P segregates considerably in the grain boundary, but the degree of phosphorous segregation in the rheocast alloy tend to decrease as compared with that in the stationary cast one. (6) The solid-liquid distribution coefficients estimated from the concentration of main eight elements in the center of primary crystals were almost consistent with the equilibrium distribution coefficients obtained by thermodynamic calculation including an additional consideration on solute interactions.

AB Specimens of investment-cast Mar-M247 superalloy were vacuum-plasma sprayed with Co-29Cr-6Al-1Y bond coat, and part of the specimens were further pre-aluminized at 980-degrees-C for 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 hours. All the specimens were then deposited with ZrO2-8 wt.% Y2O3 thermal-barrier coatings (TBCs) and thermally cycled at 1050-degrees-C to evaluate the effect of time of the prealuminizing treatment on the performance and failure mechanism of the modified system. Results showed that TBC specimens with pre-aluminized bond coatings exhibited lower oxidation rates and significantly higher cyclic life when compared with unaluminized specimens. The failure of bond-coat pre-aluminized TBC specimens was observed to propagate mainly along the lamellar splats of the top coat, whereas the failure of conventional TBC specimens occurred mainly along the top-coat/spinel oxides interface.

TI SOLUTE ELEMENT DISTRIBUTION AND CARBIDE FORMATION IN NI-BASE SUPERALLOYS
   FABRICATED BY RHEOCASTING
SO JOURNAL OF THE JAPAN INSTITUTE OF METALS
AB An investigation was made on the effct of stirring on the microstructures, distribution of solute elements, carbide formation, phosphorus segregation and distribution coefficients between solid and liquid phases in the the Ni-base Superalloy TMP-3 (Ni-11.15%Cr-6.74%Co-3.12%Mo-3.98%Al-2.74%Ti-3.93%Nb-3.25%W) by rheocasting with the rotation of a stirrer at a speed in the range of 20 to 70 rev/s. The main results obtained are summarized as follows:
   (1) When the TMP-3 superalloy was sufficiently agitated at 70 s-1 from the start of solidification, the dendrite structure was broken up and equiaxed grain structure with the average primary solid particle size of 65 +/- 15-mu-m was formed.
   (2) The distributions of Ni, Cr, Co, Al, Ti, Mo, Nb, W, P and C in the superalloy TMP-3 ingots rheocast at 70 s-1 and stationarily cast were measured by using a computer-aided microanalyzer (CMA). The concentrations of main eight metallic elements in the center of equiaxed grains in the rheocast alloy were almost equal to those in the center of dendrites in the stationary cast alloy.
   (3) It was observed from the measurement of the distribution of Ti and Al that the size of gamma' phases in the rheocast alloy tend to decrease as compared with that in the stationarily cast one.
   (4) It was observed that granular MC carbides containing mainly Nb, Ti and Mo precipitate uniformly along the grain boundary in the rheocast alloy, although the plate-like MC carbides precipitate in the grain boundary of the stationary cast alloy.
   (5) The distribution of P measured by CMA showed that P segregates considerably in the grain boundary, but the degree of phosphorous segregation in the rheocast alloy tend to decrease as compared with that in the stationary cast one.
   (6) The solid-liquid distribution coefficients estimated from the concentration of main eight elements in the center of primaly crystals were almost consistent with the equilibrium distribution coefficients obtained by thermodynamic calculation including an additional consideration on solute interactions.
