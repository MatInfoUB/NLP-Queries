AB Mechanical properties of Ni-Cr-Fe-based Alloy 718 depend very much on
   the grain size, as well as the presence of strengthening phases, gamma'
   and gamma". The grain size of superalloy parts can be controlled by the
   thermo-mechanical processes, including heating, forging and cooling
   sequences. In order to predict the evolution of grain size in Alloy 718
   blade forging, a series of constitutive equations for dynamic
   recrystallization, meta-dynamic recrystallization and grain growth were
   developed and implemented into a 3D FE simulator. The evolution of grain
   structure in the process of two-step blade forging of Alloy 718 was
   simulated using the 3D FE simulator combined with a microstructure
   module. The microstructure prediction tool was validated by comparing
   the simulated grain structure with that of the experimental blade-type
   forging. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This work is concerned with NiCrAlY and NiCoCrAlY coatings deposited on
   the superalloy IC-6 (Ni(3)Al-base superalloy) by arc ion plating (AIP).
   The results indicated that the presence of Al and Mo in alloy IC-6
   impeded Cr atoms moving from coatings to substrates during the
   deposition process. As a consequence, the distribution of Cr is well
   proportioned in both NiCrAlY and NiCoCrAlY coatings. Vacuum heat
   treatment drastically increased diffusivities and the coating became
   more uniform. The interdiffusion also led to the phase transformation in
   the coatings. Although gamma'-Ni3Al and gamma-Ni were still the major
   phases in the coating, their lattice constant a(0) decreased. The
   results of isothermal oxidation showed that the oxidation behavior of
   coatings obeyed the parabolic rate law. The oxidation resistance was not
   influenced very much by the presence of Co in the NiCrAlY coating at 900
   degreesC static atmosphere. NiCoCrAlY coating had poorer oxidation
   resistance than NiCrAlY coating when they were exposed at 1000 degreesC.

AB Over the past several years, advances in the design and fabrication of
   planar solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) have led to a steady reduction in
   the temperatures necessary for their operation. Consequently, it appears
   more realistic now to use low cost heat-resistant alloys for
   interconnect components in the SOFC stack. However, no specific criteria
   or inclusive study are available as a reference to help select and
   evaluate suitable candidates from the hundreds of available
   heat-resistant alloy compositions, which overall demonstrate oxidation
   resistance at high temperatures. In this work, composition criteria have
   been proposed for the preselection of heat-resistant compositions, such
   as Ni-, Fe-, and Co-based superalloys, Cr-based alloys, and stainless
   steels. The proposed criteria have been employed to establish a database
   of heat-resistant alloys at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, where
   a systematic approach has been initiated to evaluate and modify and/or
   develop alloys for SOFC interconnect applications. The preselected
   compositions are further evaluated by referring in-house studies and
   reference to published data. It appears that it would be difficult for
   traditional alloys to fully satisfy the materials requirements for
   long-term operation at temperatures higher than 700degreesC. However,
   the applicability can be improved via surface/bulk modification and by
   the implementation of novel stack designs. (C) 2003 The Electrochemical

AB Ni-Fe base superalloy, Inconel 718, was processed through powder
   metallurgy (P/M) hot isostatic pressing (HIP) route. In order to balance
   the strength and ductility, the HIPed material was given the standard
   heat treatment, viz. solution treatment at 980 degreesC for 1 h/water
   quenched (WQ) to room temperature and a two-step ageing treatment
   consisting of 720 degreesC for 8 h/furnace cooling (FC) at 55 degreesC
   h(-1) to 620 degreesC and holding at 620 degreesC for 8 h before air
   cooling (AC) to room temperature. Optical microscopy and scanning
   electron microscopy (SEM) studies on the heat treated alloy have shown a
   homogeneous microstructure with fine grain size (25 mum) along with the
   presence of prior particle boundary (PPB) networks. Transmission
   electron microscopy (TEM) on the heat treated material has revealed the
   presence of oxides, MC carbides and delta-precipitates at the grain
   boundaries and a uniform precipitation of fine gamma" and gamma'
   strengthening phases in the matrix. Tensile and stress rupture tests
   were performed on the heat treated material. While the yield strength
   (YS) and ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of the HIPed and heat treated
   alloy at room temperature and 650 degreesC were comparable to those of
   conventionally processed wrought IN 718, its ductility was lower. The
   stress rupture life of the HIPed alloy improved marginally due to heat
   treatment and met the minimum specification requirement of life hours
   but the rupture ductility was found to be inferior to that of the
   wrought material. The fractography of the failed samples has revealed
   the transgranular ductile mode of fracture in the as-solution treated
   alloy, while intergranular mode of failure with the decohesion of PPBs
   occurred more predominantly in the aged condition. This change of
   fracture mode with ageing treatment shows the ductility dependence on
   the relative strength of the matrix and PPBs. The TEM studies on the
   deformed alloy have revealed that the brittle oxides and carbides at the
   prior particle boundaries coupled with the fine gamma" and
   gamma'-precipitates in the matrix are responsible for low ductility at
   650 degreesC. The investigations of the present study have led to better
   understanding of the structure-property relationships in HIP+heat
   treated alloy 718 and suggest that the standard heat treatment
   recommended for wrought IN 718 is not suitable for HIPed alloy and has
   to be modified to realise optimum properties. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science

AB Laser surface annealing (LSA) treatments were conducted to decrease the
   hydrogen embrittlement (HE) sensitivity of Inconel 718. Hydrogen was
   charged into the alloy by a cathodic-charging process. The LSA treatment
   significantly reduced the strength loss of the hydrogen-precharged
   notched specimen. Tensile tests and elasto-plastic simulations were
   performed to study how LSA affects the HE sensitivity of the as-aged
   Inconel 718. Various heat treatments were applied to the notched tensile
   specimens to obtain different precipitation states of gamma". All
   tensile tests were conducted in air at room temperature under identical
   conditions. One specimen of each kind was free of hydrogen; another was
   charged with hydrogen prior to the tensile test. A correlation between
   the HE sensitivity and the precipitation state of the alloy was
   confirmed by assessing the loss in the notch tensile strength due to
   hydrogen pre-charging. The gamma" particles, especially those in the
   surface layers, were proved to have deleterious effects on the HE
   sensitivity of Inconel 718. Fractures originated from the surface
   vicinity in the as-aged specimen when there was precharged hydrogen.
   However, hydrogen-induced fractures in the LSA-treated specimen
   originated in the deep region of the laser-annealed surface layer.
   Stress concentration conditions at the notch roots were studied via
   elasto-plastic finite element method simulations. The area of most
   highly concentrated stress of the LSA-treated specimen was in deep layer
   of the laser-annealed notch region where the material was partly
   annealed. The formation of the annealed surface layer that has better HE
   resistance than the as-aged alloy, and the migration of the fracture
   origin to deeper layers were considered to be the mechanism for
   decreasing the HE sensitivity by the LSA. Further, the partly annealed
   raw alloys with strength comparable to the LSA-treated specimens were
   found to have much higher HE sensitivities than the corresponding
   LSA-treated specimens. Both the experimental results and the simulation
   results suggested that the LSA caused the fracture origins to migrate
   from surface to deep layers. It is possible to reduce the HE sensitivity
   of Inconel 718 without sacrificing its strength by applying LSA to
   produce locally annealed surface zones. (C) 2003 Laser Institute of

AB Effects of the hot-isostatic pressing (HIP) process on microstructures
   and mechanical properties of Ni-base single crystal superalloy CMSX-4
   were investigated. In the overall heat treatment process, the HIP
   treatment remarkably induced the healing behavior of micropores and
   decreased the pore size and porosity of superalloy CMSX-4 compared with
   normally treated specimens. The microstructure of gamma' phase after the
   HIP process showed rather a coarsening tendency and could be developed
   by the partially solution and aging treatment. Consequently, the
   elimination of cast micropores using the HIP step resulted in the
   inhibition of crack initiation in microstructure and improved the
   stress-rupture lives of Ni-base single crystal superalloy by 185%.

AB Both in phase and out of phase thermomechanical fatigue (TMF) tests were
   conducted using a computer controlled, servohydraulic uniaxial fatigue
   system. The TMF behaviour of nickel based superalloy K417 was
   investigated. The experimental results show that, in comparison with
   isothermal low cycle fatigue, both in phase and out of phase TMF lead to
   much reduced fatigue lives, although there is a difference between the
   in phase and out of phase cases. Creep and oxidation are the main
   concerns in the lower fatigue life of in phase TMF. The cyclic hardening
   at initial cycles results from the obstacle of gamma' precipitates to
   the slipping dislocations and the increase in dislocation density owing
   to deformation. Shearing of gamma' precipitates and loss of coherency of
   gamma' precipitates with the matrix at high temperatures are the reasons
   for cyclic softening at later stages of fatigue life.

AB The low-cycle fatigue and fatigue-crack-growth behavior of the HAYNES
   HR-120 alloy was investigated over the temperature range of 24 degreesC
   to 980 degreesC in laboratory air. The result showed that increasing the
   temperature usually led to a substantial decrease in the low-cycle
   fatigue life. The reduction of fatigue life could be attributed to
   oxidation and dynamic strain-aging (DSA) processes. The strain vs
   fatigue-life data obtained at different temperatures were analyzed. It
   was also found that the fatigue-crack-growth rate per cycle generally
   increased with increasing temperature and R ratio (R =
   sigma(min)/sigma(max), where sigma(min) and sigma(max) are the applied
   minimum and maximum stresses, respectively). The relationship between
   the stress-intensity-factor range and fatigue-crack-growth rate was
   determined. Scanning-electron-microscopy (SEM) examinations of the
   fracture surfaces revealed that the fatigue cracks initiated and
   propagated predominantly in a transgranular mode.

AB Gas turbine blades are often covered with protective coatings to
   withstand the high thermal and corrosive loads during operation. One of
   the most effective coating systems used consists of a MCrAlY bond coat
   and a YSZ thermal barrier coating. At high operating temperatures, a
   depletion of aluminum in the bond coat occurs not only due to the
   formation of thermally grown oxide (TGO), but also due to interdiffusion
   between bond coat and substrate. Other elements, e.g. Ti, may diffuse
   outwards and lead to spallation of TGO. Exclusion of these
   interdiffusion effects could prevent premature coating failure.
   a-alumina was deposited as a diffusion barrier by CVD on a nickel-based
   superalloy (CMSX-4) and then coated with NiCoCrAlY and ZrO(2). The
   thickness of the coatings was 3, 20 and 500 gm, respectively. The
   samples were annealed at 1373 K for 100 h in argon atmosphere. All
   samples were analyzed by XRD, SEM and WDX to investigate the efficiency
   of the diffusion barrier. No delamination or cracks were observed except
   vertical segmentation cracks in the TBC. The diffusion barrier remained
   intact suppressing any noticeable interdiffusion, while the adhesion
   still needs to be improved. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

AB An in situ study of the kinetics of nucleation and growth of the gamma'
   phase in the single crystal Ni base superalloy SC16 was carried out by
   means of neutron diffraction. The investigation was aimed at a better
   understanding of the fundamental kinetic phenomena, in view of the
   optimisation of the heat treatments applied prior to the industrial use
   of the alloy. On heating above the solvus point (1525 K) the gamma'
   phase decomposes, and when cooling down back towards lower temperatures,
   it reappears. Measuring superlattice reflections allows the different
   stages of decomposition, nucleation, growth and concurrent coarsening to
   be followed. Results show that at temperatures T less than or equal to
   1490 K an increasing volume fraction of gamma' can be found with
   decreasing temperature, until saturation occurs at around 1100 K.
   Following classical kinetic theory, an Avrami like growth (time) law was
   used at each aging temperature and the isothermal reaction rates
   calculated. They show a maximum at around 1300 K, where the competing
   nucleation and growth processes find equilibrium. Nucleation and growth
   can be described with a modified Arrhenius law, analogous to that used
   for eutectoid reactions. The reaction rate first increases with the
   undercooling and then decreases. This implies a change in the character
   of the reaction, which was found to be initially surface and then bulk
   driven.

AB Thermodynamic equilibrium and Gulliver-Scheil as well as diffusion
   calculations using the DICTRA program have been made to simulate
   solidification and heat treatment of the nickel-base superalloy SC16.
   These simulations were validated by comparing them with own and
   literature experiments concerning directional solidification, heat
   treatment and differential thermal analysis (DTA) cycles. Equilibrium
   calculations predicted very well the element distribution in homogenized
   samples. Gulliver-Scheil based on the CALPHAD method and modified to
   serve multi-component systems proved to deliver sufficiently correct
   data for the directional solidification of SC16. The element
   distribution obtained after cooling below the solvus temperature and by
   DTA heating and cooling cycles was, however, only described with
   acceptable precision by applying the diffusion model. All these models
   require a sound multicomponent thermodynamic data set. Since DICTRA
   needs much more computing time than the other models it should only be
   applied wherever its higher precision is actually asked for.

AB The evolution of residual stress in the thermally grown oxide (TGO),
   formed on bond coats (BC) produced by diffusion of Pt into a Ni-based
   superalloy, has been studied as a function of thermal cycling using
   photo-luminescence piezo-spectroscopy through the yttria-stabilised
   zirconia (YSZ) thermal barrier coating. The luminescence spectra were
   analysed in terms of a high stress and a low stress contribution to the
   residual stress sampled at a single analysis point (approx. 20 mum in
   size); the low stress contribution being caused by either local TGO
   fractures or interfacial delamination The mean compressive residual
   stress increases during the first two thirds of the lifetime due to
   gradual stiffening of the non-planar TGO as it thickens and becomes more
   resistant to bending. In the last third of life the mean stress tends to
   decrease due to relaxation by increasingly numerous local damage events.
   This is more pronounced as a dramatic increase in the parameters that
   quantify the extent of the low stress contributions. Spatial mapping of
   the low stress contributions shows that they are isolated at first, but
   become more numerous towards the end of life and coalesce into larger
   regions of damage a few hundred mum in size. Eventual spallation is by
   unstable delamination at the BC/TGO interface and the stored elastic
   energy released is between 40 and 80 J m(-2). The lifetime is governed
   by the growth of the local damage regions until one (probably near an
   edge) reaches a critical size above which it propagates in a highly
   unstable way over most of the interface. (C) 2002 Acta Materialia Inc.

AB The effect of hold-time on fatigue crack growth behaviors of WASPALOY
   alloy was investigated. It was found that the role of hold-time depends
   on the competition between the harmful environmental effect and the
   beneficial effect of creep. If temperature is not higher than 705
   degreesC, fatigue crack growth rate of WASPALOY alloy increases with
   hold-time. On the contrary, hold-time plays a beneficial role on steady
   state fatigue crack growth of WASPALOY alloy at 760 degreesC and lower
   stress intensity factor. The beneficial effect of hold-time was
   attributed to the creep caused stress relaxation during the hold-time.
   However, accumulated creep damages cause to cavity nucleation and growth
   at the grain boundaries, and then accelerate fatigue crack growth.
   Hold-time plays a harmful role during the final stage of fatigue crack
   growth. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

AB The nickel-base alloy Inconel 718 exhibits a strength-differential, that
   is, a different plastic flow behavior in uniaxial tension and uniaxial
   compression. A phenomenological viscoplastic model founded on
   thermodynamics has been extended for material behavior that deviates
   from classical metal plasticity by including all three stress invariants
   in the threshold function. The model can predict plastic flow in
   isotropic materials with or without a flow stress asymmetry as well as
   with or without pressure dependence. Viscoplastic material parameters
   have been fit to pure shear, uniaxial tension, and uniaxial compression
   experimental results at 650degreesdegreesC. Threshold function material
   parameters have been fit to the strength-differential. Four classes of
   threshold functions have been considered and nonproportional loading of
   hollow tubes, such as shear strain followed by axial strain, has been
   used to select the most applicable class of threshold function for the
   multiaxial model as applied to Inconel 718 at 650 degreesC. These
   nonproportional load paths containing corners provide a rigorous test of
   a plasticity model, whether it is time-dependent or not. A J(2)J(3)
   class model, where J(2) and J(3) are the second and third effective
   deviatoric stress invariants, was found to agree the best with the
   experimental results. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB An in situ study of the kinetics of the nucleation and growth of the
   gamma' phase in the single-crystal Ni-base superalloy SC16 was carried
   out by means of neutron diffraction. This alloy has industrial
   applications (turbine blades for power generation) and is of scientific
   interest because of its modelling properties (small number of
   components). Upon cooling after solutionising the gamma' phase at T(s) =
   1250 degreesC (the solvus temperature), the gamma' precipitates
   reappear. The different stages of the nucleation and growth of gamma',
   as well as the successive (concurrent) coarsening, could be followed
   using a superstructure reflection. Results show that at T less than or
   equal to 1200 degreesC an increasing volume fraction of gamma' can be
   found with decreasing temperature, saturation occurring around 800
   degreesC. Holding the alloy at a constant temperature, an Avrami-like
   growth law is applicable; the isothermal reaction rates have a maximum
   around 1050degreesC, where the competing processes are in equilibrium.
   This explains the pseudo-Arrhenius behaviour, which does not agree with
   an Ostwald ripening (i.e. with a pure Lifschitz-Slyozov-Wagner
   size-distribution law).

   superalloy In-738LC have been investigated using SEM, TEM, EDS and XRD.
   The corrosion performance of the coatings has been also investigated by
   hot corrosion and cyclic oxidation tests. In order to evaluate the hot
   corrosion performance, the anodic polarization curves were measured in
   Na4SO4-25 mol%NaVO3-5 mol%NaCl at 1053 K. The cyclic oxidation test was
   carried out by exposure to alternate conditions of air atmosphere at
   1373 K and room temperature. The analyses of SEM, EDS and XRD were also
   used to characterize attack morphologies of the coatings exposed to the
   test conditions. The results showed that the heat-treated slurry
   Si-modified aluminide coating was composed of beta-NiAl phase including
   fine precipitates, which were found to be complex silicides. The results
   of hot corrosion tests indicated that at least 10-13 mass%Si in the
   coating layer is needed to improve the corrosion resistance of the
   aluminide coating. The coatings that met this criterion also showed a
   good cyclic oxidation resistance.

AB The next generation of Ni-based alloys for aeroengines are richer in
   gamma' than existing alloys and are more difficult to weld by
   conventional means. Inertia welding is Currently being developed as a
   joining technique for these alloys. Steep microstructural gradients have
   been observed in nickel-based superalloy RR1000 tube structures welded
   by inertia friction welding, ([1]) and in this article, the concomitant
   residual stresses are mapped at depth using neutron diffraction. One
   tube in the as-welded and two in the postweld heat-treated (PWHT)
   condition have been investigated. In the case of the as-welded specimen,
   it was necessary to establish the variation of the stress-free lattice
   parameter, a(0), across the weld line to infer elastic strain from
   lattice spacing changes. A biaxial sin(2) psi measurement on thin slices
   was used to determine an as a function of the axial position from the
   weld line. This was in excellent agreement With the variation inferred
   by imposing a stress balance on the axial measurements. The change of
   a(0) across the weld line can be rationalized in terms of the observed
   variation in the element partitioning effect between the matrix (gamma)
   and the precipitates (gamma'). It was found that the residual stresses
   in the weld and heat-affected zone generated by the welding process are
   large, especially close to the inner diameter of the welded ring. The
   experimental results have shown that, in order to relax the residual
   stresses sufficiently, the heat-treatment temperature must be increased
   by 50 degreesC over the conventional heat-treatment temperature. This is
   due to the high gamma' content of RR1000.

   investigated by means of torsion testing in extended ranges of strain
   rate (0.01-1 s(-1)) and temperature (1140-1180 degreesC). The flow
   curves have shown, in general, an increase in equivalent stress up to a
   peak value followed by a softening until rupture. At 1140 degreesC, for
   strain rates varying between 0.01 and 1 s(-1), the peak in flow stress
   is followed by a marked softening up to a steady state condition which
   can be attributed to the occurrence of dynamic recrystallisation. The
   hot ductility vs. true temperature, occurring during torsion tests, has
   been analysed. Flow behaviour of NIMONIC 115 alloy vs. process
   parameters has been modelled by means of an equation relating the
   hyperbolic sine of flow stress to the temperature-modified strain rate.

AB Ni-base directionally solidified (DS) superalloys have the advantage of
   production costs over the single crystal (SC) superalloys because of
   better yield rate of casting and a simpler heat treatment compared with
   SC superalloys. In our previous work, we developed a third generation DS
   superalloy TMD-103 which exhibits good creep strength, equivalent with
   second generation SC superalloys. In this study, we attempt to develop a
   fourth generation DS superalloy that have better creep strength than
   TMD-103. To strengthen the grain boundaries of the new DS alloys, C and
   B were added to the fourth generation SC superalloy, TMS-138, that has
   good phase stability and a long creep life by Ru and Mo addition. Creep
   behavior of the as-cast and heat-treated new DS alloy is investigated.
   As a result of creep tests at 1100 degrees centigrade under a load of
   137 MPa, the creep time at 1% strain in the heat-treated alloy is twice
   as long as that of TMD-103.

   higher than in UNS N07001, the higher Al content alloys did not exhibit

   boundaries when it was solution-treated below 1,313 K (1,040degreesC

AB The relationship of heat treat quench process, microstructure, and
   mechanical property in powder metallurgy superalloy Rene88DT had been
   experimentally studied to initiate the numerical simulation of gamma'
   precipitation and mechanical properties. Two novel cooling schemes were
   applied to study the cooling gamma' precipitation behavior. One was
   continuous cooling test carried out by linearly controlling cooling rate
   during quenching, which was to study the effect of cooling rate on the
   cooling gamma' precipitation and tensile strength. Another was
   interrupted cooling, which is performed by interrupting a continuous
   cooling test at the different intermediate temperatures. Interrupted
   cooling test is aimed at studying the development of gamma' precipitates
   during a quenching process, Strength response to the interrupt
   temperature was also investigated. Cooling gamma' precipitates are
   defined as those gamma' precipitates formed during the quenching after
   supersolvus solution. It was found that the size of the gamma' cooling
   precipitates increases with the decrease of cooling rate, which follows
   a power law with an exponential being about 0.47. The as-quenched
   strength increases with the increase of cooling rate. For a fixed
   cooling rate. the sizes of cooling gamma' precipitate increases as a
   linear function of interrupt temperature. However, a non-monotonic
   decrease in strength was observed as the interrupt temperature
   decreases. Aging treatment contributes to the final strength, with an
   increase of about 10%. which is believed to be related to the continuous
   growth of tiny gamma' during aging. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier

AB Precision cast high-temperature components often contain specific
   imperfections like micropores or microcavities. The influence of the
   position, size and distribution of such micro cavities as well as of the
   parameters of the thermo-mechanical fatigue loading on the lifetime
   behaviour of the superalloy MAR-M247LC was investigated using two
   specimen series, containing a high and a low amount of microcavities and
   a state from which any microcavity was removed by hot isostatic
   pressing. Thermo-mechanical fatigue (TMF) tests with zero ("in phase")
   and -135degrees phase shift between temperature and mechanical strain
   were performed. The different damage behaviour at in-phase and
   -135degrees TMF requires different methods of the assessment of
   microcavities. For the in-phase loading, they are regarded as cracks and
   their effect on the local strain distribution is determined by the crack
   opening displacement. This leads to very good results for both specimen
   states investigated. For the -135degrees cycle, it is taken into account
   that the microcavities in the core of the specimens increase the loading
   in the microcavity-free shell of the specimen. This method corresponds
   closely to the effective damage mechanism and yields good results for
   both microcavity contents investigated.

   Besides the primary residual stress effect, the thermoelectric method is
   also sensitive to the secondary "material" effects of shot peening
   (local texture, increased dislocation density, hardening), but it is
   entirely insensitive to its "geometrical" by-product, i.e., the rough
   surface topography. Our experimental results in copper indicate that the
   developed method is more sensitive to residual stress effects than to
   the secondary material effects, but unequivocal separation of residual
   stress relaxation from the parallel decay of secondary cold-work effects
   is generally not feasible. However, since the ratio of residual stress
   to cold work is primarily determined by the material and the specific
   surface treatment used, the thermoelectric method still offers the
   unique capability of nondestructively monitoring thermomechanical
   relaxation below the treated surface. Preliminary results on IN100
   nickel-base superalloy are also presented to demonstrate that the
   proposed method might be applicable to a wide range of alloys including
   high-strength, high-temperature engine materials.

   improve the proportion of equiaxed grains at cross-section. While adding
   mixed refiners, at a conventional pouring temperature of 1400 C. the
   average size of equiaxed grains (r) could be refined to the order of
   ASTM 1.7, the proportion of equiaxed grains at traverse cross-section
   (p) could be improved from 56%, to 96% with the melt superheating
   treatment. Furthermore, r could be refined to 0.1158 mm, i.e. to ASTM
   3.2, and p has been increased to 99% without the melt superheating
   treatment. When the pouring temperature is 1420 degreesC, r has been
   refined to the order of ASTM M10.5, and p could be increased to 90% by
   the addition of mixed refiners and the melt superheating treatment.
   Additionally, the mechanisms of grain refinement were proposed and the

AB With good corrosion resistance, reasonable room-temperature ductility,
   and excellent strength up to temperatures of 700 degreesC, Ni(3)Si-based
   alloys show considerable potential for structural applications. The
   Ni-Si alloys used for acid-corrosion resistance suffer from a dynamic
   environmental embrittlement when tested at intermediate temperatures
   around 600 degreesC. To assess these Ni-Si alloys for
   elevated-temperature structural application, the mechanical properties
   of these alloys strengthened by Ni(3)Si precipitates were systematically
   evaluated at different temperatures in various test environments. Oxygen
   was identified as the embrittling species responsible for the low
   ductility and premature fracture of the Ni-Si alloys. A strong
   dependence of elongation and fracture mode on strain rate was observed.
   Based on the understanding of the embrittlement mechanism, some unique
   approaches for improving the intermediate-temperature ductility,
   strength and fabricability of Ni-Ni(3)Si alloys were identified:
   reactive element doping (such as Zr and Y) to change the grain boundary
   chemistry; preoxidation to form adherent oxide layers; and
   thermomechanical processing to tailor the grain structure/shape. Some
   other properties such as creep resistance and weldability of these
   alloys were also briefly evaluated and are discussed in this paper. (C)

AB Influences of induction heating on the age-hardening process of a
   Nickel-base cast superalloy, IN738LC, was investigated. In this study
   cast specimens were undergone a solution treatment process in an argon
   atmosphere controlled furnace at 1125degreesC for 2 hours. Then, they
   were quenched in oil to room temperature to obtain supersaturated solid
   solution. These samples then subjected to two types of aging with equal
   heating rate, 30degreesC/Sec. One was induction aging and the other salt
   bath aging. Effects of these types of aging on the structure were
   analyzed and compared with normal aging having an average heating rate
   of 400degreesC/hr. The age-hardening behavior and microstructural
   characteristics were studied by hardness testing, scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM), electron image analyzing, X-ray diffractometery (XRD)
   and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with replica method.
   According to the results obtained by these experiments, although the
   rate of heating of the specimens in induction and salt bath aging were
   equal, the diffusion-control process of nucleation and growth of gamma'
   precipitates in induction aging were considerably accelerated.
   Furthermore, desirable characteristics of gamma' precipitates were
   achieved in induction aging at lower time and temperature in comparison
   with times and temperatures of other types of aging. Improvement of
   microstructural characterization obtained in induction aging was related
   to the existence of an external electromagnetic force produced by
   induction heating. This electromagnetic force raised the effective
   driving force necessary for age-hardening process and intensified the
   nucleation and growth of gamma' precipitates remarkably. (C) 2002 Kluwer

AB A new method, superplastic forming (SPF) has been proposed for the
   production of complex-shaped INCONEL(R) alloy 718 components. For SPF, a
   microstructure with fine grain is one of the necessary factors. In this
   paper, one fine-grained pretreatment process to obtain a microstructure
   with fine grain (ASTM 11-12) for common INCONEL alloy 718 plate is
   reported, and this processing route includes a solution treatment at
   1050 degreesC for 0.5 h with successive water quenching, hot-rolling
   (about 60%), cold-rolling (about 40%) and annealing treatment at 950
   degreesC for 0.5 h. For the fine-grained INCONEL alloy 718, superplastic
   properties such as strain rate sensitivity and total uniform elongation
   are presented and discussed. The microstructural features such as grain
   size stability and cavitations following superplastic deforming are also
   presented. It is shown that the elongation to failure of the
   fine-grained INCONEL alloy 718 varied from 180 to 368.2% when the alloy
   was deformed at temperatures between 920 and 960 degreesC with initial
   strain rates ranging from 6.1 x 10(-4) to 1.2 x 10(-2) s(-1), and the
   elongation to failure increases with decreasing strain rate. The strain
   rate sensitivity m of the alloy is always higher than 0.3. Dynamic grain
   growth was present during superplastic deforming for the alloy, and
   after superplastic deforming, cavities were found. (C) 2002 Elsevier

   scanning electron microscopy; transmission electron microscopy; energy

   inward grown coating (high activity), while MDC150L is produced by
   outward growth (low activity). Samples were oxidised in still laboratory
   air at 1050 degreesC for various times up to 2000 h. It was found that
   the outward grown coating produced a slower growing oxide that was more
   spallation resistant. Several possible reasons for this were identified
   including: coating purity; coating surface topography; and ductile to
   brittle transition temperature. The microstructural differences between
   the two coatings in the as-coated condition were investigated and the
   development of their microstructure during heat treatment was described.
   A model for coating growth during heat treatment was proposed. (C) 2002

   strongly increases the critical resolved shear stress of [001] oriented

   motion, Hydrogenated samples exhibit a different behavior depending on
   the presence of gamma' microprecipitates: internal hydrogen increases
   the critical resolved shear stress of fully gimel specimens whereas the

AB A series of deformation experiments was conducted on nickel-base
   polycrystalline superalloy IN738LC at 850 degreesC. The material showed
   distinct rate/time-dependent deformation, while cyclic hardening or
   cyclic softening behavior was relatively small in general. In the case
   of cyclic deformation with tensile or compressive strain holding time,
   anomalous inelastic behavior was observed; a stress-strain hysteresis
   loop continued to shift toward the opposite direction of the strain hold
   with the increase in the number of cycles. Consequently, the mean stress
   continued to increase significantly with cycles. Using conventional
   kinematic hardening rules, the expression capability under the strain
   hold waveform conditions was discussed through numerical calculations.
   It seemed that adequate description of the evolutionary behavior of the
   mean stress was difficult to achieve using the conventional hardening
   rules because of the characteristics of the dynamic recovery term of
   back stress. A kinematic hardening rule was proposed within a
   viscoplasticity framework in order to describe the growth behavior of
   the mean stress under the strain hold waveform conditions precisely. A
   new internal variable that had influence on the dynamic recovery
   property of the back stress was incorporated into the evolutionary
   equation of the back stress. An evolutionary law of the proposed
   internal variable was assumed to be a function of the static recovery
   property of the back stress. Numerical simulations were conducted using
   the proposed viscoplastic constitutive equations for various inelastic
   behaviors of the IN738LC at 850 degreesC, such as monotonic tension,
   stress relaxation, creep and cyclic deformation with/without the strain
   holding period. It was demonstrated that the present viscoplastic
   constitutive model can describe the inelastic behavior of the material
   with sound accuracy, including the anomalous behavior observed under the
   cyclic deformation with the strain holding period, i.e. the evolutionary
   behavior of the mean stress with the increase of cycles. (C) 2002

   advanced nickel base superalloys for turbine disc applications. The role
   of creep, fatigue and oxidation in crack growth has been investigated at
   650 degreesC under typical loading waveforms at selected loading
   frequencies. Load-line deflections were monitored in selected tests
   under static and long dwell loading conditions. Scanning electron
   microscopy was adopted to identify the fracture mode and to facilitate
   the evaluation of oxidation.
   The results show that mixed time and cycle dependent crack growth seems
   to be the predominant crack growth mode in the two PM nickel alloys
   studied. Whilst limited creep may be present at the crack tip,
   particularly under static and long dwell loading conditions, oxidation
   appears to be the predominant mechanism for crack growth under the test
   conditions examined. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All roghts reserved.

   by means of constant extension rate tensile (CERT) tests performed at 5
   x 10(-7) s(-1), in air and under secondary vacuum, in the temperature
   range 400-600 degreesC. Below 470 degreesC, the Portevin-Le Chatelier
   (PLC) effect occurs and leads to shear fracture. Above 500 degreesC, the
   PLC effect disappears and oxidation-induced intergranular cracking takes
   place. The transition from serrated flow to continuous plastic flow
   occurs abruptly in a narrow temperature domain (470-500 degreesC) and
   coincides with a transition from ductile to intergranular cracking.
   Thus, the interactions between oxidation and plasticity at the crack tip
   were investigated by means of a specific CERT test conducted at 500
   degreesC up to 4% plastic strain and at 470 degreesC up to fracture in
   air. Results show that the local plastic strain rate may control the

AB A two-layer plasma sprayed thermal barrier coating on Ni base superalloy
   substrate was characterized. The coating was comprised of an inner layer
   of MCrAlY bond coating and an outer layer of 8 wt% yttria stabilized
   zirconia (YSZ) thermal barrier coating (TBC). After aging, the thermally
   grown oxide (TGO) layer at interface between YSZ and MCrAlY was
   observed. The TGO layer had two different contrast layers in the SEM
   images. The black one was closer to MCrAlY and the gray one was closer
   to YSZ. The thickness of both layers increased with aging. Countless
   porosities at the gray layer and microcrack at YSZ were also observed.
   Most of the macrocrack grew through the porosities. From this point of
   view one may say that the mechanism of macrocrack formation is a
   deterioration of adhesion accompanied by an increase of number of the
   porosities or the microcrack.

AB A mathematical model of the influence of rapid induction heating on the
   nucleation and growth of secondary phases in diffusion controlled
   processes has been developed. The total stress produced by the
   electromagnetic field and acting on the volume V of a specimen was
   derived and added to other external stresses applied to the system.
   Then, the total effective stress was introduced into mathematical
   equations of diffusion controlled nucleation and growth processes. In
   addition, the effect of rapid induction heating on the age hardening
   treatment of a selected cast nickel base superalloy, IN738LC, was
   investigated experimentally. For this purpose, two types of rapid aging
   with equal heating rates were applied: one treatment was induction aging
   and the other was salt bath aging. Microstructural characteristics of
   gamma' precipitates and hardening behaviour were studied by means of
   scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electron image analysis,
   transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and hardness testing. According
   to the results obtained, although the rates of heating in induction and
   salt bath aging were equal, the rates of nucleation and growth of gamma'
   precipitates in induction aging were much faster than those obtained in
   salt bath aging, especially in the first minutes of the aging process.
   Furthermore, the characteristics of gamma' precipitates with induction
   aging were more favorable than those with salt bath and normal aging. It
   was observed that the growth rate of gamma' in induction aging deviated
   considerably from the t(1/3) growth law of the standard modified
   Lifshitz, Slyozov, and Wagner (MLSW) theory. The remarkable improvement
   of microstructural characteristics obtained with induction aging can be
   attributed to the existence of the external electromagnetic force
   produced by rapid induction heating. (C) 2001 IoM Communications Ltd.

AB An experimental programme was carried out to study the thermomechanical
   fatigue life of the nickel base superalloy IN738LC used in gas turbines.
   First, out of phase and in phase thermomechanical fatigue experiments
   were performed on uncoated and air plasma spray coated materials. In the
   temperature range investigated, it was observed that deposition of a
   NiCrAlY coating did not affect the thermomechanical fatigue resistance.
   A physically based life prediction model that takes into account the
   contribution of different damage mechanisms was then applied. This model
   successfully reflected the temperature and strain rate dependences of
   isothermal cycling fatigue lifetimes, and the strain-temperature history
   effect on thermomechanical fatigue lifetimes.

AB Ni-Cr-Al-P coatings were deposited on the Ni3Al-base superalloys IC-6
   and K17 by are-ion plating. The results indicated that a small amount of
   substrate atoms, such as Co, Ti, Mo, etc., existed in the Ni-Cr-Al-Y
   coatings near the substrates, probably due to "sputter" and
   "antisputter." For the alloy K17, the impeding effect of Al was not
   obvious, because the temperatures of the substrate and the coating were
   high (420-480 degreesC) during the deposition process and interdiffusion
   was accelerated. However, for alloy IC-6 which contains Al, as well as a
   high concentration of Mo, the diffusion of Cr was impeded. Vacuum heat
   treatment at 1050 degreesC drastically increased diffusivities and the
   presence of Al and Mo was not enough to prevent some Cr diffusion. Thus,
   the coating became mor e uniform and close to the desired composition.

AB The effect of undercooling on grain structure is investigated in pure
   nickel, Ni(75)Cu(25), and DD3 single-crystal superalloy by employing the
   method of molten salt denucleating combined with thermal cycling.
   Meanwhile, a comparison of factors that may be related to structure
   formation is performed and the difference in the refined structure
   between Ni75Cu25 alloy and DD3 single-crystal superalloy is explained.
   Only one grain refinement occurs at the critical undercooling in pure
   nickel, whereas two take place at both low and high undercoolings in
   Ni(75)Cu(25) and DD3 single-crystal superalloy melts. The first grain
   refinement at low undercoolings mainly originates from dendrite
   remelting driven by the chemical superheating produced in recalescence,
   and the second one at high undercoolings is due to the recrystallization
   process as a result of the high stress provided in the rapid
   solidification after high undercooling. Dislocation morphology evolution
   in as-solidified structure is also provided by the transmission electron
   microscopy (TEM) technique to further verify the recrystallization
   mechanism.

AB The effects of grain size and environment on creep crack growth (CCG) in
   Ni-base superalloy, UDIMET 520, were studied through experiments at 540
   degreesC. Specially designed solution and aging treatments were used to
   produce gamma ' strengthened microstructures with different grain sizes
   but without any M(23)C(6) grain boundary precipitates. Five grain sizes,
   which fall into three groups (i.e., small, medium, and large), were
   employed. The creep crack growth rates (CCGRs) in specimens with small
   grain sizes were approximately 2.5 times lower than those with medium
   and large grain sizes, as a result of crack branching and the presence
   of some undissolved primary MC carbides at the grain boundaries.
   Otherwise, the CCGRs were insensitive to the grain size. Fractographic
   observations on the fracture surfaces and metallographic examinations on
   the cross sections of the interrupted CCG specimen revealed
   intergranular microcracks and a faceted intergranular mode of fracture
   in both air and argon environments. The test results suggest that the
   formation and propagation of intergranular cracks by grain boundary
   sliding (GBS) is the main micromechanism responsible for CCG in both air
   and argon environments at the relatively low test temperature employed.
   Grain boundary oxidation attack in the air environment simply
   accelerates the crack growth process. The present results are in
   agreement with the theoretical predictions of the GBS-controlled CCG
   model previously developed by the authors.

AB Previously, the effect of hydrogen annealing on increasing the adhesion
   of Al(2)O(3) scales had been related to the effective desulfurization
   that occurred during this process. The simultaneous reduction of other
   impurities has now been reexamined for up to 20 impurity elements, in
   the case of five different alloys (NiCrAl, FeCrAl, PWA 1480, Rene 142,
   and Rend N5). Hydrogen annealing produced measurable reductions in
   elemental concentration for B, C, Na, Mg, Si, P, K, Sr, or Sn in varying
   degrees for at least one and up to three of these alloys. However, no
   single element was I educed by hydrogen annealing for all the alloys
   except sulfur. In many cases spalling occurred at low levels of these
   other impurity, while in other cases the scales were adherent at high
   levels of the impurities. No impurity besides sulfur was strongly
   correlated with adhesion.

AB The microstructure evolution of DD3 single crystal superalloy
   undercooled to 210 K is systematically investigated by employing
   compound molten salt purification combined with the thermal cycle in
   high vacuum. When undercooling is beyond 153 K, the dendrite distortion
   and disintegration take place, and then a kind of complete
   quasi-spherical equiaxed crystal structure is obtained as the critical
   undercooling DeltaT* (180 K) is reached. In connection with the
   observation in the behavior of the crystalline defects, such as
   dislocation, during the refinement process, it is consequently concluded
   that the grain refinement above the critical undercooling can be
   attributed to the recrystallization mechanism.

AB The hot deformation behavior of IN 718 superalloy has been characterized
   in the temperature range 900-1100 degrees C and strain rate range
   0.001-1.0 s(-1) using compression tests on process annealed material,
   with a view to obtain a correlation between grain size and the process
   parameters. At a strain rate of 0.001 s(-1,) the material exhibits
   dynamic recrystallization (DRx) at 975 degrees C and superplasticity at
   1100 degrees C, while metadynamic recrystallization (MDRx) occurs in the
   temperature range 950-1100 degrees C and strain rate range 0.01-1.0
   s(-1). Unlike in the DRx domain, the grain size (d) variation in the
   MDRx regime could not be correlated with the standard Zener-Hollomon (Z)
   parameter due to strong thermal effects during cooling after hot
   deformation. However, it follows an equation of the type d = cexp(-
   Q/RT), where c, p and R are constants, Q the activation energy for MDRx
   and T the temperature. The value of p is very low (0.028) and the
   apparent activation energy is about 275 kJ mole(-1), which is very close
   to that for self-diffusion in pure nickel. The data obtained from
   several investigators are in agreement with this equation. Such an
   equation combines the mild dynamic effect in MDRx with a stronger
   post-deformation cooling effect and may be used for predicting the grain
   size of IN 718 hot forged in the MDRx regime. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

AB Turbine blades in gas turbine engines are subjected during operation to
   triaxial stress fields. For the description of the deformation behaviour
   of anisotropic single-crystal blades, constitutive equations are
   required which take account of modifications to the deformation
   processes caused by evolution of the gamma/gamma' microstructure during
   service (gamma' rafting). A microstructure-dependent, orthotropic Hills
   potential, whose anisotropy coefficients are connected to the edge
   length or gamma' particles, has been applied. The shape of gamma'
   particles remains cubic below exposures at 700 degreesC. At high
   temperatures (above 850 degreesC) the gamma' particles coalesce to
   rafts, and the viscoplastic response of the superalloy is continuously
   modified. This reduces the creep resistance of [001] orientated
   specimen. After tensile loading of the [001]-orientated specimens at
   1000 degreesC, the rafting of gamma' in the (100) plane was observed as
   expected, whereas the [111] specimens did not reveal gamma' rafting.
   Torsionally loaded specimens exhibited rafting only in the near
   [001]-orientated surface regions of the specimen. The deformation in the
   [111] tensile and [001] torsion specimens occurred by octahedral slip of
   dislocations and not by cubic slip, as expected from theoretical
   considerations. Rafting did not occur in the [111]-orientated specimens.
   This anisotropy change is simulated successfully by the
   microstructure-dependent model.

   selective rare earths and having with combination of very low thermal
   expansion coefficient, high resistance to stress accelerated grain
   boundary oxygen embrittlement and fairly good notch-bar rupture strength
   has been successfully developed. The resistance to oxidation for long
   time exposure at high temperatures and the stress rupture life improves
   significantly with trace yttrium additions. The microstructures of the
   alloy have been studied by means of analytical electron microscopy and
   chemical analysis techniques. The results reveal that the rare earth
   element segregates in the strengthening phase of platelet morphology.
   Further it helps in transforming A(3)B type epsilon phase into A(5)B
   type H phase. The morphology and crystal structures of the grain
   boundary phases also change with selective additions of rare earth
   elements. The platelet precipitates become smaller and denser, and forms
   within the grains and along the grain boundaries with the additions of
   rare earth elements. The segregation of the platelet precipitates within
   the grains is helpful in improving the strength of the alloy. In
   addition its precipitation along the grain boundaries can improve the
   resistance to stress accelerated grain boundary oxidation and stress
   rupture property of the alloy and thereby contributed to its excellent
   elevated temperature stability. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S.A. All

AB Two-layer structure thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) (NiCoCrAlY [bond
   coat] + [6-8 wt.%] Y(2)O(3)-stabilized ZrO(2) [YSZ top coat]) were
   deposited by electron beam physical vapor deposition (EB-PVD) on a
   Ni-base superalloy. Pre-treatments were carried out in a vacuum to
   improve the oxidation resistance of the bond coat, and the thermal
   cyclic life of the TBC system was investigated through thermal cyclic
   tests. It was found that the pre-treatments in the vacuum at 1273 K
   increased the thermal cyclic life of the TBCs by improving the oxidation
   resistance of the bond coat. The results of thermal cyclic tests
   indicated that the TBCs prepared by EB-PVD were degraded mainly at the
   interface between the bond coat and ceramic coat, due to the spallation
   of the YSZ top coat from the bond coat. According to the results of
   microstructure observation and composition analysis, the mechanism of
   failure was proposed as follows: micro-cracks are first initiated in the
   YSZ top coat along columnar boundaries, and then propagate through the
   whole top coat. The cracks formed at the thermal growth oxide (TGO)
   layer, due to the growing micro-cracks, are considered to cause abnormal
   thermally-grown oxides of the bond coat beneath the cracks, and
   consequently, the build-up stresses due to the volume increase, which
   are significant in weakening the interface combination of the top coat
   and bond coat. During the following cooling process, compressive
   stresses are introduced, which tend to separate the YSZ top coat from
   the bond coat, and finally cause the occurrence of the failure of TBC
   system. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.

AB IN738LC is a Ni-base cast superalloy used in land-base gas turbines and
   aerospace applications. As in other superalloys gamma' precipitates
   contribute to strengthening of this alloy at high temperatures. In this
   study, the authors investigate the characteristics and mechanisms of
   precipitate dissolution into the matrix solid solution. The precipitates
   grow in cuboidal shape up to 1130 degrees C, above that a duplex-size
   precipitate microstructure sets in upon quenching from the temperature
   range 1140-1150 degrees C. The duplex-size precipitate microstructure
   consists of two very distinct sizes of precipitates (fine and coarse).
   Holding for longer times in the temperature range 1140-1150 degrees C
   does not coarsen the fine precipitates of the duplex microstructure. The
   source for the formation of the fine precipitates in the duplex
   microstructure is the dissolution of the newly grown smaller-sized
   precipitates when the agings start from fine size precipitates and the
   "corner dissolution" of coarse precipitates when the starting
   microstructure consists of the maximum-sized cuboidal precipitates. At
   and above 1160 degrees C, the duplex as well as the coarse precipitate
   microstructures dissolve to form a single-size fine precipitate
   microstructure upon quenching from any temperature up to 1225 degrees C.
   A single-phase solid solution with no precipitates is obtained only upon
   quenching from 1235 degrees C or above. The dissolution of coarse
   precipitates and formation of the fine ones are found to be very fast
   processes in the corresponding temperature ranges. The fine precipitates
   are postulated to form during quenching from the temperature range
   1140-1225 degrees C and are considered to be of the "cooling" type. (C)

   times of 1 and 10 min. duration introduced in peak tension and
   compression strain. The cyclic stress response of the alloy was
   characterized by an initial hardening, a softening and a saturation
   regime. Further, at 923 K, the cyclic stress response was found to
   increase with increase in the duration of the hold. Tension hold was
   observed to be more damaging than compression hold, and the fatigue life
   decreased with increase in the duration of the hold in tension.
   Accelerated intergranular crack initiation and propagation reduced
   fatigue life under hold times in tension. Moreover, oxidation was found
   to reduce fatigue life under long hold periods.

AB The high Cr, Ni base superalloy IN738LC has been directionally
   solidified on both laboratory and industrial scales using Bridgman and
   liquid metal cooling (LMC) methods respectively. In the Bridgman
   experiments, cylindrical rods were grown using a graphite chill with
   temperature gradient G = 5.0 K mm(-1) and a water cooled copper chill
   with G = 8(.)5 K mm(-1) and a wide range of withdrawal rates of R = 60,
   120, 240, 600, and 1200 mm h(-1). In the LMC rigs, several turbine
   blades were grown using a wide range of withdrawal rates of R = 120,
   225, 330, 420, and 630 mm h(-1). Grain and dendritic structures in both
   cylindrical and turbine blade specimens were evaluated in longitudinal
   and transverse directions, Dendritic segregation of rods was determined
   with SEM as a function of processing parameters. Some specimens were
   given a two stage heat treatment followed by tension tests at 25 and 650
   degrees C and creep tests at 152 MPa and 982 degrees C, 340 MPa and 850
   degrees C, and 586 MPa and 760 degrees C. It was shown that at R = 600
   mm h(-1) with water cooled copper chill, directionally solidified rods
   with a well orientated dendritic structure and better segregation
   pattern gives higher tensile properties at 25 degrees C and creep
   properties at 340 MPa and 850 degrees C. Tension and creep tests of
   turbine blades showed that although the yield and tensile strength of
   directionally solidified specimens are in the range of conventionally
   cast ones, the creep properties of the blades have been significantly
   improved using the LMC process.

AB Thermal analysis is often used to determine equilibrium phase boundary
   temperatures such as the liquidus. Accurate measurements require proper
   calibration procedures, which are standard for given instruments. In
   multicomponent alloys such as RENE N5 and PWA1484 superalloys, a complex
   melting behavior associated with the solidification structure was
   exposed by examining the melting response at different heating rates.
   The observed variability in the melting signal is related to the sample
   processing history and is not addressed by the various standard
   calibration methods or supplemental procedures for different heating
   rates. The liquidus temperature can be determined under conditions
   approaching full compositional equilibrium by the application of an
   interrupted-heating thermal analysis protocol. The approach provides a
   new strategy for the reliable determination of phase boundary
   temperatures by thermal analysis.

AB Forming and forging processes are among the oldest and most important
   materials related technologies. New materials technologies centre on the
   development and widespread use of thermomechanical processing,
   particularly for aerospace alloys and concepts of metal workability and
   formability. Workability refers to the relative ease with which a metal
   can be shaped through plastic deformation. The term workability is often
   used interchangeably with the term formability, which is preferred for
   the shaping of sheet metal parts. However, workability is usually used
   to refer to the shaping of materials by such bulk deformation processes
   as forging, extrusion, and rolling. The characterisation of mechanical
   behaviour of a material by tension testing measures two different types
   of mechanical property: strength properties (such as yield strength and
   ultimate tensile strength) and ductility properties (such as percentage
   elongation and reduction in area). Similarly, the evaluation of
   workability involves both the measurement of the resistance to
   deformation (strength) and determination of the extent of possible
   plastic deformation before fracture (ductility). Therefore, a complete
   description of the workability of a material is specified by its flow
   stress dependence on processing variables (for example strain, strain
   rate, preheat temperature, and die temperature), its failure behaviour,
   and the metallurgical transformations that characterise the alloy system
   to which it belongs. However, the major emphasis in workability is on
   measurement and prediction of limit of deformation before fracture.
   Therefore, the emphasis in the present review article is on methods for
   determining the extent of deformation a metal can withstand before
   cracking or fracture occurs. Flow stress data are essential in the
   development of constitutive equations and processing maps. One of the
   requirements for process modelling is a knowledge of the material flow
   behaviour for defining the deformation maps that delineate 'safe' and
   'non-safe' hot working conditions. These maps show in the processing
   space (that is on axes of temperature T and strain rate (epsilon) over
   dot) the processing conditions for stable and unstable deformation. The
   range of T and (epsilon) over dot for stable material flow useful in the
   development of process control algorithms should be obtained from
   physical quantities, which can be evaluated from the test data. As such
   there is no unique instability theory existing to delineate the regions
   of unstable flow during hot deformation which is applicable for all the
   materials. The designer has to establish a suitable theory on the basis
   of microstructural observations of the flow localisation in the intended
   materials. Various existing theories are reviewed for identification of
   flow instabilities (such as adiabatic shear banding, intercrystalline
   cracking, prior particle boundary cracking in powder compacts, wedge
   cracking) during hot deformation of materials, and these theories are
   verified by considering the flow stress data of IN 718 and the reported
   microstructural observations from different sources.

AB MP35N (35% Co, 35% Ni, 20% Cr, and 10% Mo) is a superalloy that exhibits
   a remarkable combination of high strength and high fracture toughness.
   This alloy derives its strength mainly from two processes - cold work
   and a subsequent aging heat treatment. This study examines the influence
   of the amount of cold-work, imposed in the drawing and the rolling
   processes, and the subsequent aging heat treatment on the strength and
   ductility (which is also an indicator of toughness) of this alloy. It
   was found that high levels of cold-work followed by the aging heat
   treatments resulted in a drastic drop in the ductility of the alloy.
   This drastic loss of ductility was correlated with appearance of
   macro-scale shear bands in the samples. The physical origin of these
   localized shear bands is investigated in this paper. Furthermore, this
   study established a processing window for MP35N (in cold-drawing and
   cold-rolling processes) where the aging heat treatment provides the
   desired increase in the strength without adversely influencing the
   ductility of the alloy. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights

AB Epitaxial laser metal forming (E-LMF) is presented as a new cladding
   technique which combines the advantage of near-net-shape manufacturing
   with a close control of the solidification microstructure. E-LMF is a
   process where metal powder is injected into a molten pool formed by
   controlled laser heating. Laser surface treatment has the advantage that
   heat input is very localised, thus leading to large temperature
   gradients. This is used, in unison with closely controlled
   solidification velocities, to stabilise the columnar dendritic growth,
   thereby avoiding nucleation and growth of equiaxed grains in the laser
   clad. It is possible with this technique to deposit a single crystal
   clad by epitaxial growth onto a single crystal substrate. In this paper,
   the microstructure obtained by E-LMF is analysed by scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM), optical microscopy (OM) and indexing electron
   backscattered diffraction (EBSD) patterns. In particular, the grain
   structure formation in the deposit during the process and the influence
   of a subsequent heat treatment on precipitation and recrystallisation is
   characteriscd. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper we consider the development of a computer modelling tool
   for the thermomechanical cogging of alloy Inconel(R) 718. The cogging
   process is used widely by suppliers of aerospace materials, to break
   down the as-cast ingot microstructure to an acceptable level of
   refinement prior to disc forging. The commercially available
   viscoplastic finite element software Forge3(R) has been employed to
   simulate the cogging process and to calculate the variables such as
   temperature, strain-rate and effective strain. In addition, a
   microstructural model has been incorporated into the code, which relates
   the volume fraction of recrystallised material and the associated grain
   size, to the state variables. Since dynamic and static recrystallisation
   phenomena govern microstructural evolution in this alloy the logic
   relating the recrystallisation regimes has also been incorporated into
   the code. In order to validate the process model, results are compared
   to maps of observed microstructure in the as-cogged billet.

   nickel base superalloy under thermomechanical fatigue (TMF) are
   described. The systems investigated were diffusion platinum aluminide
   coatings, Co-Ni-Cr-Al-Y overlay coatings, and thermal barrier coatings
   (TBCs). The TMF experiments were carried out on hollow specimens over a
   temperature range from 300 to 1050 degrees C, at strain ranges Delta
   epsilon = 0.5 and 0.7%, and at a strain ratio R = -infinity. No coating
   cracking was found for the platinum aluminide coating. Instead,
   specimens failed owing to oxidation induced crack initiation from the
   uncoated inner surface of the hollow testpieces, although coating
   surface roughening caused by non-homogeneous oxidation was observed. For
   the overlay coating, roughening in terms of coating rumpling and coating
   cracking occurred, resulting in reduced TMF life, For TBC-specimens with
   a thin ceramic coating processed by electron beam-physical vapour
   deposition (EB-PVD), TMF life was compatible with that of specimens with
   the overlay coating. Failure once again occurred owing to Co-Ni-Cr-Al-Y
   bond coat cracking and propagation into the substrate. In this system,
   some bond coat cracks penetrated through the top ceramic coat although
   others did not. In contrast with specimens coated with the overlay
   alone, no significant rumpling on the bond coat surface was observed and
   the crack density was low. MST/4233.

   superalloy have been investigated using materials of normal commercial
   composition and two melts with additions of 22 and 30 ppm nitrogen. It
   was found that the ductility, tensile life, and stress-rupture life of
   the conventional castings dramatically decreased with the increase of
   nitrogen content, but, in the longitudinal direction of DS samples,
   these properties were independent of nitrogen within the contents
   studied. The transverse tensile rupture life of DS castings had no
   significant change with nitrogen, except for some decrease in elongation
   of the sample containing 30 ppm N. The stress-rupture life and
   elongation in the transverse direction of the DS samples were improved
   at the 22 ppm nitrogen level, which might be attributed to the dendrite
   refining. Increasing the nitrogen content resulted in a change in
   carbide morphology from that of a "Chinese script" to a blocky form and
   a change in microporosity formation, especially in the conventional
   castings. The increased nitrogen content resulted in a significant
   reduction in the volume fraction of eutectic microconstituents and the
   in dendrite refinement in DS samples, but nitrogen content did not

   bond coating interface where a detrimental reaction takes place and
   forms various reaction products during thermal aging, is studied in
   detail. Formation kinetics and physical properties of the reaction layer
   are evaluated by means of Impedance Spectroscopy (IS). Specimens aged at
   higher temperature and a longer aging time shows larger impedance. The
   impedance behavior of TBC and bond coating is found to be markedly

AB An investigation of microstructural development in transient liquid
   phase bonds between the B2 type intermetallic compound NiAl and a
   nickel-base superalloy MM-247 is presented in this paper. The bonds
   discussed in the paper employed pure copper interlayers. Based on
   edge-on transmission electron microscopy investigations, the paper
   examines both microstructural development at the bond-line and the
   influence of bonding on the adjacent substrates. The paper considers the
   epitaxial growth of the B2 type beta (nominally NiAl) phase into the
   joint and the formation of non-epitaxial beta-phase layers. The paper
   also examines the formation of second-phases, including the L1(2) type
   gamma'-phase (nominally Ni(3)(Al, Ti)), MX type carbides, sigma-phase
   intermetallics and elemental chromium and tungsten.
   Bond-line and adjacent substrate microstructures for the NiAl/Cu/MM-247
   bonds are correlated with joint mechanical properties determined by
   room-temperature shear testing. The paper compares the microstructure
   and mechanical properties of NiAl/Cu/MM-247 bonds with those of
   NiAl/Cu/Ni joints. (C) 1999 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB The evolution of different microstructural features in the superalloy
   IN738LC, held in the temperature range 1120 to 1250 degrees C and water
   quenched, is investigated in this study. The gamma' precipitate formed
   in IN738LC grows continuously in cuboidal shape at temperatures up to
   1130 degrees C, but a distinct duplex-size (very fine + coarse)
   precipitate morphology develops when the alloy is water quenched from
   the range 1140 to 1150 degrees C. Quenching from 1160 to 1225 degrees C
   produces a single fine-size precipitate microstructure, while analogous
   quenching from 1235 degrees C and 1250 degrees C produces no precipitate
   at all. Very fine precipitates (similar to 40 nm size) are formed after
   a short time dwell in the duplex-size range and they grow to the size of
   the normal fine precipitates (similar to 70 nm) obtained upon quenching
   from the range 1160 to 1225 degrees C. The fine ones do not grow beyond
   about 70 nm size in the duplex-size microstructure or in the single
   fine-size precipitate microstructure, even after very long time holding
   at the respective temperature range. Two different heat treatments were
   used to study the mechanism of precipitation leading to the duplex-size
   and the single fine-size precipitates. In Treatment I, fine gamma'
   precipitates (similar to 70 nm in size) obtained after 1200 degrees C/4
   h/WQ (water quenching to room temperature) solution treatment were
   subsequently allowed to coarsen in the temperature range 1140 to 1160
   degrees C. In the second treatment, coarsest gamma' precipitates
   (average size of similar to 700 nm) were first obtained by aging the
   above solution-treated alloy samples at 1120 degrees C/24 h/FC (furnace
   cooling to room temperature) and their dissolution and subsequent fine
   precipitate formation were later studied in the range 1140 to 1250
   degrees C. In the first treatment, duplex-size precipitate distribution
   after quenching from the range 1140 to 1150 degrees C was first observed
   with the SEM after about 30 min of soaking time, after the initial
   coarsening of the fine precipitates and partial dissolution of some of
   them.
   Thereafter, at 1140 degrees C, the coarse precipitates of the duplex
   microstructure were found to have kept on coarsening in the cuboidal
   mode up to about 4 hours of aging, while the very fine ones coarsened
   independently up to the fine size level. On the contrary, the coarse
   precipitates of the duplex-size microstructure were found to dissolve
   more easily at 1150 degrees C after reaching a certain maximum size.
   Dissolution starting from the corner was observed and the cuboidal
   morphology changed to near spheroidal through such dissolution. The
   latter morphology also was realized through particle agglomeration in
   this temperature range. Coarse precipitates obtained first at 1120
   degrees C started to dissolve faster and fine precipitates could be
   obtained within five minutes of dwell at 1140 degrees C. The fine
   precipitates are presumably of the "cooling" type and apparently gain
   shape during the quenching process. It is proposed, however, that their
   embryos, rich in solute content, should have been formed at the solution
   treating temperature in the range 1140 to 1225 degrees C, through
   possibly a spinodal-type transformation, since the fine precipitates
   cannot grow to the size of similar to 70 nm during vary rapid cooling
   under which they have been obtained. Activation energy for the
   coarsening of precipitates (in Treatment I) and for size reduction of
   the coarse precipitates by dissolution (in Treatment II) were calculated
   using the average sizes of coarse precipitates after agings for various
   time periods in this temperature range and quenching to room
   temperature. The values obtained indicate very high activation energy
   (685 +/- 15 kJ/mol) requirement for the coarsening of precipitates in
   the duplex-size precipitate formation zone (1140 to 1150 degrees C), but
   a very low activation energy (85 +/- 20 kJ/mol) is found to be
   sufficient for the coarse precipitate dissolution in this range of
   temperature.

AB This article provides an overview of structural changes that occur
   during the hot working of superalloys and provides insight into the use
   of precipitated particles and other thermomechanical factors to achieve
   desired structures. Examples will focus primarily on alloys 718 and 720,
   which are iron-nickel and nickel-based alloys, respectively. The
   availability of a second phase to control grain size is a characteristic
   of some iron-nickel- and nickel-based superalloys that is not usually
   available to cobalt-based superalloys; processing with and without the
   use of a precipitated phase that influences microstructures will be
   illustrated by the use of these examples.

   CoNiCrAl-coating on the directly solidified Ni-base superalloy CM247LC
   DS was investigated at 1,000 degrees C under isothermal and thermocyclic
   conditions, accompanied by acoustic emission measurements. Furthermore,
   thermomechanical fatigue tests were carried out. Both coatings formed an
   Al2O3-layer. Y had a positive influence on the scale adherence and
   changed the growth direction of the Al2O3-scale. Y-modified coatings
   showed substantial internal oxidation. Pore formation at the oxide/metal
   interface took place in the case of the Y-free coating during oxidation
   in synthetic air as well during oxidation in HCl-containing atmospheres
   leading to a decrease of scale adherance. No crack closure by oxidation
   was observed under thermomechanical fatigue conditions in the case of
   Y-modified coatings on the alloy CM247LC DS. For the Y-free coating in
   HCl-containing atmospheres scale damage could be detected by accoustic
   emission measurements even under isothermal oxidation.

AB Incoloy 908, an iron-nickel base superalloy that was developed as a
   Nb(3)Sn jacket material for Cable-In-Conduit Conductors, has been
   selected as the jacket material for the International Thermonuclear
   Experimental Reactor (ITER) Toroidal Field (TF) and Central Solenoid
   (CS) coils. It has a coefficient of expansion matching Nb3Sn (to
   minimise Je and Tc degradation due to differential contraction after the
   reaction heat treatment). The alloy exhibits a characteristic of
   iron-nickel base superalloys: oxygen embrittlement along grain
   boundaries as a result of heating in an oxygen atmosphere when tensile
   surface stresses are present. For applications using Incoloy 908,.
   techniques are required to control levels of either oxygen or tensile
   surface stresses during heat treatment. R & D results performed to
   develop and qualify such techniques for industrial applications are
   presented. The work has concentrated on establishing the lowest
   achievable oxygen levels inside the cable space during the reaction heat
   treatment and determining the conditions that can be tolerated inside
   and outside the jacket before SAGBO occurs. The results were applied in
   the ITER Model Coil programmes, in which about 5.5 km of conductor have
   been successfully heat treated.

AB Extruded bars of oxide-dispersion-strengthened (ODS) alloy MA-6000 have
   been annealed isothermally as well as in temperature gradients. The
   temperatures used for annealing produced secondary recrystallization in
   all the samples, although the final grain aspect ratio was different for
   each annealing process. Interrupted gradient anneal experiments showed a
   curved secondary recrystallization front, with the surface
   recrystallizing at a lower temperature than the interior. It is believed
   this is caused indirectly by the strain gradients arising during
   extrusion. Grain-orientation analysis of recrystallized material
   revealed that a <110> fiber texture is present, A progressive grain
   reorientation toward <110> has been measured behind the
   recrystallization front using microbeam electron diffraction. In
   addition, changes in the distribution, size, and morphology of different
   types of precipitates and particles occurring during various stages of
   annealing have also been studied, Grain-boundary pinning by the stable
   oxide particles plays an important role in determining the grain growth
   behavior at high temperatures.

AB In this paper, an interesting technical problem is to be solved
   concerning in particular composites with a metallic matrix and with
   continual strengthening fibres. The problem concerns metal transport in
   the liquid condition, using different pressure inlets and outlets of the
   form. The attempt to analyse the bonding among the fibres and metallic
   matrix is described. Analysis of the problem of bonding between the
   fibres and metallic matrix solved. Continuous fibre-reinforced metal
   matrix composites as a technological process is very interesting.
   Casting of continuous fibres is an especially appropriate fabrication
   technology when these materials are to be used in complex-shaped parts,
   or the components of an internal combustion engine. It is also an
   excellent method for producing these materials in thick section or in
   sections containing a variety of fibre orientations. However, casting in
   ambient atmosphere is not as well suited to the fabrication of thin,
   flat sheets, because of the difficulty in feeding molten metal over long
   distances through thin cross sections. If the pouring process is used in
   a high vacuum, we should expect very good or excellent results. In
   preparing the fibre preform, the arrangement of the fibres into the
   orientation, packing density and size desired in the finished part must
   be maintained. However, in both preform preparation and casting,
   significant modifications to the standard procedures must be made when
   casting metal composites. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science S.A.

   IN-100 superalloy has been studied in the temperature range 1000-1200
   degrees C and strain rate range 0.0003-10 s(-1) using hot compression
   testing. A processing map has been developed on the basis of these data
   and using the principles of dynamic materials modelling. The map
   exhibited three domains: one at 1050 degrees C and 0.01 s(-1), with a
   peak efficiency of power dissipation of approximate to 32%, the second
   at 1150 degrees C and 10 s(-1), with a peak efficiency of approximate to
   36% and the third at 1200 degrees C and 0.1 s(-1), with a similar
   efficiency. On the basis of optical and electron microscopic
   observations, the first domain was interpreted to represent dynamic
   recovery of the gamma phase, the second domain represents dynamic
   recrystallization (DRX) of gamma in the presence of softer gamma', while
   the third domain represents DRX of the gamma phase only. The gamma'
   phase is stable upto 1150 degrees C, gets deformed below this
   temperature and the chunky gamma' accumulates dislocations, which at
   larger strains cause cracking of this phase. At temperatures lower than
   1080 degrees C and strain rates higher than 0.1 s(-1), the material
   exhibits flow instability, manifested in the form of adiabatic shear
   bands. The material may be subjected to mechanical processing without
   cracking or instabilities at 1200 degrees C and 0.1 s(-1), which are the
   conditions for DRX of the gamma phase. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science S.A.

AB Creep rupture properties and creep failure behavior in the hot corrosive
   environment by means of adopting molten salt were investigated of the
   plasma spray coated Ni-base superalloy systems with different spraying
   conditions, including the thermal barrier coating (TBC) system with the
   Y2O8-stabilized ZrO2 ceramic top-coat.
   Characteristic manners of the coating failure were observed in the
   different coating systems. The most significant creep rupture property
   degradation was found to occur in the air plasma sprayed (APS) NiCrAlY
   coating system (NA) in accidental and brittle manners, although thermal
   cycle susceptibility of the corrosion-induced premature rupture is
   rather mitigated. On the other hand, the TBC system (NVZ) was confirmed
   to minimize the corrosion-induced strength degradation mainly by virtue
   of effective protection of the coating layer against a general
   corrosion. In this TBC system, however, the existing top-coat defect
   associated with a segmentation structure was revealed to cause an
   extremely localized coating failure because of introducing the localized
   and intensive attack to the NiCrAlY under-coat layer just below the
   top-coat crack-opened.
   A possible failure mechanism and its affecting factors for the coating
   system failure were discussed mainly from the viewpoint of simultaneous
   stress-corrosion effect.
