TI The effect of alloying elements on the dislocation climbing velocity in
   Ni: A first-principles study
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB By using density functional theory calculations in conjunction with the climbing images nudged elastic band method, the effects of alloying elements Re, W, Mo, Cr, Co and Ru on the velocity of dislocation climbing in gamma Ni were studied. The results shed a light on the mechanism of these elements suppressing the dislocation motion by connecting the stacking fault energy and the migration activation energy of vacancy with the dislocation climbing velocity. It is found that the elements can decrease the stacking fault energy of Ni and raise the migration activation energy of vacancy. The changes of these two energies result in the increase of the formation energy and the diffusion activation energy of the jog, thus the dislocation climbing is restricted. The results also reveal that the influences of alloying elements on dislocation climbing velocity depend on the characters of dislocations.

TI Modelling of composition and phase changes in multiphase alloys due to
   growth of an oxide layer
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB A coupled thermodynamic-kinetic oxidation model is presented for the selective, external oxidation of the most reactive alloy constituent of a multicomponent multiphase alloy. The model computes the composition depth profiles of the alloy constituents in the alloy as well as the evolution in the phase fractions in the alloy as function of oxidation time. The applicability of the model is illustrated through several examples. For the isothermal and cyclic oxidation of single- and two-phase binary alloys excellent agreement was obtained between the numerical calculations and the corresponding analytical solutions. For the isothermal oxidation of two gamma+beta NiCrAl alloys with different initial volume fractions of the 0 phase, very good agreement was obtained between experimentally and calculated composition depth profiles. Finally, the effect of alloying additions on the phase evolution in the alloy was studied for the isothermal oxidation of freestanding MCrAlY (M = Ni, Co) coatings. It is shown that for a similar bulk Al and Cr content in the coating, the concentration profiles of Al in the coating after oxidation can be significantly affected by alloying with elements like Co, Ta and Re. Consequently, the multicomponent and multiphase character of the MCrAlY coating has to be taken into account when performing lifetime studies. (C) 2008 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI On the oxidation of the third-generation single-crystal superalloy
   CMSX-10
SO METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND
   MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB The oxidation behavior of the third-generation nickel-base single-crystal superalloy CMSX-10 is examined. Since the in-service performance of the alloy is of the greatest practical significance, a detailed study is made of the microstructural degradation of a turbine blade that had been removed prematurely from a commercial gas turbine engine. The results are augmented with isothermal oxidation tests conducted in the laboratory for 100 hours, at temperatures of 800 degrees C, 900 degrees C, and 1000 degrees C. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis, microhardness testing, and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were employed. It was found that the oxidation of CMSX-10 at temperatures below 1000 degrees C does not produce either Al2O3 or the spinel Ni(Cr,Al)(2)O-4, both of which are found in the internal oxidation zone of the earlier generations of superalloys. Surprisingly, it is demonstrated conclusively that the oxidation of CMSX-10 generates the beta phase (NiAl). This reaction, which to the authors' knowledge has not yet been reported, is termed self-aluminization. The XRD studies demonstrate that the internal oxidation of CMSX-10 produces (Ni,Co)Ta2O6, (Ni,CO)WO4, CrTaO4, and Cr(W,MO)O-4. There is indication that the formation of the delta phase (Ni2Al3) slows the oxidation rate at 1000 degrees C.

AB HAYNES((R)) 233 alloy based on the Ni-Co-Cr-Mo-Al system has been developed for service at high temperatures. The origins of 233 alloy can be traced to a couple of Haynes alloys: 230 alloy and 214 alloy. The former is a premier high-temperature alloy with superb creep strength and is widely accepted in the gas turbine industry. It is also chromia forming. The alumina-forming 214 alloy with its 4.5% Al content possesses outstanding oxidation resistance at high temperatures, but its creep strength above similar to 1800 degrees F (982 degrees C) is very poor. The new 233 alloy attempts to bridge this performance. This paper will present preliminary test results for 233 alloy from the products of the first production heats, including the tensile and creep properties of the alloy, microstructure, oxidation properties, as well as fabricability. These results will be compared and discussed with those of popular gas turbine alloys such as 230, 214, 617, and X alloys. The preliminary test results indicate that HAYNES 233 alloy has a unique combination of excellent oxidation resistance and creep-rupture strength while at the same time being readily fabricable. These properties make the alloy an attractive candidate for a wide variety of gas turbine and other high-temperature applications.

TI A Kinetic Model for Grain Growth in a Polycrystalline Ni-Co Base
   Superalloy with gamma/gamma Two-Phase
SO JOURNAL OF THE JAPAN INSTITUTE OF METALS
AB Grain growth kinetics was studied in a new Ni-Co base disk superalloy with gamma/gamma two-phase structure (TMW-4M3) The alloy was heat-treated from 1100 to 1160 C for up to 100 h after hot-deformation The results indicated that the size of un-dissolved gamma -phase increased with increasing of temperature or time because of Ostwald ripening Meanwhile the grain size of the alloy showed a good agreement with the Zener s pinning model at all tested conditions which means that the grain size can be estimated from the size and the volume fraction of the un-dissolved gamma -phase particles Furthermore assuming that the coarsening behavior of the pinning gamma particles follows Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner (LSW) theory we estimate that the activation energy of the gamma particle growth in TMW-4M3 is 303 +/- 28 kJ/mol (within the gamma sub-solvus temperature range from 1100 to 1150 C) which is close to that of diffusion of Al and Ti atoms in the matrix Therefore we suggest that the grain growth in TMW-4M3 follows the diffusion-controlled growth model of gamma formers in the matrix and the grain growth rate is determined by the coarsening rate of un-dissolved gamma -phase particles

TI Microstructure-sensitive creep models for nickel-base superalloy single
   crystals
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB Microstructure-sensitive creep models have been developed for Ni-base superalloy single crystals. Creep rupture testing was conducted on fourteen single crystal alloys at two applied stress levels at each of two temperatures, 982 and 1093 degrees C. The variation in creep lives among the different alloys could be explained with regression models containing relatively few microstructural parameters. At 982 degrees C, gamma-gamma' lattice mismatch, gamma' volume fraction, and initial gamma' size were statistically significant in explaining the creep rupture lives. At 1093 degrees C, only lattice mismatch and gamma' volume fraction were significant. These models could explain from 84% to 94% of the variation in creep lives, depending on test condition. Longer creep lives were associated with alloys having more negative lattice mismatch, lower gamma' volume fractions, and finer gamma' sizes. The gamma-gamma' lattice mismatch exhibited the strongest influence of all the microstructural parameters at both temperatures. Although a majority of the alloys in this study were stable with respect to topologically close packed (TCP) phases, it appeared that up to similar to 2 vol% TCP phase did not affect the 1093 degrees C creep lives under applied stresses that produced lives of similar to 200-300 h. In contrast, TCP phase contents of similar to 2 vol% were detrimental at lower applied stresses where creep lives were longer. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB INCONEL1 alloy 740 has been identified as a prime candidate for the severe operating conditions of USC boilers. It exhibits the highest stress rupture strength and corrosion resistance at projected operating temperatures approaching 760 degrees Centigrade. Alloy 740 is a precipitation-hardenable nickel-chromium-cobalt alloy with a niobium addition. In general, the issues of welding precipitation-hardenable alloys include heat-affected zone (HAZ) liquation cracking, ductility-dip cracking (DDC), and PWHT cracking. Alloy 740 is a new alloy with no fabrication history that was derived from NIMONIC (R)(1) alloy 263. The base chemistry of alloy 740 is different enough to require study of its weldability. This paper describes the weldability investigation now underway for this alloy. Tomorrow's USC boiler will require the use of thin section superalloys previously used in aerospace applications. Lessons learned from that industry are being applied and expanded to boiler applications up to three inches in thickness. The workscope of this project includes basic material characterization studies to determine cracking sensitivity relative to other well known aerospace alloys such as Waspalloy and INCONEL alloy 718. This information is being used in welding trials to determine acceptable welding processes and techniques which will result in sound thick section, crack free welds. Several weld processes were evaluated relative to welding the INCONEL alloy 740. Gas tungsten arc welding and pulsed Gas Metal Arc welding have emerged as the two most favorable processes.

AB A comparative study was carried out to evaluate the hot corrosion resistance of NiCrBSi and Stellite-6 coated nickel-based superalloy Superni 600 (15.5Cr-lOFe-0.5Mn-0.2C-balance Ni) in the molten salt environment of Na2SO4-60%V2O5 salt mixture at 900 degrees C under cyclic conditions. Hot corrosion experiments were performed for 50 cycles, each cycle consisting of I h heating in the laboratory tube furnace followed by 20 min cooling in the open air. The thermogravimetric technique was used to establish the kinetics of corrosion. The morphology, phase composition and element concentration of the corrosion products were detected using the combined techniques of X-ray diffractometry (XRD), scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive analysis (SEMIEDAX) and electron probe micro analyzer (EPMA). The hot corrosion resistance of NiCrBSi coating has been found to be better than that of Stellite-6 coating. The hot corrosion resistance of both the coatings has been attributed to the formation of oxides of chromium, silicon and nickel along with spinels of nickel-chromium and cobalt-chromium. These oxides seal/plug the pores and splat boundaries, and act as diffusion barriers to the inward diffusion of corroding species. (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Understanding the effects of recrystallization and strain induced
   boundary migration on Sigma 3 twin boundary formation in Ni-base
   superalloys during iterative sub-solvus annealing
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB The formation of Sigma 3 twin boundaries in an experimental low stacking fault Ni-based superalloy containing 24 wt % Co was investigated. Normalized microstructures were hot deformed to strain limits of 0.10 and 0.50 at a strain rate of 0.1/s and a temperature of 1020 degrees C. The hot-deformed microstructures were characterized using electron backscatter diffraction, and were subsequently subjected to a series of iterative sub-solvus anneal heat treatments at 1100 degrees C for one to two minutes. By characterizing the changes in the microstructure and grain boundary character distribution as a function of annealing time, this investigation sought to quantify and detail how twin boundary generation and growth occurs during annealing. This behavior was investigated in the same alloy, but with two distinct as-deformed starting microstructures associated with the different strain limits. The starting microstructures possessed varying levels of intragranular misorientation networks, which were found to have greatly affected the resultant formation of Sigma 3 annealing twin boundaries. Strain induced boundary migration (SIBM) was observed to have been restricted in the iteratively annealed sample deformed to a strain of 0.10. Due to the sub-solvus heat treat temperature, grain boundary precipitates were present in the microstructure which limited the mobility of the grain boundaries and suppressed grain growth. As a result, the expansion in the length fraction of Sigma 3 twin boundaries was limited as a function of annealing time. The sample deformed to 0.50 strain, however, was shown to have recrystallized both upon deformation and subsequent annealing. Although recrystallization was found to largely remove much of the pre-existing twin boundaries, the mobility of the newly formed boundaries during growth of the recrystallized grains resulted in a dramatic increase in both the density and length fraction of twin boundaries.

TI Discovery of a thermally persistent h.c.p. solid-solution phase in the
   Ni-W system
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Although the accepted Ni-W phase diagram does not reveal the existence of h.c.p.-based phases, h.c.p.-like stacking sequences were observed in magnetron-co-sputtered Ni-W thin films at W contents of 20 to 25 at. %, by using transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. The occurrence of this h.c.p.-like solid-solution phase could be rationalized by first-principles calculations, showing that the vicinity of the system's ground-state line is populated with metastable h.c.p.-based superstructures in the intermediate concentration range from 20 to 50 at. % W. The h.c.p.-like stacking in Ni-W films was observed to be thermally persistent, up to temperatures as high as at least 850 K, as evidenced by extensive X-ray diffraction analyses on specimens before and after annealing treatments. The tendency of Ni-W for excessive planar faulting is discussed in the light of these new findings. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.

AB Both aviation and land based turbine components such as vanes/nozzles, combustion chambers, liners, and transition pieces often degrade and crack in service. Rather than replacing with new components, innovative repairs can help reduce overhaul and maintenance costs. These components are cast from either Co-based solid solution superalloys such as FSX-414, or Ni-based gamma prime precipitation strengthened superalloys such as IN738. The nominal compositions of FSX-414 and IN738 are Co-29.5Cr-10.5N1-7W-2Fe [max]-0.25C-0.012B and Ni-0.001B -0.17C-8.5Co-16Cr-1.7Mo-3.4Al-2.6W-1.7Ta-2Nb-3.4Ti-0.1Zr, respectively.
   Diffusion brazing has been used for over four decades to repair cracks and degradation on these types of components. Typically, braze materials utilized for component repairs are Ni and Co-based braze fillers containing B and/or Si as melting point depressants. Especially when repairing wide cracks typically found on industrial gas turbine components, these melting point depressants can form brittle intermetallic boride and silicide phases that effect mechanical properties such as low cycle and thermal fatigue. The objective of this work is to investigate and evaluate the use of hyper-eutectic Ni-Cr-Hf and Ni-Cr-Zr braze filler metals, where the melting point depressant is no longer B, but Hf and/or Zr. Typically, with joint gaps or crack widths less than 0.15mm, the braze filler metal alone can be utilized. For cracks greater than 0.15mm, a superalloy powder is mixed with the braze filler metal to enable wide cracks to be successfully braze repaired. As a means of qualifying the diffusion braze repair, both metallurgical and mechanical property evaluations were carried out. The metallurgical evaluation consisted of optical and scanning electron microscopy, and microprobe analysis. The diffusion brazed area consisted of a fine-grained equiaxed structure, with carbide phases, gamma [gamma] dendrites, flower shaped/rosette gamma-gamma' [gamma-gamma prime] eutectic phases and Ni(7)Hf(2), Ni(5)HF, or Ni(5)Zr intermetallic phases dispersed both intergranularly and intragranularly. Hardness tests showed that the Ni-Hf and Ni-Zr intermetallic phase only has a hardness range of 250Hv to 400Hv; whereas, the typical Cr-boride phases have hardness ranges from 800Hv to 1000Hv Therefore the hardness values of the Ni-Hf and Ni-Zr intermetallic phases are 2.5-3.2 times softer than the Cr-boride intermetallic phases. As a result the LCF properties of the wide gap Ni-Cr-Hf and Ni-Cr-Zr brazed joints are superior to those of the Ni-Cr-B braze filler metals. The mechanical property evaluations were tensile tests at both room temperature and elevated temperature, stress rupture tests from 760 degrees C-1093 degrees C and finally low cycle fatigue [LCF] tests, the latter being one of the most important and severe tests to conduct, since the cracks being repaired are thermal fatigue driven. At the optimum braze thermal cycle, the mechanical test results achieved were a minimum of 80% and sometimes equivalent to that of the base metals properties.

TI Large-area, high-resolution characterisation and classification of
   damage mechanisms in dual-phase steel using deep learning
SO PLOS ONE
AB High performance materials, from natural bone over ancient damascene steel to modern superalloys, typically possess a complex structure at the microscale. Their properties exceed those of the individual components and their knowledge-based improvement therefore requires understanding beyond that of the components' individual behaviour. Electron microscopy has been instrumental in unravelling the most important mechanisms of co-deformation and in-situ deformation experiments have emerged as a popular and accessible technique. However, a challenge remains: to achieve high spatial resolution and statistical relevance in combination. Here, we overcome this limitation by using panoramic imaging and machine learning to study damage in a dual-phase steel. This high-throughput approach now gives us strain and microstructure dependent insights into the prevalent damage mechanisms and allows the separation of inclusions and deformation induced damage across a large area of this heterogeneous material. Aiming for the first time at automated classification of the majority of damage sites rather than only the most distinct, the new method also encourages us to expand current research past interpretation of exemplary cases of distinct damage sites towards the less clear-cut reality.

AB Investment cast components are typically gravity-cast by induction melting and pouring molten alloy into a ceramic mold. Some of the more reactive alloys, such as the superalloys, are melted and cast under vacuum to reduce the formation of inclusions in the casting that can adversely affect their properties. Counter-gravity casting processes developed and patented by Hitchiner Manufacturing Co., Inc. Milford, NH utilize unique methods of melting and casting that fill the mold cavity from the bottom through a single-use ceramic fill pipe.
   Use of the fill pipe ensures that clean alloy enters the mold cavity by excluding the low density oxides that often float on top of the molten metal and are pushed to the walls of the melting crucible due to the eddy currents set up in the molten alloy. In addition, the rate at which the mold cavity is filled can be controlled in the counter-gravity casting processes, which enables casting of components with wall thickness as low as 375 mu m.
   This paper will describe the various counter-gravity casting processes that are currently in production. Results of chemical composition testing, mechanical properties and microstructure of some alloys cast using the various processes will be discussed.

SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB We develop a high-throughput calculation method that rigorously mines correlations embodied within experimental data and use it to direct quantum mechanical techniques efficiently toward the diffusion activation predictions and assessments. The new diffusion activation energies data of 298 binary systems, covering six faced-centered cubic (fcc) host metals of Group I (Cu, Ag, Au) and Group VIII (Fe, Co, Ni) and 76 elements of periods of 3, 4, 5 and 6, are predicted in this work. Furthermore, a new analytic expression, derived from data-mining, has been developed, which sheds light on the delicate relationship between diffusion activation energy and materials fundamental properties. The present approach can be extended to study the impurity diffusion in metal alloys of other complex structures where diffusion activation energies are difficult to obtain from first-principles calculation due to the complex diffusion mechanism. The present results could be used to provide useful data for other material simulation techniques such as CALPHAD or facilitate the choice of materials for technological applications.

TI Corrosion behavior of superalloys in a hot lithium molten salt
SO JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL AND ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY
AB The electrolytic reduction of a spent oxide fuel involves a liberation of the oxygen in a molten LiCl electrolyte, which is a chemically aggressive environment that is too corrosive for typical structural materials. So, it is essential to choose the optimum material for the process equipment for handling a molten salt. In this study, corrosion behaviors of Haynes 263, Inconel 718, Nimonic 80 A and Incoloy 800 H in a molten LiCl-Li2O salt under an oxidizing atmosphere were investigated at 650 C for 72-216 h. Haynes 263 alloy showed the highest corrosion resistance among the examined alloys. Corrosion products of Haynes 263 were Li(Ni,Co)O-2 and Li((Cr,Al)TiO4), and those of Inconel 718 were Cr2O3, NiFe2O4, and CrNbO4, while Cr2O3, LiFeO2, (Cr,Ti)(2)O-3, and Li2Ni8O10 were identified as the corrosion products of Nimonic 80 A. Incoloy 800 H showed Cr2O3 and FeCr2O4 as its corrosion products. Haynes 263 showed a localized corrosion behavior while Inconel 718, Nimonic 80 A and Incoloy 800 H showed a uniform corrosion behavior.

AB In order to make clear the mechanism of the directional coarsening (rafting) of gamma' phases in Ni-base superalloys under uni-axial tensile strain, molecular dynamics (MD) analysis Was applied to investigate dominant factors of strain-induced anisotropic diffusion of Al atoms and nanotexture change of fine dispersed gamma' precipitates. In this study, a simple interface structure model corresponding to the gamma/gamma' interface, which consisted of Ni as gamma and Ni3Al as gamma' structure, was used to analyze the effect of alloying element on diffusion properties. The diffusion constants of Al atoms were changed drastically by the dopant elements and their contents. When the lattice constant of the gamma phase was increased and its melting point was decreased by the addition of Cr or Al atoms, the strain-induced anisotropic diffusion of Al atoms in the gamma' phase was accelerated. On the other hand, the addition of Co decreased the diffusion significantly. Therefore, changes of lattice constant and melting point depending on the chemical composition of the gamma/gamma' interface are the dominant factors controlling the strain-induced anisotropic diffusion of Al atoms in the Ni-base superalloy.

TI On the crystallography and composition of topologically close-packed
   phases in ATI 718Plus (R)
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB ATI 718Pluse (R) is a nickel-based superalloy developed to replace Inconel 718 in aero engines for static and rotating applications. Here, the long-term stability of the alloy was studied and it was found that topologically close-packed (TCP) phases can form at the gamma-eta interface or, less frequently, at grain boundaries. Conventional and scanning transmission electron microscopy techniques were applied to elucidate the crystal structure and composition of these TCP precipitates. The precipitates were found to be tetragonal sigma phase and hexagonal C14 Laves phase, both being enriched in Cr, Co, Fe and Mo though sigma has a higher Cr and lower Nb content. The precipitates were observed to be heavily faulted along multiple planes. In addition, the disorientations between the TCP phases and neighbouring eta/gamma were determined using scanning precession electron diffraction and evaluated in axis-angle space. This work therefore provides a series of compositional and crystallographic insights that may be used to guide future alloy design. (C) 2017 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Inconel alloys are currently being investigated for high temperature applications such as HP and IP valve chest and rotor forgings in advanced steam power plant operating at temperatures of 700 degrees C and above. One of the preferred alloys for these components is IN617. This is a solid solution strengthened austenitic Ni-based alloy containing similar to 23% Cr, 12% Co, and 9% Mo with small additions of Ti and Al which can contribute some additional precipitation strengthening. In the solution treated condition, the microstructure consists of equiaxed austenite containing M(23)C(6) at the grain boundaries and occasional TiN particles within the matrix. Owing to high temperature exposure and the creep deformation processes that occur in-service, evolution of the microstructure occurs in the form of precipitation, precipitate coarsening and recovery effects. This paper discusses microstructural evolution occurring in this alloy in samples that have been exposed to temperatures up to 700 degrees C and for durations up to 45,000 hours using advanced FEGSEM, TEM and XRD techniques.

TI Integrated modeling of molar volume of the sigma phase aided by
   first-principles calculations
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB The volume modeling of the sigma phase is an indispensable complement to the integrated computational material design of technologically important materials, such as high-alloy steels and Ni-based superalloys. The molar volume of the sigma phase is influenced by both the atomic mixing (the volume variation affected by this factor is caused by composition alteration rather than site occupation change) and atomic order (i.e. atomic constituent distribution or site occupancy preference on inequivalent sites of a crystal). In the present work, we developed a new integrated thermodynamic and molar volume model to consider physically both mixing and order factors. The integrated model was built within the compound energy formalism (CEF), enabling the thermodynamic calculations to determine equilibrium site occupancies for the subsequent volume calculations. The model parameters of the CEF were assigned by using the first-principles calculated energies and molar volumes of the complete sets of ordered configurations of the sigma phase, as well as the extrapolated molar volumes of the pure elements in the hypothetic sigma phase structure. Such extrapolation for pure elements is based on the experimental data from the literature and the first-principles calculations. We applied the integrated model to study the binary compounds, e.g. Cr-Co, Cr-Fe, Cr-Mn, Mo-Fe, Mo-Mn, Mo-Re, Re-Cr, Re-Fe, Re-Mn, Nb-Al, Ta-Al, V-Fe, V-Ni, and ternary compounds Cr-Fe-X (X= Co and Ni). The integrated thermodynamic and molar volume databases can predict successfully the molar volume of the binary and ternary sigma compounds. As most experimental volume data were measured at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, and the first-principles calculations were performed at 0 K, the present model parameters are valid at about room temperature and atmospheric pressure.

SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The microstructure of alloy 909, a low coefficient of thermal expansion Fe-Co-Ni superalloy was examined in the solution treated and over aged condition, following a previous communication by the authors on the solution treated and commercially aged alloys. In the commercially aged alloy, only the Laves and the gamma' phases were observed. With some indication, however, of alignment of the gamma' phase along crystallograpic directions in the austenitic matrix. This alignment of the gamma' phase has been previously reported as a precursor to the growth of the e phase from the gamma' phase. Analysis by TEM showed that the platelet phase was hexagonal (NiFeCo)(2)(TiNb) with some variations in the stoichiometry about 2: 1 ratio. Tensile and hardness testing indicated that the presence of the platelet shaped epsilon phase in the solution treated and overaged condition was not as effective in the strengthening of the alloys as the spherical gamma' in the commercially aged and solution treated condition. In addition to the presence of e phase, blocky A(2)B Laves phase was abundant, which prevents excessive grain growth up to similar to 1040 degrees C

AB A study of the crystal orientation and structural perfection of single crystal blades obtained by Bridgeman method from CMSX-4 nickel superalloy at various withdrawal rates between 1 and 5 mm/min was carried out using the Laue diffraction method and X-ray diffraction topography methods as well as electron scanning microscopy. Blades consisted mainly of the regular gamma' phase, with [001](gamma')-type direction close to the blade axis. The angle of deviation of the [001](gamma') direction in relation to the blade axis changes between the blade locking piece and end. The dependence this angle on the distance from the locking piece has been named as the crystal orientation distribution (COD). It was found that the nature of COD changes with a change in the withdrawal rate. The change in the withdrawal rate also results in a rotation of [001](gamma')-type direction in relation to the blade axis. The best blades in terms of orientation and structural perfection were obtained for the withdrawal rate of 3 mm/min. (C) 2010 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

TI Effects of alloying elements on elastic properties of Ni by
   first-principles calculations
SO COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB The effects of alloying elements (Al, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hf, Mo, Nb, Pt, Re, Ta, Ti, W, Y and Zr) on the elastic constants (c(ij)'s) of Ni have been investigated using first-principles calculations within the generalized gradient approximation. The results are compared with the available experimental data and analyzed based on the volume changes and electron density. It is found that the shear modulus decreases with increasing volume caused by alloying addition and the bulk modulus (B) is related to the total molar volume (V-m) and electron density (n) with the relationship, n proportional to root B/V-m. The melting temperatures of Ni-X dilute solutions calculated from the available thermodynamic databases have been compared to those obtained from the empirical relationship with the elastic constant c(11). The calculated elastic constants show good relationships with the mechanical properties such as 0.2% flow stress and give us a guideline to understand and develop Ni-based superalloys.

TI Factors affecting the microstructure of platinum-modified aluminide
   coatings during a vapor phase aluminizing process
SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB Platinum (Pt)-modified aluminide coatings were developed by electroplating a thin layer of Pt followed by an industrial vapor phase aluminizing process. The goal of this work was to systematically investigate the effect of critical coating process parameters (such as the electroplated Pt thicknesses, Al contents in Cr-Al nuggets, diffusion heat treatments) and substrates on the final Pt-modified aluminide coatings. Surface morphology and cross-section microstructure of the developed coatings were inspected and compared by using Optical Microscope, Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). Experimental results showed that the Al and/or Pt increase shall favor the formation of xi-PtAl(2) phase; transformation of xi-PtAl(2) into beta-(Ni,Pt)Al phase can be obtained via a heat treatment process; Cr, Co elements in the studied Ni-base superalloy substrates did not show significant influence on coating outer layer microstructure; while substrate elements affect the microstructure of the coating interdiffusion layer.

AB Both aviation and land based turbine components such as vanes/nozzles, combustion chambers, liners, and transition pieces often degrade and crack in service. Rather than replacing with new components, innovative repairs can help reduce overhaul and maintenance costs. These components are cast from either Co-based solid solution superalloys such as FSX-414, or Ni-based gamma prime precipitation strengthened superalloys such as IN738. The nominal compositions of FSX-414 and IN738 are Co-29.5Cr-10.5Ni-7W-2Fe [max]-0.25C-0.012B and Ni-0.001B -0.17C-8.5Co-16Cr-1.7Mo-3.4Al-2.6W-1.7Ta-2Nb-3.4Ti-0.1Zr, respectively.
   Diffusion brazing has been used for over four decades to repair cracks and degradation on these types of components. Typically, braze materials utilized for component repairs are Ni and Co-based braze fillers containing B and/or Si as melting point depressants. Especially when repairing wide cracks typically found on industrial gas turbine components, these melting point depressants can form brittle intermetallic boride and silicide phases that effect mechanical properties such as low cycle and thermal fatigue. The objective of this work is to investigate and evaluate the use of hyper-eutectic Ni-Cr-Hf and Ni-Cr-Zr braze filler metals, where the melting point depressant is no longer B, but Hf and/or Zr. Typically, With joint gaps or crack widths less than 0.15mm, the braze filler metal alone can be utilized. For cracks greater than 0.15mm, a superalloy powder is mixed with the braze filler metal to enable wide cracks to be successfully brazed repaired. As a means of qualifying the diffusion braze repair, both metallurgical and mechanical property evaluations were carried out. The metallurgical evaluation consisted of optical and scanning electron microscopy, and microprobe analysis. The diffusion brazed area consisted of a fine-grained equiaxed structure, with carbide phases, gamma [gamma] dendrites, flower shaped/rosette gamma-gamma' [gamma-gamma prime] eutectic phases and Ni(7)Hf(2), Ni(5)HF, or Ni(5)Zr intermetallic phases dispersed both intergranularly and intragranularly. Hardness tests showed that the Ni-Hf and Ni-Zr intermetallic phase only has a hardness range of 250Hv to 400Hv; whereas, the typical Cr-boride phases have hardness ranges from 800Hv to 1000Hv. Therefore the hardness values of the Ni-HF and Ni-Zr intermetallic phases are 2.5-3.2 times softer than the Cr-boride intermetallic phases. As a result the LCF properties of the wide gap Ni-Cr-Hf and Ni-Cr-Zr brazed joints are superior to those of the Ni-Cr-B braze filler metals. The mechanical property evaluations were tensile tests at both room temperature and elevated temperature, stress rupture tests from 760 degrees C-1093 degrees C and finally low cycle fatigue [LCF] tests, the latter being one of the most important and severe tests to conduct, since the cracks being repaired are thermal fatigue driven. At the optimum braze thermal cycle; the mechanical test results achieved were a minimum of 80% and sometimes equivalent to that of the base metals properties.

AB The contributions of multiple strengthening factors to the 0.2% flow stress have been studied in a cast and wrought Ni-Co base disk superalloy with varying grain size, twin fraction and bimodal or trimodal gamma' size distributions. The alloy was heat-treated within the gamma' sub- and super-solvus temperature ranges between 1100 degrees C to 1180 degrees C, followed by two step aging heat-treatment. The contribution of each strengthening factor are analyzed by measuring its Vickers hardness at over a structural scale ranging from nano to micro levels and then by converting the hardness differences to the contribution to the 0.2% flow stress on the basis of the empirical relation: sigma(0.2)=2.46Hv. The results clearly show that the contribution of grain boundary strengthening decreased and reached zero with increasing solution temperature. The behavior followed Hall-Petch effect and Zener's pinning model, and strongly depended on the size and volume fraction of pinning primary gamma' that is un-dissolved during solution treatment. Meanwhile, the contributions of secondary and tertiary gamma' precipitation strengthening increased with increasing temperature. The behaviors also strongly depend on the volume fraction of the primary gamma' since the designed total volume fraction of gamma' of the alloy is approximately 0.5. As a result, the combinations of these strengthening factors lead to the maximum flow stress at solution temperature of 1135 degrees C. This would suggest that the primary gamma' plays an important role to optimize the microstructure combination through the solution heat-treatment.

AB The effects of alloy elements on the precipitation behaviours of TCP and gamma' phases in new type powder metallurgy (P/M) turbine disk superalloy Rene104 at the aging temperature of 815 degrees C were studied systematically by a thermodynamic calculation method. The chemical compositions of new type nickel-based P/M superalloy were designed combining with d-electron theory. The results show that the contents of Cr, Co, Mo and W mainly influence the precipitation temperature and amount of TCP and gamma' phases in Rene104. The suggested contents of Cr and Co are 13% and 20.6% respectively, and the suggested content of Mo is higher than W. The results also show that the content ratios of Al/Ti and Nb/Ta affect the precipitation behaviours of TCP and gamma' phases. The balance values of Al/Ti and Nb/Ta are suggested in order to make the alloy having desired microstructural stability and strengthening effect. In addition, Hf also influenced the precipitation behaviours of TCP and gamma' phases and the suggested content of Hf is 0.2%. The main precipitates of the new type P/M turbine disk superalloy FGH98I are gamma', MC, M23C6 and M3B2, and no any TCP phases precipitate. After the exposure at 750 degrees C, 815 degrees C and 850 degrees C for 1000 h, the new alloy still shows good microstructural stability.(C) 2011 Published Elsevier Ltd.

TI STUDY ON PARTITION RATIO AND SEGREGATION BEHAVIOR OF DZ125 ALLOY DURING
   DIRECTIONAL SOLIDIFICATION
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB Segregation behavior is an important problem in solidification process of alloys, which determines their growth morphologies, phase distributions and concentration segregations so that it affects the mechanical properties of alloys, such as fatigue lives, creep properies, etc.. However, the segregation behaviors of Ni-based superalloys are very complex that contain multi-components and consist of multi-phases. The solute partition coefficient is a key characteristic parameter to express the solute segregation level and tendency in a solidification process. In the present paper, the solute profiles in directionally solidified DZ125 alloy with planar interface growth, which was obtained through experiments of quenching during directional solidification, have been measured by electron probe micro analysis (EPMA). The steady state of solute redistribution hardly reaches due to melt flow during solidification process. The contents of gamma' phase forming elements, Al, Ti, Ta, Mo and Ni, along longitudinal direction increase with the increase of solidified fraction, while those of W, Cr and Co decrease. The results show that the solute partition coefficients of Al, Ti, Ta, Mo and Ni are less than unit, those of W, Cr and Co are more than unit. In addition, the solute distribution in solid phase with dendrite growth is similar to that with planar interface growth. Compared the experimental results of microsegregation with the calculated ones of Scheil model and Brody-Flemings model, the Brody-Flemings model fits better with the experimental results. It indicates that the back-diffusion in solid phase would reduce the microsegregation during dendrite growth.

TI Fatigue crack growth under large scale yielding condition: The need of a
   characteristic length scale
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FATIGUE
AB Fatigue crack growth under large scale yielding condition is studied for a commercial base Co superalloys, Haynes (R) 188, for single edge notch (SENT) specimen. Due to very high temperature and applied strain values, it is observed that major crack interacts with micro-cracks pattern. These micro-cracks are found to be associated to strain localization and local high triaxiality stress ratio. Detailed analysis of strain localization and stress concentration was used to define an optimal characteristic length used in a non-local modeling of strain energy involved in crack growth process. To obtain robust and low time consuming crack growth modeling, a post-processing methodology is thus proposed for fatigue crack growth under large scale yielding. This point was successfully achieved for SENT specimen test series to describe crack growth rate. Finally, test driven for another geometry has enabled to validate the proposed modeling methodology.

TI Nano-sized Superlattice Clusters Created by Oxygen Ordering in
   Mechanically Alloyed Fe Alloys
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Creating and maintaining precipitates coherent with the host matrix, under service conditions is one of the most effective approaches for successful development of alloys for high temperature applications; prominent examples include Ni- and Co-based superalloys and Al alloys. While ferritic alloys are among the most important structural engineering alloys in our society, no reliable coherent precipitates stable at high temperatures have been found for these alloys. Here we report discovery of a new, nano-sized superlattice (NSS) phase in ball-milled Fe alloys, which maintains coherency with the BCC matrix up to at least 913 degrees C. Different from other precipitates in ferritic alloys, this NSS phase is created by oxygen-ordering in the BCC Fe matrix. It is proposed that this phase has a chemistry of Fe3O and a Do(3) crystal structure and becomes more stable with the addition of Zr. These nano-sized coherent precipitates effectively double the strength of the BCC matrix above that provided by grain size reduction alone. This discovery provides a new opportunity for developing high-strength ferritic alloys for high temperature applications.

TI Atomic and electronic basis for solutes strengthened (010) anti-phase
   boundary of L1(2) Co-3(Al, TM): A comprehensive first-principles study
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB The crystallographic and electronic structures of (010) APB of L1(2) Co3Al0.75TM0.25 are studied by high resolution transmission electron microscopy and first-principles calculations. Effects of solute atoms (TM = Cr, Hf, Mo, Ni, Re, Ru, Ta, Ti, W and Y) on the formation energy, lattice parameters/distortion, magnetism, and bonding strength of the (010) APB in Co3Al0.75TM0.25 are obtained from first-principles calculations. Comparing to the equilibrium volume of Co3Al, it is found that the volume change of the Co3Al0.75TM0.25 with and without the presence of APB increases linearly with the volume of the corresponding FCC elements, indicating the contribution of the solute atoms on lattice distortion of bulk and (010) APB. Particularly, the strong dependence of the APB energy on the composition is comprehensively discussed together with the available experimental and theoretical data in the literature. The negative (010) APB energy indicates that the formation of (010) APB could stabilize the ordered L1(2) (or the FCC lattice) Co3Al, and the local L1(2) -> D0(22) phase transformation can occur. The physical natures of lattice distortions caused by the fault layers of APB and the solute atoms are characterized by bonding charge density. It is found that the solute atoms, occupying Al site of L1(2) phase and its (010) APB, increase the local bonding strength along (010) through the electron redistribution during forming the chemical bonds with Co, revealing an intrinsic solid-solution strengthening mechanism. This work provides an insight into the atomic and electronic basis for solid-solution strengthening mechanism of L1(2) Co3Al0.75TM0.25. (C) 2017 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Recent advances in coal combustion have made coal a cleaner, more viable source for power generation. Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) plants pair conventional steam turbines and coal gas turbines. The overall efficiency of each system is largely dependent on the maximum operating temperature of the system, which is limited by the available materials. Superalloys have long been used as a turbine material due to their high temperature strength and general resistance to oxidation. Superalloy GTD-111 DS is currently being used as components in steam turbine engine such as turbine blades and discs and is now being introduced to the syngas environment, which consists of H-2, CO, CH4, and H2S in addition to H2O. H2S is highly corrosive and complicates the corrosion process. The high temperature corrosion behavior of a directionally solidified superalloy, GTD-111 DS has been studied using thermogravimtric analysis coupled with metallographic studies. Parabolic oxidation behavior was observed for test environments including dry and wet air. Simulated syngas environments show aggressive sulfidization that leads to massive sample damage. In the case of wet syngas environments, a protective oxide layer was observed which seem to increase the samples ability to resist further corrosion.

TI High Strength, Ductile Braze Repairs for Stationary Gas Turbine
   Components-Part II
SO JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING FOR GAS TURBINES AND POWER-TRANSACTIONS OF THE
   ASME
AB Both aviation and land based turbine components such as vanes/nozzles, combustion chambers, liners, and transition pieces often degrade and crack in service. Rather than replacing with new components, innovative repairs can help reduce overhaul and maintenance costs. These components are cast from either Co-based solid solution superalloys such as FSX-414, or Ni-based gamma prime precipitation strengthened superalloys such as IN738. The nominal compositions of FSX-414 and IN738 are Co-29.5Cr-10.5Ni-7W-2Fe (max)-0.25C-0.012B and Ni-0.001B-0.17C-8.5Co-16Cr-1.7Mo-3.4Al-2.6W-1.7Ta-2Nb-3.4Ti-0.1Zr, respectively. Diffusion brazing has been used for over 4 decades to repair cracks and degradation on these types of components. Typically, braze materials utilized for component repairs are Ni and Co-based braze fillers containing B and/or Si as melting point depressants. Especially when repairing wide cracks typically found on industrial gas turbine components, these melting point depressants can form brittle intermetallic boride and silicide phases that effect mechanical properties such as low cycle and thermal fatigue. The objective of this work is to investigate and evaluate the use of hypereutectic Ni-Cr-Hf and Ni-Cr-Zr braze filler metals, where the melting point depressant is no longer B, but Hf and/or Zr. Typically, with joint gaps or crack widths less than 0.15 mm, the braze filler metal alone can be utilized. For cracks greater than 0.15 mm, a superalloy powder is mixed with the braze filler metal to enable wide cracks to be successfully braze repaired. As a means of qualifying the diffusion braze repair, both metallurgical and mechanical property evaluations were carried out. The metallurgical evaluation consisted of optical and scanning electron microscopy, and microprobe analysis. The diffusion brazed area consisted of a fine-grained equiaxed structure, with carbide phases, gamma (gamma) dendrites, flower shaped/rosette gamma-gamma' (gamma-gamma prime) eutectic phases and Ni(7)Hf(2), Ni(5)HF, or Ni(5)Zr intermetallic phases dispersed both intergranularly and intragranularly. Hardness tests showed that the Ni-Hf and Ni-Zr intermetallic phase only has a hardness range of 250-400 Hv; whereas, the typical Cr-boride phases have hardness ranges from 800 Hv to 1000 Hv. Therefore, the hardness values of the Ni-Hf and Ni-Zr intermetallic phases are 2.5-3.2 times softer than the Cr-boride intermetallic phases. As a result, the low cycle fatigue (LCF) properties of the wide gap Ni-Cr-Hf and Ni-Cr-Zr brazed joints are superior to those of the Ni-Cr-B braze filler metals. The mechanical property evaluations were tensile tests at both room temperature and elevated temperature, stress rupture tests from 760 degrees C to 1093 degrees C and finally LCF, the latter being one of the most important and severe tests to conduct, since the cracks being repaired are thermal fatigue driven. At the optimum braze thermal cycle, the mechanical test results achieved were a minimum of 80% and sometimes equivalent to that of the base metals properties.

TI The thermal stability of topologically close-packed phases in the
   single-crystal Ni-base superalloy ERBO/1
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB In Ni-base superalloys, the addition of refractory elements such as Cr, Mo, Co, W, and Re is necessary to increase the creep resistance. Nevertheless, these elements induce the formation of different kinds of intermetallic phases, namely, the topologically close-packed (TCP) phases. This work focuses on intermetallic phases present in the second-generation single-crystal (SX) Ni-base superalloy ERBO/1. In the as-cast condition, the typical gamma/gamma' structure is accompanied by undesirable intermetallic phases located in the interdendritic regions. The nature of these precipitates as well as their thermal stability between 800 and 1200 A degrees C has been investigated by isothermal heat treatments. The investigation techniques include DSC, SEM, EDX, and TEM. The experimental information is complemented by (1) comparison with a structure map to link the local chemical composition with phase stability, as well as (2) thermodynamic calculations based on the CALPHAD method to determine the occurrence and composition of phases during solidification and in equilibrium conditions. The TCP phases Laves, A mu and sigma were identified in various temperature/time ranges.

TI TEM study of the evolution of sputtered Ni plus CrAlYSiHfN nanocomposite
   coating with an AlN diffusion barrier at high temperature
SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB MCrAlY (M denotes Ni and/or Co) coatings are widely used on the turbine blades to protect the aeroengine at high temperature. However, the interdiffusion between coating/substrate and the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) mismatch between protective oxides layer/coating are the main factors that limit the service lifetime of MCrAlY coatings. In this work, a Ni+CrAlYSiHfN/AlN nanocomposite duplex coating system was designed to improve the weakness of conventional MCrAlY coatings. The nanocomposite coating system exhibited a low oxidation rate in the 1000 degrees C isothermal oxidation test and the oxidation rate constant of the coating system was 633 * 10(-13) g(2) cm(-4) s(-1) at the first 20 h, and then the TGO grew at a low constant of 1.49 * 10(-13) g(2) cm(-4) s(-1) until 200 h. Besides, the AlN diffusion barrier effectively inhibited the interdiffusion between coating/substrate. The evolution of coating microstructures and thermal growth oxides (TGO) at high temperature were studied with the aid of transmission electron microscopy. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Interfacial dislocation networks and creep in directional coarsened
   ru-containing nickel-base single-crystal superalloys
SO METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND
   MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Mechanisms of creep deformation in nickel-base superalloy single crystals in the directional coarsening regime have been studied in alloys with large variations in gamma-gamma ' lattice misfit and phase composition, achieved by Ru additions and variable levels of Cr and Co. Interfacial dislocation spacings established by long-term annealing experiments under no externally applied stress indicate that the experimental alloys have high-temperature lattice misfits ranging from near-zero to as large as -0.65 pct. Variation in misfit influences the stress-induced directional coarsening (rafting) behavior during creep deformation at 950 circle C and 290 MPa. In postcreep deformed material, the density of excess dislocations (defined as the dislocations beyond those necessary to relieve the lattice misfit) at the gamma-gamma degrees interfaces varied with alloy composition, with the most creep-resistant, alloy containing the highest excess interfacial dislocation density. In the directional coarsening creep regime, continued deformation requires shearing of the gamma ' rafts and is strongly influenced by the resistance of the precipitates to shearing as well as the interfacial dislocation structure. A preliminary model for creep in the rafting regime is developed.

TI Selection of optimum cutting condition of cobalt-based superalloy with
   GONNS
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY
AB Machining of new superalloys is challenging. Automated software environments for determining the optimal cutting conditions after reviewing a set of experimental results are very beneficial to obtain the desired surface quality and to use the machine tools effectively. The genetically optimized neural network system (GONNS) is proposed for the selection of optimal cutting conditions from the experimental data with minimal operator involvement. Genetic algorithm (GA) obtains the optimal operational condition by using the neural networks. A feed-forward backpropagation-type neural network was trained to represent the relationship between surface roughness, cutting force, and machining parameters of face-milling operation. Training data were collected at the symmetric and asymmetric milling operations by using different cutting speeds (V(c)), feed rates (f), and depth of cuts (a(p)) without using coolant. The surface roughness (Ra(asymt), Ra(symt)) and cutting force (Fx(asymt), Fy(asymt), Fz(asymt), Fx(symt), Fy(symt), Fz(symt)) were measured for each cutting condition. The surface roughness estimation accuracy of the neural network was better for the asymmetric milling operation with 0.4% and 5% for training and testing data, respectively. For the symmetric milling operations, slightly higher estimation errors were observed around 0.5% and 7% for the training and testing. One parameter was optimized by using the GONNS while all the other parameters, including the cutting forces and the surface roughness, were kept in the desired range.

TI Wear on SiAlON ceramic tools in drilling of aerospace grade CFRP
   composites
SO WEAR
AB Carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites are difficult to cut materials due to their anisotropic structure and extremely abrasive nature of the carbon fibers. The tool materials used for drilling of CFRP composites are limited; thus there is always a strong demand for new tool materials which can be utilized successfully for the high performance drilling process. In this study, wear behavior of different SiAlON ceramics, which are successfully used for machining of various materials such as gray cast iron, superalloys, etc., on the drilling of CFRP composites was investigated, compared and reported for the first time in the literature. Three different SiAlON-based drilling tools with the same geometry were manufactured and tested on the drilling of aerospace grade CFRP composites and their wear behaviors were compared to that of commercially available WC-Co tools. It was observed that the wear of the SiAlON tools occurs as micro-chipping of the cutting edge in the first few holes; then, severe abrasion takes place with further drilling. While SiAlON with high fracture toughness shows less micro-chipping, which occurs at the initial stage (1-5 holes) of the drilling process, SiAlON with high hardness has the highest abrasion resistance at the later stage. The increase in wear of the cutting edge of the SiAlONs and the WC-Co tools causes an increase in thrust force, and consequently, in peel-up delamination, which are desired to be as low as possible in order to achieve high performance from the drilling tools.

TI Influence of milling direction in the machinability of Inconel 718 with
   submicron grain cemented carbide tools
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY
AB The nickel-based alloys have a growing demand in many fields due to their outstanding properties at high temperatures. These properties lead to relatively low machinability, one of the main obstacles to its more extensive use. Improvements in cutting tool quality are one of the key points to overcome the challenges. The decrease to a submicron scale of the grains of cemented carbide tools is one of the alternatives to improve the machinability of the nickel-based superalloys. In this paper, two different grades of submicron grains of uncoated cemented carbide tools, TMG30 (10% Co, S30-40) and CTS18D (9% Co, S20-40), were evaluated in the end milling process of Inconel 718, through a 2(4) factorial design of experiments having as parameters the cutting speed, feed rate, machining direction (up and down milling), and tool grade. The tool life, machining power, and surface roughness were used as machinability evaluators. It was found that the machining direction, cutting speed, and feed rate had a significant influence on the machinability output variables, with the machining direction being the most significant one. The differences in the two tool grades were too small to be statistically significant. Simulations using the finite element method of the effective plastic strain, validated by the measurement of experimental machining power, showed that the up milling presented around 14% more plastic deformation than the down milling, which combined with the work-hardenability of the Inconel 718 explains the shorter tool life of this condition.

TI Oxidation Behavior of Selected Bond Coats Based on the gamma' plus gamma
   Structure and Their Performance in Thermal Barrier Coatings Deposited on
   a Nickel-Based Superalloy
SO OXIDATION OF METALS
AB Three bond coats based on the gamma'-Ni3Al + gamma-Ni microstructure were developed by diffusing pairs of Pt layers and metallic layers with selected compositions into a Ni-based superalloy. Thermal exposure tests at 1,150 A degrees C with 24-h cycling period to room temperature were used to evaluate the thermal stability and oxidation behavior of the bond coats as well as their performance in thermal barrier coating systems utilizing zirconia-7 wt% yttria as the top coat. It is shown that a bond coat developed by a Pt layer and a layer of Ni-6 wt% Re-0.5 wt% Y alloy outperforms the conventional gamma' + gamma Pt bond coats by more than two folds. Most evidence points out that the proper concentrations of Re and Y in the presence of balanced concentrations of other elements, particularly Al, Ti, Cr and Co can significantly enhance the thermal stability and oxidation resistance of gamma' + gamma Pt bond coats.

AB In the present work, we show how conventional and advanced mechanical, chemical, and microstructural methods can be used to characterize cast single crystal Ni-base superalloy (SX) plates across multiple length scales. Two types of microstructural heterogeneities are important, associated with the castmicrostructure (dendrites (D) and interdendritic (ID) regions - large scale heterogeneity) and with the well-known gamma/gamma' microstructure (small scale heterogeneity). Using electron probe microanalysis (EPMA), we can show that elements such as Re, Co, and Cr partition to the dendrites while ID regions contain more Al, Ta, and Ti. Analytical transmission electron microscopy and atom probe tomography (APT) show that Al, Ta, and Ti partition to the gamma' cubes while gamma channels show higher concentrations of Co, Cr, Re, and W. We can combine large scale (EPMA) and small-scale analytical methods (APT) to obtain reasonable estimates for gamma' volume fractions in the dendrites and in the ID regions. The chemical and mechanical properties of the SX plates studied in the present work are homogeneous, when they are determined from gamma' volumes with dimensions, which are significantly larger than the dendrite spacing. For the SX plates (140 mm x 100 mm x 20 mm) studied in the present work this holds for the average chemical composition as well as for elastic behavior and local creep properties. We highlight the potential of HRTEM and APT to contribute to a better understanding of the role of dislocations during coarsening of the gamma' phase and the effect of cooling rates after high temperature exposure on the microstructure.

TI Effective Hf-Pd Co-doped beta-NiAl(Cr) coatings for single-crystal
   superalloys
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB Cyclic oxidation behavior of beta NiAlCr coatings was investigated at 1150 degrees C with emphasis on effective Pd + Hf and Pt + Hf co-doping composition and the concomitant phase transformations and interdiffusion of Pd and Pt into the substrate. Coatings with compositions in the range of Ni-(33-39)Al-5Cr-(2-5)Pd/Pt were deposited on Rene N5 single-crystal substrates and subjected to long-term cyclic oxidation. The Pt + Hf- and Pd + Hf-modified overlay coatings exhibited comparable oxidation kinetics and matched the range of oxidation behavior exhibited by the standard Pt-aluminide coating. In particular, additions of about (2-5)Pd+(0.15-0.3)Hf and (2-5)Pt+(0.15-0.3)Hf among the studied composition range exhibited long lifetimes of >2000 oxidation cycles. A positive synergistic effect between Pd Hf and Pt Hf was clearly observed when comparing the lifetimes of beta NiAlCr-Pd and beta NiAlCr-Pt quaternary coatings with the quinary coatings. Transformations from beta -> 3R + 7R-martensites at low temperature and beta -> gamma' -> gamma + gamma' at high temperature occurred in both Pd- and Pt-modified coatings due to Al depletion to substrate and surface oxide. A greater depletion of Pd to the substrate compared to Pt was observed at 1150 degrees C compared to 1100 degrees C; the interdiffusion coefficients were consistent with those measured in NiAl-NiAl + Pt/Pd diffusion couples. These results are very encouraging in supporting the exploration of Pd-modified coating supplanting the currently used, expensive Pt-based coatings. (C) 2014 Acta Materialia Inc.

TI Fatigue crack growth behavior of a newly developed Ni-Co-base superalloy
   TMW-2 at elevated temperatures
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB Fatigue crack growth (FCG) rates of a new superalloy TMW-2 in air was studied by a fracture mechanics test method. Compact tension specimens were tested under load control with a triangular wave form to investigate the effects of temperature (400, 650, and 725 degrees C) and load ratio (0.05 and 0.5) on FCG rates. The results showed that the FCG rates increased significantly with increasing the temperature. Compared with the creep effects, the results showed that the degradation of mechanical properties and the oxidation assisted crack growth may dominate the FCG rates of TMW-2 at elevated temperatures. Load ratio had a little (at 400 degrees C) or moderate (at 650 and 725 degrees C) influence on the FCG rates, which increased as the load ratio increased. The load ratio effects were successfully accounted for by applying the Walker model. The fractographic observations showed that the fracture mode was transgranular at 400 degrees C and was mixed transgranular and intergranular at 650 and 725 degrees C. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

TI Effect of the alloying element on the temperature-dependent ideal shear
   strength of gamma '-Ni3Al
SO RSC ADVANCES
AB The temperature-dependent ideal shear strength (tau(IS)) of gamma'-Ni3Al and the effects of alloying (Re, Ru, Mo, Cr, Co, W, and Ta) were studied in terms of first-principles calculations within the {111} slip plane along the [11 - 2] and [-110] directions. Based on the predicted volume versus temperature relations, the temperature dependence of tau(IS) was obtained using the quasistatic approach, where it was found that tau(IS) gradually decreased with increasing temperature. For the {111}[11 - 2] slip systems, all of the alloying elements except for Co were found to improve the tau(IS) of gamma'-Ni3Al at the considered temperature. Among these elements, Re was the most effective element, and doping a small amount of Re (similar to 3 at%) was found to increase tau(IS) by similar to 23.5% at 0 K. Next, W and Mo increased the tau(IS) by 20.2 and 18.1%, respectively. For the {111}[- 110] slip systems, only Re increased the tau(IS) of gamma'-Ni3Al while the other dopants decreased the ideal shear strength of the system at 0 K. Interestingly, a high-temperature relative strengthening via W alloying was observed for the gamma'-Ni3Al phase within the {111}[- 110] slip system at temperatures T > 800 K. However, the sequence of the tau(IS) of the gamma'-Ni3Al phase doped with other alloying elements was not altered by increasing temperature. According to these calculations, Re and W at the Al sites can effectively improve the shear resistance of the gamma'-Ni3Al phase, and especially at high temperature. Furthermore, the effect of alloying upon the shear strength is understood by the electronic structure analysis.

AB Cyclic oxidation tests were carried out on simple beta-(CoNi)Al, Hafnium (Hf)-modified beta-(CoNi)Al, Platinum (Pt)-modified beta-(CoNi)Al+xi-PtAl2, and Hf-Pt-modified beta-(CoNi)l coatings on Co-based Haynes-188 substrates at 1050 degrees C in air for up to 4670 h to identify the effects of Hf doping. The results showed that the beta-(CoNi)Al coating reached 0.55 mg/cm(2) weight gain at 1960 h and became unstable, resulting in massive spallation at the sample edges; the Hf-(CoNi)Al coating exhibited stable weight gain up to 4520 h followed by a rapid weight increase, corresponding to the formation of Cr- and Mn-containing spinel phases. Both Pt-(CoNi)Al+xi-PtAl2 and Hf-Pt-(CoNi)Al coatings showed stable weight gain for the duration of the test. Examination of the surface and cross-section microstructure by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) equipped with Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) indicated that the original coating was completely transformed into a gamma-(CoNiCr...) phase in the (CoNi)Al and Hf-(CoNi)Al coatings, leading to the formation of Cr2O3 scales or spinel phases. The beta-(CoNiPt)Al phase persisted to the end of the test in the Pt-(CoNi)Al and Hf-Pt-(CoNi)Al coatings, showing dense, adherent Al2O3 scales. The oxidation resistance from the best to the worst can be ranked as: Hf-Pt-(CoNi)Al or Pt-(CoNi)Al>Hf-(CoNi)Al>(CoNi)Al. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Plasma assisted milling of heat-resistant superalloys
SO JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE
   ASME
AB The term Thermal Enhanced Machining refers to a conventional cutting process in which an external energy source is used to enhance the chip-generation mechanism. The work presented here analyzes the basic aspects and the experimental results obtained when applying an assisting plasma jet to the milling process. This process, known as PAM (Plasma Assisted Milling) has been applied to the machining of three very low machinability materials: a Ni-base alloy (Inconel 718), a Co-base alloy (Haynes 25), (both belonging to the group of the heat-resistant alloys) and the Ti-base alloy Ti6Al4V The study focuses on two major topics. First, the efficiency of the milling operation in terms of cutting speed, feed, axial and radial depths of cut and the plasma operating parameters has been addressed. Second, a study on the alterations of the metallurgical structure and the properties of materials after the PAM has also been performed. The process conditions for the above-mentioned Ni-base and Co-base alloys are detailed. The study under these conditions has shown an excellent performance of the whisker reinforced ceramic tools. In fact, cutting speeds as high as 970 m/min and large radial and axial depths of cuts are possible, driving to a cost-effective machining process. The absence of changes in the metallurgical structure of the alloys after applying the PAM process is also addressed. Therefore, it can be stated that this is a feasible approach to the optimization of the machining process of heat-resistant alloys.. Finally, the results obtained in the PAM of Ti6Al4V are detailed. In this experimentation, a certain level of degradation was observed in the microstructure of the alloy when undergoing the PAM process, therefore the use of this technique is not recommended for this material.

TI Compositional design considerations for microsegregation in single
   crystal superalloy systems
SO INTERMETALLICS
CT International Symposium on Intermetallic and Advanced Materials
CY MAR 02-06, 2003
CL San Diego, CA
AB This paper investigates the role of varying refractory addition levels on the microsegregation behaviour of single crystal (SX) superalloys systems during solidification. Specifically, a series of six Ni-base alloy compositions are set in a controlled manner, such that the chemical effects of Re, W, and Ru can be independently assessed. Each experimental alloy is produced in the SX condition utilizing a modified Bridgman casting process, with subsequent compositional analysis of the solidification structures via standard electron microprobe analysis (EPMA) methods. Qualitative partitioning results indicate typical SX alloy segregation behavior with elements such as Cr, Co, Re, Mo, and W all segregating towards the dendrite core regions, while the gamma' forming elements of Al, Ti, and Ta show favorable partitioning to the interdendritic gamma-gamma' eutectic regions. Both Ni and Ru exhibit ideal segregation behaviour with no favorable partitioning to either phase. Quantitative EPMA results indicate that as the nominal Re level increases, the severity of microsegregation to the dendrite core regions rises dramatically for Mo, Cr, and Re. Remarkably, evidence is presented demonstrating the role that Ru plays in counteracting the microsegregation effects of both increased Re and higher overall total refractory levels.

TI Preparation of a Duplex Nanocrystalline Coating by Magnetron Sputtering
   and Its Oxidation Performance
SO JOURNAL OF NANOSCIENCE AND NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB A duplex nanocrystalline coating was prepared in this study by magnetron sputtering on N5 single-crystal super alloy (Ni: Bal, Co: 7.5, Cr: 7.0, Al: 6.2, Ta: 6.5, Re: 3.0, Mo: 1.5 and W: 5.0, wt%). The novel nanocrystalline coating consists of two layers, the inner layer having the same composition with the alloy substrate for avoiding elements inter diffusion while the outer layer has 7.6 wt% higher Al to quickly ensure the formation of a protective Al2O3 layer. Both two layers were deposited within one magnetron sputtering apparatus that contained two targets. The main target was having the same alloy substrate in composition and secondary target with pure Al. The difference in Al content between the two layers was achieved by controlling the secondary target during sputtering. This study revealed a way for preparing a series of similar coatings with varying compositions and improving performance. After oxidation at 1050 degrees C, a protective Al2O3 layer was quickly formed on the duplex nanocrystalline coating and no TCP phases were detected in the alloy substrate.

TI An Atom Probe Tomography study of site preference and partitioning in a
   nickel-based superalloy
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB Atom Probe Tomography (APT) has been utilised for an in-depth examination of the commercial polycrystalline Ni-based superalloy RR1000, assessing compositions of the primary, secondary and tertiary gamma' phases. Clear differences in the phase chemistries are noted, particularly for the tertiary gamma' to which much of the alloy strength is attributed. Trace amounts of Hf are found to segregate strongly to the primary and secondary gamma' phases, but also exhibit an extended diffusion profile across the gamma-gamma' interface up to 80 nm wide. Ti, Al and Mo demonstrate similar, yet not as pronounced diffusion profiles, indicating assumed phase chemistries may not be representative of those regions adjacent to the gamma-gamma' interface. Within gamma', unique element site-occupancy preferences for this alloy were identified. Finally, the grain boundary chemistry across a gamma-gamma interface and that of an intragranular boride were analysed, identifying the latter as a mixed M5B3 boride rich in Mo and Cr. These demonstrate further the depth of information on Ni-alloys accessible by APT, while the overall implications of results in comparison with other in-service/model alloys are also discussed.

TI Incorporation and evolution of ZrO2 nano-particles in Pt-modified
   aluminide coating for high temperature applications
SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB ZrO2 nano-particles were incorporated into electro-deposited PtAl coatings in an attempt to enhance their performance by exploiting the effect of reactive element oxides. PtAl coatings with and without ZrO2 particles were deposited onto three commercially available Ni-based superalloys: Mar-M247, Mar-M246 and Inconel 718. After aluminising and annealing, thermal cycling oxidation tests were carried out to evaluate the influence of Zr02 addition and substrate composition. Cross-sectional SEM images were obtained to characterise the coatings after deposition, after heat treatment and after 200 thermal cycles. The addition of ZrO2 particles to PtAI coatings on Mar-M-246 and Inconel 718 appeared to increase the growth of thermally grown oxide and reduce its rumpling. However, such effects were not observed for the addition of ZrO2 particles to the PtAI coatings on Mar-M247. The analysis of the coatings on different substrates revealed and elucidated the interactions between Hf, Al and ZrO2, providing better understanding of reactions of ZrO2 and the influence of the substrate on bond coat behaviour.(C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TI CHARACTERISTIC AND FORMATION MECHANISM OF PRECIPITATES AT
   RECRYSTALLIZATION GRAIN BOUNDARIES OF SINGLE CRYSTAL SUPERALLOY DD6
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB Single crystal superalloys have extremely good elevated temperature capability in advanced gas turbine aero engines due to no highly stressed grain boundaries in them. With the removal of grain boundary strengthening elements such as C, B and Zr, the occurrence of recrystallization may be detrimental to their performance. Therefore, recrystallization becomes critical in industrial manufacture of single crystal superalloy blades. In the present study, specimens of single crystal superalloy DD6 were grit blasted, solution treated and aged at vacuum atmosphere, and then the precipitates at recrystallization grain boundaries were investigated by SEM, TEM, EPMA and Thermo-Calc. The results show that a few of M6C carbides precipitate at recrystallization grain boundaries, and their size is about 0.5 mu m. These M6C carbides are rich in W, Re and Mo, but poor in Al, Ta, Ni, the contents of Cr, Nb, Co in them are almost the same as the nominal composition of DD6 alloy. The carbon accumulation at recrystallization boundaries and combination with mu phase forming elements such as W and Mo restrain the p, phase forming. M23C6 phase hardly forms in DD6 alloy due to its high W and low Cr content.

SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB K465 superalloy was thermally exposed, respectively at 850, 950, 1000, 1050 and 1100 degrees C. During thermal exposure, topologically close-packed phases, such as sigma and mu, are precipitated in interdendritic regions where rapid diffusion paths are provided and the TCP forming elements W, Mo, Cr, Co are concentrated. The exposure temperature is shown to have a great impact on the formation and growth of TCP phases. a phase is readily formed at the lower annealing temperature (below 950 degrees C), having a basket weave or multi-layer structure whereas becomes instable at the higher exposure temperature above 950 degrees C. The disappearance of mu phase at higher temperature mainly results from the formation of M23C6 and M6C carbides because they can combine with the larger amounts of the a forming element, Cr. The precipitation of mu phase is mainly depended on M6C carbide, and its morphology exhibits coarse needles or platelets. mu phase is stable above 950 degrees C, and the amount of mu phase reaches the peak value at 1000 degrees C, but is decreased above 1000 degrees C.

TI Strengths and Microstructure of SUS316L Fabricated by Selective Laser
   Melting
SO JOURNAL OF THE JAPAN INSTITUTE OF METALS AND MATERIALS
AB Recently, AM ( Additive Manufacturing) process which can produce highly complex components have been gaining significant attention in both industry and academic research. Numerous metals and alloys have been processed by selective laser melting; Ti alloys, Ni alloys, and Co-Cr alloys have been the subjects of recent work. Ni-based superalloys have precipitated phases such as gamma' and gamma '' phase and Ti alloys and Co-Cr alloys are the multiphase alloys which have phase transformation, thus it is difficult to clarify the influential factors of AM process on strengths of these alloys. In this study, we used SUS316L stainless steel which is a single-phase solid-solution alloy and does not have precipitated phase in order to clarify characteristic influential factors of AM compared with a conventional material. SUS316L was fabricated by selective laser melting by ytterbium fiber laser from fine metallic powder. It was found that the coarse columnar grains grew up along the built direction and the columnar cell structure of dislocations which are induced during the AM process. During the solution heat treatment, the dislocation recovery was observed. AM specimens showed higher tensile and creep strengths compared with the conventional (hot working) material because of the high. density of dislocations. Ductility of AM specimens was lower than the conventional material because of defects due to lack of fusion at molten pool boundaries; furthermore, the specimens whose loading direction corresponds to built direction showed lower strength and elongation than the specimens whose loading direction perpendicular to built direction due to the oriented defects.

TI Structure and Phase Composition of Heat-Resistant Ni-Al-Co Alloy After
   Annealing and Creep
SO RUSSIAN PHYSICS JOURNAL
AB The paper presents research into the structure and phase composition of Ni-Al-Co alloy modified by rhenium (similar to 3 at.%) alloying. Observations are carried out using the transmission electron microscopy. The initial state of the alloy is the state after the directional crystallization. The alloy is further subjected to 900 degrees C annealing during 1143 h. Creep tests are additionally carried out for this alloy at the same temperature and time and 400 MPa load. It is shown that FCC disordered - and ordered -phases are major in all alloy states. Secondary phases are found to be sigma-phase, -phase, Laves and AlRe2 phases. Experiments show that the high temperature annealing changes the phase composition of the alloy. Thus, the amount of the ordered -phase increases, while that of disordered -phase decreases. During the creep process, the amount of the former reduces and the amount of the latter increases. The annealing process modifies the phase composition in secondary phases. It is found that the structural modification caused by the creep process differs from that caused by the annealing process. Thus, the creep-induced modification of the cuboid structure in -phase is stronger than due to annealing. Dislocations are observed in - and -phases in all states of the alloy. During the annealing process, the dislocation density in -phase is higher than in -phase, and vice versa during the creep process. The experiments show that the behavior of the dislocation structures is different during the annealing and creep processes.

TI A new computational approach for modelling the microstructural evolution
   and residual lifetime assessment of MCrAlY coatings
SO MATERIALS AT HIGH TEMPERATURES
AB MCrAlY (M=Ni, Co) coatings are commonly used to protect the underlying superalloy component in industrial gas turbines and aeroengines from oxidation attack. They also function as bond coats for thermal barrier coatings (TBC). The chemical life time of the coated component is mainly governed by the depletion of the beta-phase in the bond coat as a result of simultaneously occurring surface oxidation and interdiffusion between the coating and the substrate. A new computational approach to model the microstructural evolution in MCrAlY (M=Ni, Co) coatings on Ni base superalloys was undertaken in the present study. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and wavelength dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (WDX) was employed to characterise MCrAlY coated superalloy samples after exposure at 1000 and 1100 degrees C. Phases were identified by electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and correlated with SEM/EDX/WDX analyses.
   Modelling of the microstructural evolution was carried out considering simultaneously occurring surface oxidation and interdiffusion processes. A flux based calculation of the concentration profiles and stable phases was performed, taking into account diffusion of all elements in the gamma, gamma ' and beta-NiAl phases. Good agreement was found between the observed and computed phase distributions after specific time intervals. The computed widths of the beta-depletion zones showed satisfactory agreement with the measurements. Additionally, the model was able to predict the formation of a TCP-phase and its penetration into the substrate with increasing exposure time in one of the investigated coating systems.

SO METALLOGRAPHY MICROSTRUCTURE AND ANALYSIS
AB This research work was focused on the performance of HVOF-sprayed 83WC-17CO and 86WC-10CO-4Cr coatings on boiler steel alloys ASME SA213 T22 and ASME SA213 T91 in a coal-fired boiler environment. Both coated and bare steel alloys were subjected to cyclic exposures, in the superheater zone of a coal-fired boiler for 10 cycles at 900 A degrees C to compare the effect of the coatings in actual boiler environment. During the study, each cycle consisted of 100-h heating followed by 1-h cooling at ambient conditions and thereafter thermogravimetric method was used to establish the kinetics of corrosion. Corrosion products were examined by x-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive spectroscopy techniques. The hot corrosion resistance of both the coatings 83WC-17CO and 86WC-10CO-4Cr coating was found better on ASME SA213 T22, whereas 86WC-10CO-4Cr coating showed the higher corrosion resistance on ASME SA213 T22 as compared to 83WC-17CO coating.

AB Pt-modified Ni aluminicles and MCrAlY coatings (where M = Ni and/or Co) are widely used on turbine blades and vanes for protection against oxidation and corrosion and as bond coatings in thermal barrier coating (TBC) systems. The present work shows the ability of a new fabrication technique, the Spark Plasma Sintering, to develop rapidly new coating compositions and microstructurres. This technique allows combining powders and metallic foils on a superalloy substrate in order to obtain multilayered coatings in a single short experiment. Fabrication of MCrAlY overlays with local Pt and/or Al enrichment is shown, as well as fabrication of coatings made of xi-PtAl2, epsilon-PtAl, alpha-AlNiPt2, martensitic beta-(Ni,Pt)Al or Pt-rich gamma/gamma' phases. The realization of a complete TBC system with a porous and adherent Yttria Stabilized Zirconia (YSZ) layer on a gamma/gamma' low mass bond coating is also demonstrated. Difficulties of fabrication are reviewed and discussed, such as Y segregation, risks of carburization, local overheating, or difficulty to coat complex shape parts. Finally, some first results of cyclic oxidation are given. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Effect of Directional Solidification Variables on the Microstructures of
   Single-Crystal Turbine Blades of Nickel-Based Superalloy
SO ADVANCED ENGINEERING MATERIALS
AB Single-crystal turbine blades of nickel-based superalloy are directionally solidified at different withdrawal rates of 0.0017 cm s(-1)-0.01 cm s(-1) aiming to investigate the evolution of as-cast microstructures. The results show that the average primary and secondary dendrite arm spacings,.1 and.2, decrease with increasing withdrawal rate, although the complicated geometry of the blades results in local nonhomogeneity of dendrite arm spacings. The experimentally achieved values of.1 can be reasonably predicted by Ma and Sahm's theoretical model, in which the effect of the secondary dendrite on the primary dendrite arm spacing is considered. With increasing withdrawal rate, the shape of the g/ g0 eutectic varies from a large block-like eutectic island to an interconnected small strip-like morphology. In addition to this, the average size of the g/ g0 eutectic gradually decreases with increasing withdrawal rate. A reduction in the average sizes of the g0 precipitates in the dendrite core and interdendritic region is also observed with increasing withdrawal rate. The microsegregation levels of Al, Ti, Ta, Cr, Co, and Mo are alleviated with increasing withdrawal rate.

TI Second Phase-Induced Degradation of Fused MgO Partially Stabilized
   Zirconia Aggregates
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CERAMIC SOCIETY
AB Magnesia-partially stabilized zirconia (Mg-PSZ) fired refractory crucibles used under vacuum induction melting (VIM) furnaces, are routinely cycled above 1500 degrees C in service, sometimes experiencing failure in under a dozen cycles. This has negative financial implications, given the high value Ni-Co superalloys melted in them. To evaluate aggregate response to cycling, the microstructural evolution of two commercial varieties of fused Mg-PSZ aggregate has been studied within their host refractories, over eight cycles to 1700 degrees C. The aggregates contain 0.1-0.2wt% alumina and silica impurities and at 1700 degrees C, these generate a liquid phase which on cooling, crystallizes segregated secondary phases of spinel, forsterite, and cordierite. These minerals have thermal expansion coefficients that are markedly different to zirconia and the mismatch in volume change rates between adjacent phases leads to aggregate breakdown. Micro-Raman mapping reveals internal boundaries within the aggregates which are attributed to retention of original surface concentrations of alumina and silica on zircon sand particles at the time of conversion into zirconia and which act as the main location for secondary phase development. Crucibles made with aggregates containing higher concentrations of stabilizer (>2wt% MgO) and MgO fines in their matrix phase, show significantly greater aggregate breakdown.

AB The purpose of this study was to produce Co-based Stellite 6 superalloy components by using the method of Powder Injection Molding (PIM) and to characterize the microstructural and mechanical properties of the produced components. The experimental studies were started through the formation of feedstock by mixing Stellite 6 powder with a multicomponent binder system. Prepared feedstock was formed by utilizing powder injection molding technique. Then the molded samples were subjected to the solvent and thermal debinding processes. Different sintering cycles were applied to the raw components for the purpose of determining the optimum sintering conditions. The densities of the sintered components were determined in accordance with the Archimedes' principle. The microstructural characterization was performed through scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis, energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) analyses, and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. Hardness measurement and tensile test were conducted in order to determine the mechanical properties. The results illustrated that the injection molded Stellite 6 components were composed of fine and equiaxed grains, plenty of carbide precipitates exhibiting homogenous distribution throughout the microstructure formed at the grain boundaries and thus the mechanical properties were considerably high.

TI High temperature corrosion resistant coatings for gas turbine components
SO REVISTA DE METALURGIA
AB Hot section gas turbine components are made of superalloys, developed to withstand high temperatures in conditions in which mechanical stresses are high and that require high surface stability. However, during the 50s it became evident that compositions resulting in high mechanical strength for these materials were not compatible with those offering optimal protection from the working environments. The idea of employing protective coatings over materials with high mechanical strength resulted therefore from this situation. Presently, both aeronautic and power generation turbines operate at temperatures within the 900-1400 degrees C, thanks to these coatings, indispensable for their correct operation. In this work, the principal degradation mechanisms in these operating conditions and the different type of coatings presently employed by the industrial sector are described, beginning by the oldest Ni or Co aluminides, following with the addition of other metals such as Pt, Cr, etc. to the former coatings in order to increase their useful life, continuing with the overlay MCrAlY coatings and finishing with the thermal barrier coating systems. Moreover, the corresponding deposition techniques industrially employed to deposit these coatings are described, and finally, an insight of the latest research lines currently being developed is also included.

AB One type of functionally graded coating system is thermal barrier coating (TBC), where the combination of ceramic and metallic coating is used both to reduce the temperature and to increase oxidation and corrosion resistance of the substrate. TBCs usually consist of the top ceramic coating based on YSZ (ZrO2+Y2O3) and the metallic bond coating of M-CrAlY type, where M means Ni, Co or their appropriate combination. Electron beam physical vapour deposition (EB-PVD) or vacuum (VPS), low pressure (LPPS) or atmospheric (APS) plasma spraying techniques are most frequently used as a deposition method. Despite some requirements on the product shape simplicity, the air plasma spraying offers high productivity, sufficient quality and much lower production costs in comparison with the EB-PVD technology. The contribution deals with high temperature structural stability of TBCs of YSZ + NiCrAlY and YSZ + CoNiCrAlY types that were produced by air plasma spraying on the INCONEL 713LC polycrystalline nickel based superalloy substrate. Immediately after deposition, the specimens were exposed to temperature of 1000 C for 5-500 hours in the common ambient atmosphere. The changes in both microstructure and chemical composition were studied by means of scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive microanalysis and image analysis methods.

TI Microstructural and Wear Characteristics of High Velocity Oxygen Fuel
   (HVOF) Sprayed NiCrBSi-SiC Composite Coating on SAE 1030 Steel
SO ARABIAN JOURNAL FOR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
AB In this paper, wear properties of NiCrBSi-SiC coatings were investigated using the ball-on-disk wear test. In experimental study, NiCrBSi-SiC powders were sprayed using a high-velocity oxygen fuel technique on an SAE 1030 steel substrate. Powder mixtures with different weight mixing ratios, NiCrBSi + 10 wt% SiC, NiCrBSi + 20 wt% SiC and NiCrBSi + 40 wt% SiC coatings were prepared. The deposited coatings are compared in terms of their phase composition, microstructure and hardness. It is proved that the degree of mixing of the NiCrBSi and SiC components in the powder has a massive effect on the phase composition, microstructure and hardness of the coatings. Wear tests were conducted on both the uncoated and coated substrates at same normal load, speed, and wear distance. It has been determined that the coated substrates exhibit a very good tribological performance in comparison to the uncoated substrate. The increase in the adhesive wear resistance provided by the coating has been attributed to the presence of a large amount of dispersed Ni and Cr carbide and/or borides in the Ni matrix.

TI Oxidation behavior and mechanism of a Ni-based single crystal superalloy
   with single alpha-Al2O3 film at 1000 degrees C
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB Detailed long-term of 2000 h oxidation behavior of a Ni-based single crystal superalloy was investigated at 1000 degrees C. In the first oxidation stage, alpha-Al2O3 formed immediately, and then the mass gain curve obeys the parabolic law, which corresponds to the growth of alpha-Al2O3 film. A single alpha-Al2O3 film kept on the surface of the specimen before 750 h oxidation. The oxidation is controlled by the inward diffusion of oxygen anions to react with Al cations at the oxide/metal interface. The shape of the exfoliation region of single alpha-Al2O3 film is closed to an annulus, in which the (Ni, Co)O layer formed due to depletion of Al. The three-layer oxide scale formed rapidly after 750 h oxidation. With the continue consumption of Al, a discontinuous inner alpha-Al2O3 layer formed, making oxide scale spall seriously and gain mass rapidly. The states of alpha-Al2O3 film, the controlled film, are different in dendrite core and interdendritic region. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI DYNAMIC STRAIN-AGING IN A NEW SINGLE-CRYSTAL NICKEL-BASED SUPERALLOY
   (CMSX-4)
SO JOURNAL OF TESTING AND EVALUATION
AB Tensile behavior of a new single crystal nickel-based superalloy with rhenium (CMSX-4) was studied at both room and elevated temperatures in two different hear-treated conditions. Detailed fractographic studies were carried out to determine the micromechanism of crack growth in tensile loading. Round cylindrical tension specimens were prepared from the single crystal nickel-based superalloy CMSX-4 in [001] orientation. The test specimens had the [001] growth direction parallel to the loading axis in tension. The specimens were given two different heat treatments to produce two different gamma' precipitate sizes, i.e., 0.3 mu m and 0.5 mu m, respectively. The tensile properties of these materials were evaluated at room and elevated temperatures in ambient atmosphere as per ASTM E 21, Test Methods for Elevated Temperature Tension Tests of Metallic Materials.
   The results of this investigation indicate that CMSX-4 undergoes dynamic strain aging in the temperature range of 260 degrees to 875 degrees C. This dynamic strain aging appears to take place by the trapping of moving dislocations by the substitutional solute atoms (like rhenium, tantalum, tungsten, cobalt, and molybdenum) during the high-temperature deformation process. Fractographs at lower temperatures (T less than or equal to 800 degrees C) exhibit an unusual type of cleavage fracture with several operative slip systems, while at higher temperatures (T greater than or equal to 1094 degrees C) the crack growth process is characterized by a relatively smooth fracture surface, with the presence of dimples created by ductile failure (typical of many nickel-based superalloys).

TI Thermomechanical material parameters characterization of the superalloy
   PN 3601669-7 under low-velocity impacts
SO JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB This work concerns the characterization of the thermodynamic behavior of the superalloy Airsist 215 (PN 3601669-7) containing cobalt. Such superalloys are used in aeronautical construction, in the hot parts of the turbine. They are frequently used for the production of the paddles. The parts in service are subjected to dynamic solicitations and thermal fluctuations over the course of time. They are responsible for modification and degradation of material properties. This can lead to the appearance of cracks and, in the long term, to the rupture of these parts. In this paper, a preliminary physical study is made on the appearance of the cracks, followed by experiments using shocks at ambient temperature and under a heating situation which simulates combustion. It is found that these dynamic loads have a significant impact on the development of the cracks that appear on the segments of the turbine nozzle. The study is devoted to the elastic shock of Hertz-Boussinesq extended to viscoelastic bodies by direct convolution of Riemann-Stielges. The interest resides in the local convolution and the distribution of stresses in the contact zone. The shock excitation method includes a deduced force in the load and disload phases. This force is an impulse which approaches a Dirac function. The sample can be modeled approximately by a system of one degree of freedom for natural frequency, damping and transfer function. The spectral response of the specified shock allows calculation of the damping. Every point of this spectrum gives the response for the linear system of the transfer function. Then, viscoelastic shock parameters are deduced.

TI Characterization of transient oxide formation on CoNiCrAlY after heat
   treatment in vacuum and air
SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB The application of thin film sensors on hot section components of gas turbine engines requires the formation a specific and complex layered structure that is functional, reliable, and durable. In the case of conducting substrates, such as the nickel- or cobalt-based superalloys, an electrically-insulating layer (typically aluminum oxide) is required between the sensing layer elements and the substrate. In order to achieve suitable bonding of alumina to the substrate, a MCrAlY type bond coat is commonly applied to the metallic substrate and the subsequent formation of dense, adherent oxide(s) on the MCrAlY coating surface can ultimately determine the durability of the layered structure In this work, test specimens consisting of a high-velocity oxy-fuel (HVOF) CoNiCrAlY coated nickel-base substrate were subjected to selected vacuum and air furnace heat treatments in order to observe the effects of the heat treatments on the transient oxide formation on the CoNiCrAlY surface. The surfaces and cross-sectional features of the test specimens were examined using scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy dispersive spectrometry analysis (EDS). together with the X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis Of the heat treatment conditions examined, the vacuum heat treated CoNiCrAlY specimens exhibited the formation of a denser alumina layer while the air furnace heat treatments resulted in a more ridge-like alumina formation on the surface Increasing heat treatment temperature and time reduced the amount of transition metal oxide and encouraged more uniform alumina formation.

TI A FREE-ABRASIVE MACHINING APPROACH TO DRESSING OF RESIN-BONDED CBN

AB There are increasing demands placed on manufacturing engineers to improve quality and reduce total cost in their grinding operations. Grinding using CBN (Cubic Boron Nitride) wheels has been well documented in reducing total grinding costs (wheel plus labour plus overhead) on tool and die steels with Re hardness greater than 50 and nickel- and cobalt-based superalloys with HRc hardness greater than 35. Resin-bonded CBN wheels are commonly used in CBN grinding due to their advantages in high speed grinding. However, dressing of resin-bonded CBN wheels is usually a difficulty. In this paper, a free-abrasive machining approach to dressing of CBN grinding wheels is presented. The basis of this method is to indent and drive free abrasive grains on the wheel surface to excavate the binder material between the CBN grains and uncoat the exposed portion of the grains. It is shown that by using the present dressing method CBN wheels can be dressed precisely and efficiently as expected. Experimental results are presented to show the advantages of the present dressing method over other dressing methods in the dressed wheel topography and grinding performance such as the wheel wear, grinding forces, ground workpiece surface roughness and thermal damage. The main parameters in the present dressing method are also considered. It is shown that the wheel topography can be controlled with the average size of the free-abrasive grains used for dressing. There is an optimum value in the grain size, from which the dressed wheel grinds at the lowest forces and highest G ratio. It is also shown that the pressure applied on the dressing plate has a saturation point at which the highest dressing efficiency, and optimum wheel topography and grinding performance can be achieved.

TI The Effects of Tool Position, Coating and Cutting Parameters on Forces,
   Power, MRR and Wear in Face Milling of Stellite 6
SO ARABIAN JOURNAL FOR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
AB High-speed milling is known to be an advanced machining process increasingly used for modern materials such as nickel- or cobalt-based superalloys. In this paper, the effect of machining parameters including cutting velocity, feed rate and depth of cut on tool wear, material removal rate, cutting forces and power in symmetric and asymmetric face milling of Stellite 6 with coated and uncoated inserts has been studied. One hundred and eighty experiments were carried out with different machining conditions. The settings of milling parameters were determined by using general full factorial design method. The analysis of variance was employed to analyze the effect of machining parameters on the cutting forces. Cutting speeds' effect on cutting forces has not been observed. The depth of cut has greater influence on the resultant cutting forces. Experiments show that the milling forces on Z-axis direction (F (z) ) are the highest for symmetric face milling in the table system of cutting forces. The depth of cut and feed rate have greater influence on the resultant cutting forces in the symmetric and asymmetric face milling processes for PVD-coated and uncoated inserts. It is found that if feed rate and depth of cut are increased, the cutting power would increase and the asymmetric milling strategy becomes superior when compared to symmetric milling with more cutting power. Additionally, the end of tool life is more frequently caused by chipping and breakage of the edge rather than regular tool wear because face milling is an interrupted cutting operation.

TI THERMAL-STABILITY OF A PLATINUM ALUMINIDE COATING ON NICKEL-BASED
   SUPERALLOYS
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB An investigation was carried out to determine the thermal stability of a platinum aluminide coating on the directionally solidified alloy MAR M 002 and its single-crystal version alloy, SR R 99, at 800, 1 000 and 1100-degrees-C. The morphology, structure and microchemical composition of the coating were characterized using scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. In the as-deposited condition, the coating was found to consist of two layers. Most of the platinum was concentrated in the outer coating layer which consisted of a fine dispersion of PtAl2 in a matrix of beta-(Ni, Pt)Al containing other elements in solid solution, such as cobalt and chromium. The inner coating layer was relatively free of platinum and consisted essentially of beta-NiAl. Exposure at 800-degrees-C was found to have no significant effect on the structure and composition of the coating on each alloy. At temperatures greater-than-or-equal-to 1000-degrees-C, however, PtAl2 became thermodynamically unstable and significant interdiffusion occurred between the coating and alloy substrate. After exposure at 1000-degrees-C, the components of the outer coating layer were NiAl and Ni3Al. However, after exposure at 1100-degrees-C, the outer coating layer consisted only of Ni3Al. Also, after exposure at both temperatures, the composition of the outer coating layer approached that of the inner layer due to interdiffusion. Although the coating on both alloys exhibited similar structural stability at all temperatures investigated, the coating on alloy MAR M 002 was found to develop a more protective scale. This behaviour was correlated with differences in alloy substrate composition particularly rare-earth elements such as hafnium.

TI Microstructures and Surface Stabilities of {Ni-0.4C-6Ta-xCr, 0 <= x <=
   50 Wt Pct} Cast Alloys at High Temperature
SO METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND
   MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Nickel-based cast alloys rich in chromium and reinforced by TaC carbides are potentially very interesting alloys for applications at elevated temperatures. Unfortunately, unlike cobalt-chromium and iron-chromium alloys, it is difficult to obtain exclusively TaC as primary carbides in Ni-Cr alloys. In alloys containing 30 wt pct Cr tantalum, carbides coexist with chromium carbides. The latter tend to weaken the alloy at elevated temperatures because they become rapidly spherical and then quickly lose their reinforcing effect. In this work, we attempted to stabilize TaC as a single carbide phase by testing different chromium contents in the [0, 50 wt pct] range. Six alloys containing 0.4C and 6Ta, weight contents corresponding to equivalent molar contents, were elaborated by foundry, and their as-cast microstructures were characterized. Samples of all alloys were exposed to 1127 degrees C and 1237 degrees C for 24 hours to characterize their stabilized microstructures. The surface fractions of chromium carbides and tantalum carbides were measured by image analysis, and their evolutions vs the chromium content were studied. For the chosen C and Ta contents, it appears that obtaining TaC only is possible by decreasing the chromium content to 10 wt pct. At the same time, TaC fractions are unfortunately too low because a large portion of tantalum integrates into the solid solution in the matrix. A second consequence is a critical decrease in oxidation resistance. Other possible methods to stabilize TaC as a single carbide are evocated, such as the simultaneous increase in Ta and decrease in chromium from 30 wt pct Cr.

TI Sliding Wear Behavior of HVOF-sprayed Cr3C2-NiCr/CeO2 Composite Coatings
   at Elevated Temperature up to 800 A degrees C
SO TRIBOLOGY LETTERS
AB Four types of Cr3C2-NiCr coatings containing different fractions of CeO2 additive were deposited using high velocity oxy-fuel spraying. Hardness tester, X-ray diffractometer, contact surface profiler, and scanning electron microscope equipped with energy dispersive spectrometer were employed to characterize the microhardness, phase composition, surface roughness, and microstructure of as-sprayed coatings. At the same time, the friction and wear behavior of the as-sprayed coatings sliding against Si3N4 ball at room temperature and elevated temperature of 400 or 800 A degrees C under unlubricated condition was evaluated using an oscillating friction and wear tester. The worn surfaces of the composite coatings and Si3N4 counterpart balls were analyzed by means of scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and three dimensional non-contact surface profiler. The friction and wear mechanisms of the coatings with and without CeO2 additive were comparatively discussed. Results show that the composite coatings doped with CeO2 had better wear-resistance than that without CeO2, and the coating containing 4 wt% CeO2 showed the best wear-resistant property. The improved wear-resistant properties of the composite coatings doped with CeO2 were attributed to the refined microstructure and improved mechanical properties induced by CeO2.

TI Microstructural characterization of a new mechanically alloyed Ni-base
   ODS superalloy powder
SO MATERIALS CHARACTERIZATION
AB The microstructure of a new Ni-base oxide dispersion strengthened superalloy powder was studied for high temperature gas turbine.applications after the mechanical alloying process. In this study, an atomized powder with a composition similar to the CMSX-10 superalloy was mechanically alloyed with yttria and Hf powders. The mechanically alloyed powder included only the supersaturated solid solution gamma phase without gamma' and yttria provided by severe plastic deformation, while after the 3-step aging, the gamma' phase was precipitated due to the partitioning of Al and Ta to the gamma' and Co, Cr, Re, W, and Mo to the gamma phase. Mechanical alloying modified the morphology of gamma' to the new coherent gamma-gamma' nanoscale lamellar structure to minimize the elastic strain energy of the precipitation, which yielded a low lattice misfit of 0.16% at high temperature. The gamma' lamellae aligned preferentially along the elastically soft [100] direction. Also, the precipitated oxide particles were refined in the gamma phase by adding Hf from large incoherent YAlO3 to fine semi-coherent Y2Hf2O7 oxide particles with the average size of 7 nm and low interparticle spacing of 76 nm.

   Superalloy: Effect of Homogenization Design
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING AND PERFORMANCE
AB Co-based FSX-414 superalloy is especially used for first-stage nozzles of gas turbines. Transient liquid phase (TLP) bonding has potential as repair process for these nozzles. In this study, homogenization of TLP-bonded FSX-414 superalloy at optimum bonding condition (1150 A degrees C/5 min) was conducted at 1175, 1200, and 1225 A degrees C for 1, 3, and 6 h. Homogenization at 1175 A degrees C/1 h had no effect on removing the diffusion-affected zone (DAZ) phases. Increasing the time to 6 h was effective in removing DAZ phases and boride phases formed due to liquefaction, but compositional homogenization was not complete. Homogenization at 1200 A degrees C for 1 h caused boride phases to form adjacent to the joint and in the base metal. By increasing the time to 3 h produced joint, free of these phases. At 1225 A degrees C/3 h homogenization condition, using a Ni-etchant and EDS analysis across the joint showed appropriate combination of compositional and microstructural homogenization including removed DAZ phases. The highest hardness, the most uniform hardness profile across the joint, and the highest shear strength (91% of the base metal strength) in addition to the microstructural features showed the best joints homogenizing at 1225 A degrees C for 3 h.

TI Crack formation and microstructure-sensitive propagation in low cycle
   fatigue of a polycrystalline nickel-based superalloy with different heat
   treatments
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FATIGUE
AB Gas turbine engine materials demand high performance of fatigue life under alternative loading. In this paper, crack initiation and propagation in the low cycle fatigue (LCF) of a polycrystalline nickel based superalloys was studied via experimental and numerical methods. LCF experiments were conducted with the specimens subjected to different heat treatment regimes, including of standard heat treatment (SHT), heat isostatic pressing (HIP), and combined heat treatment (HIP + SHT). Simulations based on finite element method (FEM) were implemented with the 3D digital model obtained from synchrotron radiation X-ray computerized tomography (CT) to investigate the effect of microporosity. Results indicated that microporosity was a dominant factor of fatigue crack and the parameters of microporosity including of porosity, effective diameter, and distribution co-contributed to affect fatigue life. The delta stack and carbide were observed to be fatigue crack sites. The HIP specimen had long fatigue cycle life since casting pore and acicular delta were eliminated, while further SHT can reintroduce delta into matrix resulting in high strength and low fatigue life. LCF crack behaviors in HIP + SHT superalloy depended on surface quality, stress concentration, and the quantity of carbide.

AB Iridium is one of the most promising base metals for future high-temperature structural materials. Attempts to improve the high-temperature strength of Ir have involved solid-solution hardening and coherent hardening. Hf and Zr having a larger atomic size misfit with Ir were found to be the most effective solid-solution hardening and coherent hardening elements on In The idea of multi-component alloying Ir by Hf and Zr was used for the improvement of high-temperature properties of Ir-based alloys in this work. The results show that the monolithic saturated fcc phase has an outstanding Vickers hardness at room temperature, whereas a dual-phase fcc/L1(2) structure is favorable for high-temperature strength and creep resistance. With a dual-phase fcc/L1(2), structure composed mostly of fcc phase, the Ir-5Hf-5Zr alloy has a 0.2% yield strength as high as 175 MPa, and a stable creep rate as low as 1.33 x 10(-7) S-1 at a stress of 40 MPa even at 1950 degrees C. Finally, a principle for the design of Ir-based alloy based upon the composition and microstructural morphology was discussed. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The L21-structure Fe2AlTi intermetallic compound is one of the two phases identified in Fe-Al-Ti superalloy nanocomposites. Experimental data related to low-temperature magnetic properties of this Heusler compound indicate that magnetic moment is about 0.1 Bohr magneton per formula unit. In contrast, previous quantum-mechanical calculations predicted Fe2AlTi to have much higher magnetic moment, 0.9 Bohr magneton per formula unit. In order to solve this discrepancy between the theory and experiment we have performed a series of quantum-mechanical fix-spin-moment calculations and compared our results with those for non-magnetic state. It turns out that the total energy of the non-magnetic state is only by 10.73 meV/atom higher than that of the magnetic state. When applying Boltzmann statistics to this very small energy difference we predict that the non-magnetic state appears at non-zero temperatures with significant probabilities (for instance, 22.36 % at T = 100 K) and reduces the overall magnetic moment. As another mechanism lowering the magnetization we studied selected shape deformations, in particular trigonal shearing. Fe2AlTi exhibits a compression-tension asymmetry with respect to these strains and, for example, the strain epsilon=-0.08 destabilizes the spin-polarized state, leaving the non-magnetic state as the only stable one.

   Impurity-Controlled Helium Environments
SO OXIDATION OF METALS
AB The high temperature oxidation behavior of alloy 617 and Haynes 230 have been investigated for VHTR intermediate heat exchanger applications. Oxidation tests were carried out for up to 500 h at 900 A degrees C and 1000 A degrees C in impure helium environments containing H-2, H2O, CO, CO2, and CH4. The oxidation kinetics of the alloys followed a parabolic rate law in all cases. In the impure helium environments with very low oxygen, the external oxides of alloy 617 were composed of a Cr2O3 layer, TiO2 ridges on the grain boundaries, and isolated MnCr2O4 grains on top of the Cr2O3 layer. On the other hand, those of Haynes 230 consisted of a Cr2O3 inner layer and a protective MnCr2O4 outer layer, which increased the oxidation resistance. The effect of small amounts of CH4 and H-2 on the oxidation kinetics of the alloys was insignificant. Irregular oxide morphology, such as cellular Cr2O3 oxides for alloy 617 and MnCr2O4 platelets for Haynes 230, was formed in the impure helium environment at 900 A degrees C. For Haynes 230, along with platelets, whiskers were frequently found at the tip of the MnCr2O4 oxide crystals.

AB The most commonly used structural materials for blades and other high temperature components of gas turbines are nickel base superalloys. A TBC protection coating system consists of a top coat of yttria partially stabilized zirconia and an underlying bond coat, usually MCrAlY (where M stands for Ni, Co or a combination of both). MCrAlYs are normally deposited by the thermal spray processes: air plasma spray (APS), vacuum plasma spray (VPS/LPPS) or high velocity oxygen fuel (HVOF). The adhesion between the bond coat and the substrate, and therefore of the whole thermal barrier system, strongly depends upon the surface roughness. A high level of roughness generally denotes better adhesion, especially with the HVOF thermal spray process where it is a necessity. Generally the roughness is reached by means of grit blasting with an abrasive media; this results in a certain level of surface contamination due to the entrapment of abrasive particles. The aim of this work was to set up a new surface preparation process in order to obtain a completely clean surface with a suitable roughness, which can be coated afterwards with HVOF or VPS/LPPS thermal spray technology. The tests carried out by this process on turbine blades, coated with a HVOF system, led to obtaining a coating/base material interface without any contamination caused by the surface preparation.

AB The fusion zone and heat affected zone (HAZ) microstructures of electron beam welded superalloy 718PLUS (TM) (718 Plus) that has been newly developed by ATI ALLVAC were examined. The microsegregation pattern during solidification of the fusion zone indicated that while Fe, Co, W, and Cr segregated to the core of the gamma dendrites, Nb, Ti, and Al were extensively rejected into the interdendritic liquid. Electron diffraction and X-ray microanalysis using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of the fusion zone showed that the major secondary phases that formed from the interdendritic liquid were gamma/MC type carbide eutectic and gamma/Laves eutectic constituents. HAZ microstructure showed partially melted zone immediately adjacent to the fusion zone and intergranular microfissuring associated with resolidified products which suggested that HAZ cracking in this alloy occurred by liquation cracking. Microstructural examination of the HAZ using analytical scanning electron microscope showed resolidified gamma/Laves eutectic on the cracked and backfilled grain boundaries. Fine resolidified MC type carbide particles were also observed in the HAZ. Causes of grain boundary liquation were identified and the solidification of intergranular liquid in the HAZ was discussed.

TI Effects of Vanadium Intergranular Segregation at FCC/L1(2) Interfaces in
   Ni-Al-V Alloys
SO JOURNAL OF PHASE EQUILIBRIA AND DIFFUSION
AB A study of the interfacial properties of Ni-Al-V alloys is presented further, together with the interatomic potentials of the Ni-Al-V ternary phase system given in this paper, with the application of the Phase-field method and atomistic simulations, based on the second nearest-neighbor modified embedded-atom method (2NN MEAM) potential formalism. It is discovered that the alloy elements have different preferences of segregation or depletion at the (100) FCC/L1(2) interface (the gamma-FCC-Ni(Al, V) and the L1(2)-Ni-3(Al, V)) of diffusion phases. Nickel atoms segregate first and then deplete, Vanadium atoms segregate while aluminum atoms deplete at the (100) FCC/L1(2) interfaces forming new diffusion phases. Both, vanadium segregation and aluminum depletion affect the alloy's interfacial properties which in turn, will lower the interfacial energy and increase the work of separation. The results of the Phase-field method coincide with the results of the atomistic computation based on the 2NN MEAM method. Furthermore, the applicability of the atomistic approach to an elaborate alloy design of advanced Ni-based superalloys through the investigation of the effect of alloying elements at the interfacial properties is discussed.

TI HRTEM analysis of the high-temperature phases of the newly developed
   high-temperature Ni-base superalloy VDM 780 Premium
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB VDM 780 Premium is a recently developed Ni-based superalloy designed for working at high service temperatures (above 650 degrees C) while keeping the good workability of alloy 718. VDM 780 Premium is based on the austenitic matrix (gamma phase) strengthened by intermetallic Ni3Al-like precipitates (gamma' phase, fcc L1(2) structure). Other co-precipitates may be formed in function of the applied heat treatment, such as Ni3Nb-based (delta phase, orthorhombic DOa structure) or Ni3Ti-based (eta phase, hexagonal DO24 structure) precipitates. The amount as well as the size and morphology of the different precipitates depend on the heat treatments performed on the alloy, playing an important role in improving the creep properties or the behavior during forging and recrystallization. This work contains a complex study using various techniques of analytical electron microscopy and synchrotron diffraction intended to clarify the structure of the high-temperature phase formed in the newly developed VDM 780 Premium alloy. The atomic structure of the high-temperature plate-like precipitates formed in VDM 780 Premium after two different thermal treatments has been investigated in relation with the surrounding matrix lattice, proving the stacked delta/eta structure of the precipitates.

AB With the goal of investigating the reported detrimental effect of water vapor on thermal barrier coating (TBC) performance, furnace cycle experiments were conducted in dry O-2 and air with 10 and 50% water vapor at 1100 degrees C. The TBC systems evaluated were air plasma-sprayed (APS), yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) top coatings with high velocity oxy fuel (HVOF)-deposited NiCoCrAlY or NiCoCrAlYHfSi bond coating. Average TBC lifetime was reduced by 30% in air with 10% water vapor compared to cycling in dry O-2, using 1 h cycle durations. Superalloy substrates with Y and La additions also were investigated but showed no statistical change in the average TBC lifetime compared to the base CMSX4 superalloy. In all cases, the bond coating with Hf and Si additions increased YSZ lifetime by 20% or more. Experiments that increased water vapor to 50% showed no further decrease in TBC lifetime. Increasing the cycle frequency to 100 h resulted in a large increase in TBC lifetime, especially for the NiCoCrAlYHfSi bond coatings. Co-doping the NiCoCrAl bond coat with Y and Hf was beneficial to TBC lifetime, but did not mitigate the detrimental impact of water vapor. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Modern aero engine turbine blades made of nickel-based superalloys are covered by thermal barrier coatings (TBC) for thermal and oxidation protection. A new generation of TBCs consist of a bond coat (thin layer of MCrAlY, where M may be Ni, Co, Fe) followed by a ceramic top coat of RE2Zr2O7 (RE - rare earth element). In this paper we present the possibility of the electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) method for characterisation of the microstructure and crystallographic orientation of a new TBC consisting of a Gd2Zr2O7 top coat and a NiFeCrAlY bond coat after long thermal exposure (1100 degrees C, 500 h). During thermal exposure, a thermally grown oxide (TGO) layer forms at the bond coat/top coat interface. The TGO is mainly composed of Al2O3. But, there is a possible reaction between Gd2Zr2O7 and Al2O3, leading to Gd-Al-O phases. Phase composition plays an important role in controlling the stress evolution, TGO deformation and crack propagation. Application of SEM-EDS-EBSD techniques allows direct characterisation of the chemical composition, phase composition and crystallographic orientation in the ceramic top coat and TGO layers. This paper presents the possibilities of using the EBSD method for phase identification (Gd2Zr2O7, spinel Ni(Al,Cr)(2)O-4, GdAlO3 and other phases) and orientation analysis of grains in the TGO layer.

TI Precipitation phases in the nickel-based superalloy DZ 125 with
   YSZ/CoCrAlY thermal barrier coating
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Interdiffusion behavior of the thermal barrier coating (TBC) with the CoCrAlY bond coat (BC) and directionally solidified Ni-based superalloy DZ 125 was investigated. Severe inward-diffusion of Al, Co and Cr from the BC to the superalloy and outward diffusion of Ni and refractory elements such as W from the superalloy occur during annealing at 1050 degrees C in air. After 100 h annealing, a similar to 30 mu m thick inter-diffusion zone (IDZ) forms between the BC and superalloy, and a similar to 35 mu m thick secondary reaction zone (SRZ) forms beneath the IDZ. The IDZ mainly consists of beta phase and gamma matrix. Besides, small amount of Ta and Hf containing carbides are also observed in the IDZ. Needle and fine granular topologically close-packed (TCP) phases, characterized as rhombohedral mu phases, are abundant in the SRZ. The formation of SRZ is mainly due to the precipitation of refractory elements such as W and Mo from the gamma matrix and beta phase. The formation mechanism of SRZ and mu-TCP phase is discussed.

AB Aeronautic gas turbine blades, vanes and combustion chambers are protected against high temperature oxidation and corrosion by single or multilayered coatings. These include environmental coatings, generally based on Pt-modified Ni aluminides or MCrAlY overlays (where M = Ni and/or Co), thermal barrier coating (TBC) systems including a ceramic thermally insulating layer, and abradable seals. The present work shows the ability of the Spark Plasma Sintering technique to rapidly develop new coatings compositions and microstructures. This technique allows combining powders and metallic foils on a superalloy substrate in order to obtain multilayered coatings in a single short production step. Fabrication of MCrAlY overlays with local Pt and/or Al enrichments is shown, as well as fabrication of coatings made of zeta-PtAl2, epsilon-PtAl, alpha-AlNiPt2, martensitic and beta-(Ni,Pt)Al or Pt-rich gamma/gamma' phases, including their doping with reactive elements. The fabrication of a complete TBC system with a porous and adherent Yttria Stabilized Zirconia (YSZ) layer on a bond-coating is also demonstrated, as well as the fabrication of a CoNiCrAlY-based cermet coating for abradable seal application. Difficulties of fabrication are reviewed, such as Y segregation, risks of carburization, local over-heating, or difficulty to coat complex shaped parts. Solutions are given to overcome these difficulties.

TI Influence of surface roughness on the oxidation behavior of a
   Ni-4.0Cr-5.7Al single crystal superalloy
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB The high-temperature oxidation dynamics and mechanisms of a Ni-based single crystal superalloy with four kinds of surface roughnesses were investigated by virtue of XRD, OM, SEM and EDS at 1000 degrees C. In the initial oxidation stage, outer (Ni, Co)O was mainly produced on the surfaces of the samples with Ra = 90 nm and 19 nm. Correspondingly, outer Cr2O3 and transient theta-Al2O3 were mainly formed on the surfaces with Ra = 509 nm and 182 nm. After 180 min oxidation, the values of instantaneous parabolic mass gain coefficients (k(p)) of the samples with all surface roughnesses were gradually consistent with the data of the growth parabolic coefficient of alpha-Al2O3. The oxidation mechanisms of Ni-based superalloy with different surface roughnesses were discussed by a model. The external diffusion flux of Al (D-Al) increases with the increases of surface roughness. Thus, the required Al concentration decreases with the increases of surface roughness when the selective oxidation of Al occurrs to form a protective single alpha-Al2O3 film. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

TI Surface engineering analysis of detonation-gun sprayed Cr3C2-NiCr
   coating under high-temperature oxidation and oxidation-erosion
   environments
SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB Detonation-gun (D-gun) spray technology is a novel coating deposition process which is capable of achieving very high gas and particle velocities approaching 4-5 times the speed of sound. This process provides the possibility of producing high hardness coatings with strong adherence. In the present study, this technique has been used to deposit Cr3C2-NiCr coating on T22 boiler steel. Investigations on the behaviour of this coating subjected to high-temperature oxidation in air and oxidation-erosion in actual boiler environment at 700 +/- 10 degrees C under cyclic conditions have been carried out. The weight change technique was used to establish the kinetics of oxidation. X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission-scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive spectroscopy (FE-SEM/EDS) and EDS elemental mapping techniques were used to analyse the oxidation/oxidation-erosion products. The uncoated boiler steel suffered from a catastrophic degradation in the form of intense spalling of the scale in both the environments. The Cr3C2-NiCr coating showed good adherence to the boiler steel during the exposures with no tendency for spallation of its oxide scale. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Chromia-Assisted Decarburization of W-Rich Ni-Based Alloys in Impure
   Helium at 1273 K (1000 degrees C)
SO METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND
   MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB The microstructure and surface stability of two experimental W-rich Ni-based alloys have been studied at 1273 K (1000 A degrees C) in an impure-He environment containing only CO and CO2 as impurities. The alloy Ni-2.3Al-12Cr-12W contained 0.08 wt pct carbon in solution, whereas the second alloy Ni-2.3Al-3Mo-12Cr-12Co-12W contained M6C carbides at the same carbon level. Both alloys, which were preoxidized with similar to 2.3 mu m Cr2O3 layer, were decarburized completely within 50 hours of exposure to the helium gas mixture at 1273 K (1000 A degrees C) via the following chromia-assisted decarburization reaction: Cr2O3 (s) + 3C(alloy) (s) -> 2Cr (s) + 3CO (g). Microstructural observations, bulk carbon analysis, and microprobe measurements confirmed that the carbon in solid solution reacted with the surface chromium oxide resulting in the simultaneous loss of chromia and carbon. The Cr produced by the decomposition of the Cr2O3 diffused back into the alloy, whereas CO gas was released and detected by a gas chromatograph. Once the alloy carbon content was reduced to negligible levels, subsequent exposure led to the uninterrupted growth of Cr2O3 layer in both alloys. In the preoxidized alloys, chromia-assisted decarburization rates were slower for an alloy containing carbides compared with the alloy with carbon in solid solution only. The formation of Cr2O3 is shown to be the rate-limiting step in the chromia-assisted decarburization reaction. Exposure of as-fabricated alloys to the impure-He environment led to the formation of a thin layer of Al2O3 (< 1 mu m) between the substrate and surface Cr2O3 oxide that inhibited this decarburization process by acting as a diffusion barrier.

TI STUDY ON THE PRECIPITATION AND DISSOLUTION OF sigma PHASE IN A HOT
   CORROSION RESISTANCE CAST NICKLE BASE SUPERALLOY
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB The experimental alloy is designed and employed in high-performance industrial gas turbines as low-pressure turbine blades, working in temperature range of 750 similar to 900 degrees C. The alloy contains high levels of refractory elements in order to increase the high-temperature mechanical properties. However, this can make the alloy prone to the formation of sigma phase during service, which could deteriorate the properties further if the fraction of sigma phase exceeds the safety allowances. In this study, the formation of sigma phase during long-term thermal exposure, dissolution of the sigma phase during rejuvenation process and their influence on stress-rupture properties of a hot-corrosion resistant nickel base superalloy have been investigated. During long-term thermal exposure at 800 similar to 900 degrees C for up to 1 x 10(4) h, the sigma phase formation is mainly in dendrite cores with a few at interdendritic regions. As the aging temperature increases, the precipitation rate of sigma phase increases and the incubation time for nucleation of sigma phase decreases. From the kinetic analysis, the sigma phase form firstly in the vicinity or on the M23C6 in dendrite cores with the strong segregation of W, Cr and Co. The calculated activation energies of a formation show that the early stage is related to Co and Cr diffusions and the steady stage is related to Mo diffusion. During solid solution process at 1000 similar to 1170 degrees C the sigma phase precipitated during long-term thermal exposure dissolves to gamma matrix. As the solid solution temperature is higher, the dissolution of a phase becomes faster. Moreover, the sigma phase does not embrittle the alloy. The reheat treatment of the alloy leads to the dissolution of precipitated sigma phase and further prolongs the stress-rupture life efficiently.

TI A Comparative Study on Zn and Zn-Y Coatings on 42CrMo Steel by Pack

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTROCHEMICAL SCIENCE
AB Zn and Zn-Y coatings on 42CrMo steel were prepared by pack cementation process at 360 degrees C, 370 degrees C, 380 degrees C, 390 degrees C and 400 degrees C for 4 h, respectively. The purpose of this work was to comparatively study the differences on the microstructure and corrosion behavior between the two coatings. The relationship between the coating thickness and the temperature followed the linear rule. The Zn coating was continuous and had a single-layer structure. The Zn-Y coating exhibited a similar structure to the Zn-Fe coating. The Zn-Fe coating was a layer of Fe-Zn intermetallic compounds with increasing Fe3Zn10 concentration. YZn5 was formed with the addition of Y. The effect of Y addition on the microstructure and corrosion behavior of the Zn coating was discussed. The thickness of the Zn-Y coating was thicker than that of the Zn coating. The activation energy for the formation of the coating decreased with the addition of Y. The concentration of Fe3Zn10 phase in the Zn-Y coating was slightly higher than that in the Zn coating, which suggested that the addition of Y promoted the formation of the Fe3Zn10 phase. The immersion test showed that the addition of Y could improve the ability of the coating to resist the penetration of Cl- and O-2.

TI A Comprehensive Review of Corrosion Resistance of Thermally-Sprayed and
   Thermally-Diffused Protective Coatings on Steel Structures
SO JOURNAL OF THERMAL SPRAY TECHNOLOGY
AB Protective coatings are widely utilized to promote corrosion resistance of the surfaces of steel components that are used in various industrial applications. Different surface engineering methods such as thermal spraying and thermal diffusion techniques can be used to fabricate these protective coatings. Thermal spraying processes have received significant attention due to their ability to deposit a variety of materials. Several metals such as zinc-, aluminum-, nickel, and chromium-based materials and their alloys can be deposited using thermal spraying processes to enhance the corrosion resistance and prolong the service life of steel components. On the other hand, technologies based on thermal diffusion techniques are emerging due to their unique deposition features, which alleviates the issues of cracking and delamination typical of thermal-sprayed coatings, as well as their ability to protect inaccessible and complex components such as the inner surface of long tubing and pipelines. This work is a comprehensive review on short and long-term corrosion resistance of the most effective and commonly-used coatings deposited by a variety of surface engineering techniques to protect steel structures. Moreover, the effect of the spraying process, the addition of alloying elements on the corrosion resistance of these coatings has also been reviewed in this study.

TI Selection and evaluation of heat-resistant alloys for SOFC interconnect
   applications
SO JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Over the past several years, advances in the design and fabrication of planar solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) have led to a steady reduction in the temperatures necessary for their operation. Consequently, it appears more realistic now to use low cost heat-resistant alloys for interconnect components in the SOFC stack. However, no specific criteria or inclusive study are available as a reference to help select and evaluate suitable candidates from the hundreds of available heat-resistant alloy compositions, which overall demonstrate oxidation resistance at high temperatures. In this work, composition criteria have been proposed for the preselection of heat-resistant compositions, such as Ni-, Fe-, and Co-based superalloys, Cr-based alloys, and stainless steels. The proposed criteria have been employed to establish a database of heat-resistant alloys at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, where a systematic approach has been initiated to evaluate and modify and/or develop alloys for SOFC interconnect applications. The preselected compositions are further evaluated by referring in-house studies and reference to published data. It appears that it would be difficult for traditional alloys to fully satisfy the materials requirements for long-term operation at temperatures higher than 700degreesC. However, the applicability can be improved via surface/bulk modification and by the implementation of novel stack designs. (C) 2003 The Electrochemical Society.

TI Zn-Fe and Zn-Fe-Y Cementation Coatings for Enhancing Corrosion

Zn-Fe coatings on steel 45 were prepared at different temperatures (380 degrees C, 390 degrees C, 400 degrees C and 410 degrees C) by pack cementation process. The microstructure, formation mechanism and corrosion behavior of the Zn-Fe coatings were investigated. The Zn-Fe coating possessed a two-layered structure consisting of a thin diffusion layer and a thick outer layer. The coating thickness increased with the increase of the temperature. Zn-Fe-Y coating on steel 45 was prepared by the pack cementation process at 390 degrees C. The effect of Y addition on the microstructure and corrosion behavior of the Zn-Fe coating was studied. The structure of the Zn-Fe-Y coating was similar to that of the Zn-Fe coating. The coating thickness increased with the addition of Y. The activation energies for the formation of the Zn-Fe and the Zn-Fe-Y coatings were 82.31 kJ/ mol and 81.12 kJ/ mol, respectively. The corrosion resistance was measured by the immersion test and polarization test. The results showed that the corrosion resistance of the Zn- Fe coating firstly increased and then decreased with the increase of temperature. The Zn-Fe-Y coating had better corrosion resistance than the Zn-Fe coating.

TI Microstructure prediction of TMW-4M3 during heat treatment
SO COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB The calculation model on the basis of multi-phase-field model, coupled with the calculation of phase diagram (CALPHAD) approach and classical nucleation theory (CNT) model, was studied for the precipitation behavior of gamma' precipitates in Ni-Co base superalloy TMW-4M3 ("TMW" is a trademark of National Institute for Materials Science registered in Japan) during the heat treatment process. This alloy is precipitation strengthened by gamma', and thus the control of size and distribution of gamma' precipitates is very important for practical applications. Precipitation behavior of gamma' in TMW-4M3 is strongly influenced by heat treatment conditions. Therefore, numerical simulation is useful for finding the most appropriate manufacturing condition prior to experimental trial and error approach. Firstly, we investigated the gamma' solvus temperature and improved several thermodynamic parameters of the conventional database to obtain reasonable phase boundaries between gamma/eta (Ni3Ti) and gamma/gamma'. Based on the new thermodynamic description, the nucleation rates related to temperature histories were calculated by using the CNT with composition balance equation under subsolvus solution treatment. Finally, the multi-phase-field method coupled with the CALPHAD approach and CNT model was applied to the microstructure evolution of intragranular secondary gamma' particles. The experimental and simulated microstructures show good agreement with each other. This method might be useful for microstructure evolution prediction of gamma/gamma' dual phase during the heat-treatment. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI On microstructure and mechanical performance of AlCoCrFeMo0.5Nix
   high-entropy alloys
SO INTERMETALLICS
AB A high-entropy alloy system, AlCoCrFeMo0.5Nix, was designed based on the AlCoCrCuFeNi alloy, by replacing Cu with Mo in order to improve strength and thermal stability. Ni content was monitored to see its effect on microstructure and properties. The microstructure of AlCoCrFeMo0.5Nix alloys consists of B2, FCC, and sigma phase which are all multi-element solid solutions. As nickel content increases, the constituent phases change from B2 + sigma phases at x = 0 to B2 + FCC + sigma phases at x = 2.0, reflecting Ni is an FCC stabilizer. The room temperature hardness of the present alloy system decreases from Hv 904 at x = 0 to Hv 404 at x = 2.0. AlCoCrFeMo0.5Nix alloys with x = 0, 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 exhibit higher hot hardness level than that of Ni-based superalloys, In 718 and In 718 H. up to 1273 K. Furthermore, they possess the less negative value of softening coefficient (B-II) at high-temperature regime as compared with those of In 718, In 718 H, and T-800. This superiority can be explained with the slow diffusion rate of vacancies in the multi-element matrix. The present alloy system has great potential in high-temperature applications.

TI Microstructural evolution and compression property of a novel gamma
   '-strengthened directionally solidified CoNi-base superalloy
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB The microstructural evolution and compression property of a novel gamma'-strengthened CoNi-base superalloy have been investigated. The directionally solidified CoNi-base superalloy possesses a lower density of 9.03 g/cm(3) and a higher gamma' solvus temperature of 1166 degrees C, compared with those of the Co-Al-W-base superalloys with high level of W element. After aging at 900-1100 degrees C, the alloy displays stable gamma/gamma' two-phase microstructure with high volume fraction of the gamma' phase, and without detrimental topologically close-packed (TCP) phase. The CoNi-base superalloy shows good compression property. In the process of compression, the alloy exhibits positive temperature dependence of the 0.2% flow stress above 600 degrees C. With increasing temperature, the alloy displays a maximum of 0.2% flow stress of 607 MPa at 850 degrees C. The major deformation mechanisms of the CoNi-base alloy are pairs of a/2 < 110 > -type dislocations shearing gamma' precipitates from room temperature to 850 degrees C and unpaired dislocations bypassing the gamma' precipitates above the peak temperature of 850 degrees C. In this alloy, high content of Ni improves the gamma' solvus temperature and microstructural stability, which leads to a good compression property at high temperatures.

TI INCONEL (R) alloy 783: An oxidation-resistant, low expansion superalloy
   for gas turbine applications
SO JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING FOR GAS TURBINES AND POWER-TRANSACTIONS OF THE
   ASME
CT 41st International Gas Turbine and Aeroengine Congress and Exhibition
CY JUN 10-13, 1996
CL BIRMINGHAM, ENGLAND
AB INCONEL(R) alloy 783 is art oxidation-resistant low coefficient of thermal expansion (low CTE) superalloy developed for gas turbine applications. Turbine efficiency can be increased through the use of low-CTE shrouds and case components that maintain tight blade tip clearances at different turbine operating temperatures. To achieve low CTE, alloys based on Ni-Fe-Co compositions require Cr content be maintained at low levels. Added Cr lowers the Curie temperature and thereby increases thermal expansion rate over a wider temperature range. The necessary lack of Cr minimizes resistance to both general oxidation and stress-accelerated grain boundary oxygen enhanced cracking (SAGBO). Increased amounts of Al in alloys strengthened by y' alone also promotes SAGBO. Alloy 783 is the culmination in the development of an alloy system with very high aluminum content that, in addition to forming y', causes beta aluminide phase precipitation in the austenitic matrix. It was discovered that this type of structure can be processed to resist both SAGBO and general oxidation, while providing low thermal expansion and useful mechanical properties up to 700 degrees C. The high Al content also reduces density to 5 percent below that of superalloys such as INCONEL alloy 718. Key aspects of the alloy development are presented, including the assessment of SAGBO resistance by evaluating elevated temperature crack growth in air The alloy, now commercially available, has been successfully fabricated and welded into gas turbine engine components.

TI Degradation behaviour and microstructural characterisation of
   HVOF-sprayed Cr3C2-NiCr cermet coatings in molten salt environment
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MATERIALS & PRODUCT TECHNOLOGY
AB The present work investigated the cyclic high temperature degradation behaviour of high velocity oxy-fuel (HVOF) sprayed Cr3C2-NiCr coating deposited on 310S stainless steel (310S). The coated as well as uncoated specimens were exposed to molten salt (Na2SO4-60%V2O5) environment at 700 degrees C under cyclic conditions. The kinetics of hot corrosion was established using thermogravimetric technique. The corrosion products were characterised using the techniques such as X-ray diffraction, FE-SEM/EDAX and X-ray mapping for elucidating the corrosion mechanisms. The Cr3C2-25%NiCr coating was found to be successful in maintaining its continuous contact with the alloy substrate during cyclic degradation under simulated laboratory condition. HVOF sprayed Cr3C2-25% NiCr coating on 310S alloy substrate is found to be very effective in reducing the corrosion rate in the aggressive environment at 700 degrees C as observed from the present work. The oxide scales for Cr3C2-25% NiCr coated specimen were found to be intact and spallation-free. The parabolic rate constant of the coated specimen was lower than that of the bare specimen. The better hot corrosion resistance imparted by Cr3C2-NiCr coatings may be attributed to the formation of oxides of chromium, nickel and spinel of nickel and chromium.

TI High temperature environmental resistant Mo-Si-B based coatings
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REFRACTORY METALS & HARD MATERIALS
AB For high temperature applications nickel base superalloys with aluminide coatings are reaching the service limit. Alternate materials such as refractory metal silicide alloys can extend high temperature capability, but the silica surfaces require coatings for enhanced environmental resistance. We present a review of an effective strategy to achieve the environmental resistance through the use of an integrated Mo-Si-B based coating that is applied by a co-deposition of Si and B by pack cementation. During oxidation of the (Si + B)-pack alloys, the initial MoSi2 outer layer is consumed by formation of the Mo5Si3 (T-1) phase and the development of the underlying Mo5SiB2, T-2 borosilicide and/or MoB boride phase layer. The T-1 phase with B has excellent oxidation resistance and the loss of Si to the substrate is blocked by the underlying diffusion barrier (T-2). Any damage to the outer T-1 layer can be recovered from the T-2 MoB layer to yield a self-healing characteristic. The Mo-Si-B based coating on Mo based alloys exhibits robust performance up to at least 1700 degrees C not only to high temperature oxidation, but also to water vapor and corrosive deposit attack. Some of the applications are discussed for use of the coating strategy on ceramic materials.

TI Influence of process parameter variation during thermo-mechanical
   processing of an intermetallic beta-stabilized gamma-TiAl based alloy
SO MATERIALS CHARACTERIZATION
AB The effort of weight reduction in modern aircraft engines, while improving performance and efficiency, demands novel light-weight high temperature materials to replace heavy nickel-based superalloys for low pressure turbine blades. Low density, high specific stiffness, elevated-temperature strength retention as well as good environmental resistance make gamma-TiAl based alloys a promising substitute. The requirement for high and balanced mechanical properties of low pressure turbine blades in next generation aircraft engines favors a hot working strategy. Thermo-mechanical processing, however, of gamma-TiAl based alloys is a challenging task due to a narrow "processing window". Isothermal forging, state-of-the-art process for this material class, leads to high tooling and forging costs. With this in mind, Bohler Schmiedetechnik GmbH & Co KG has developed a "near conventional" thermo-mechanical processing technology. A die temperature about 400 degrees C to 800 degrees C below billet temperature and processing under standard atmosphere as well as usage of a conventional hydraulic press with high ram speed result in a more economical process. Subsequent heat treatment strategies can be used to tailor microstructure and, therefore, mechanical properties according to customer requirements.
   This paper summarizes industrial forging trials as well as mechanical testing and shows the effect of process variations on the final components' properties. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Large-scale simulation of dendrite growth in directional solidification
   castings
SO PHYSICA STATUS SOLIDI B-BASIC SOLID STATE PHYSICS
AB In this study, the growth and distribution of directional solidification (DS) dendrites in entire cross-sections of DS superalloy castings are simulated based on a modified shape function dendritic (MSFD) model coupled with the cellular automaton-finite difference (CA-FD) method. The macro-thermal transfer and columnar grain growth are calculated using CA-FD with a macro time-step, and then, the original and boundary conditions for the dendrite-growth simulation are determined via the interpolation of the macro temperature and the projection of the 3D preferential grain orientation using a matrix, M. The dendrite growth calculation cyclically proceeds based on the MSFD model. It is used to predict the growth of hundreds of dendrites throughout the cross-section of a DS casting by considering the macro-solidification parameters. The MSFD model is further applied to predict the competitive growth of DS dendrites and their distribution in the cross-sections of a spiral selector and a fake single crystal turbine blade. The results of the simulation correlate with the results of the DS experiment. Hence, the modified model coupled with the macro-simulation models can be used to predict the morphology and distribution of DS dendrites with respect to large-scale castings produced by the DS process.

TI Effect of modification by Pt and manufacturing processes on the
   microstructure of two NiCoCrAlYTa bond coatings intended for thermal
   barrier system applications
SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB Few studies have already shown that Pt influences the diffusion of aluminium and therefore the microstructure of beta-NiAl or gamma-Ni/gamma'-Ni(3)Al materials. Besides, several works have revealed that the addition of Pt to MCrAlY (M = Ni and/or Co) improves the oxidation/corrosion behavior of the material. Nevertheless, very few data have been published on the microstructure of such modified MCrAlYs. Then, the present work deals with the addition of Pt to two NiCoCrAlYTa coatings that differ by their manufacturing process. Characterization is carried out in order to understand the influence of Pt diffusion but also the effect of the manufacturing process on the final microstructure. The collected data from XRD, SEM. EDS and TEM analyses reveal that an Al uphill diffusion occurs during heat treatment due to the presence of the Pt layer. The Al diffusion from the NiCoCrAlYTa bulk to the Pt-rich surface is so extensive that no more beta-phase remains within the core of the coating. Pt may also dissolve TaC, precipitates largely present in the non-modified NiCoCrAlYTa coatings. In addition to Pt, the microstructure of the NiCoCrAlYTa prior to Pt deposition and heat treatment, dependent on the NiCoCrAlYTa manufacturing process, greatly influences the final microstructure.

TI Effects of long-term thermal exposure on the microstructure and
   properties of a cast Ni-base superalloy
SO METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND
   MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Microstructural stability and microstructure-property relationship during long-term thermal exposure in K452 alloy (a new Ni-base cast superalloy with similar to 21 pct Cr, 11 pct Co, 3.5 pct W, 2.5 pct Al, 3.5 pct Ti, and others) are investigated. It is found that exposure temperature and time have significant effects on the microstructure and properties of the alloy. During exposure, the microstructure is degraded by gamma' coarsening, MC carbide (M mainly represents Ti. W, and Nb) degeneration, precipitation and evolution of grain interior (GI) M23C6 carbide, evolution of grain boundary (GB) microstructure, and precipitation of eta phase. Among them, the gamma' coarsening is the leading reason for the decrease of strength of the alloy. The GI M23C6 and the eta phase have negligible influence on the properties due to their relatively small populations. Blocky, closely spaced GB M23C6 particles engulfed in gamma' increase the stress-rupture life, whereas the formation of a continuous GB M23C6 chain has an opposite effect. A life peak occurs when the M23C6/gamma' structure at the GBs is in an optimal form. The degenerated MC is the preferred initiation site of microcracks. Its presence at the GBs promotes the onset of intergranular fracture; and leads to the decrease in mechanical properties.

TI The development of new bond coat compositions for thermal barrier
   coating systems operating under industrial gas turbine conditions
SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB Environmental and economic issues are driving the development of increasingly efficient gas turbines. An important step in achieving this is to engineer components which can operate with longer lifetimes and at higher metal temperatures. Inlet temperatures for gas turbines now exceed the melting temperatures of nickel-based superalloys (i.e. 1300-1350 degrees C). The use of advanced air cooling systems coupled with thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) reduces the temperature of the underlying superalloy substrate. The bond coating, an important part of the TBC system, oxidizes to form a slow growing protective oxide layer, while also providing adhesion between the ceramic topcoat and the substrate. NiCoCrAlY overlay coatings are some of the most commonly used bond coatings for industrial gas turbines and extensive research has been undertaken over many years to find the best bond coating composition.
   This paper reports upon the production of new, model bond coatings with a wide range of different compositions. The focus is on their oxidation behavior at a temperature typically experienced by bond coatings on industrial turbine blades (950 degrees C). A physical vapor deposition technique, magnetron sputtering, has been used to deposit a range of Ni-Co-Cr-Al coatings onto 10 mm diameter sapphire substrates. This was achieved through co-sputtering two targets: a Ni-10%Cr, Ni-20%Cr, Ni-50%Cr, Ni-20%Co-40%Cr or Ni-40%Co-20%Cr target and a pure Al target. About a hundred samples with varying compositions were produced by this method. The coatings were then oxidized in air for 500 h at 950 degrees C.
   All samples were assessed by measuring the change in coating thickness, using pre- and post-exposure metrology only, and also the change in specimen weight. This approach has shown that magnetron sputtering successfully deposited 20 to 30 mu m thick coatings and allowed the calculation of oxide growth rates. Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis was used to characterize the exact composition of each sample. Additionally, Xray diffraction (XRD) has been used to identify the major oxides formed during exposure. The selective growth of protective Cr2O3 or Al2O3 or other less protective mixed oxides (depending on the initial coating composition) was observed. This influenced the oxide scale growth rate, indicating which coatings produced more protective oxides and allowing future optimization of the bond coating composition, for service within the turbine section of industrial gas turbines to be planned.

TI Microstructural characteristics and thermophysical properties of spark
   plasma sintered Inconel 738LC
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY
AB Nickel-based superalloys are used for turbine component parts in the power industry, aircraft engines, and in the marine sector. One such alloy that is available for these purposes is Inconel 738LC (IN738LC) nickel-based superalloy. Therefore, it is pertinent to have good structural and thermal stabilities for high-temperature applications, since these characteristics are important for its performance. In this study, spark plasma sintering technology was used to fabricate IN738LC nickel-based superalloy by using sintering temperature in the range of between 900 and 1200 degrees C. The fabricated products were characterized by using the scanning electron microscope and X-ray diffraction. There was the formation of the gamma '(Ni-3(Ti, Al)) intermetallic phase in the microstructure, which contributed to the material (Inconel 738LC) property. The solid solution elements present are chromium, cobalt, tungsten, and tantalum; these equally contribute to the structural stability of IN738LC. The density, hardness, and the predicted yield strength increased with increasing sintering temperature, while the porosity decreased with increasing sintering temperature. The thermal conductivity, which is an important thermophysical property of IN738LC, enables the evaluation of the usefulness and service life of IN738LC superalloy at high-temperature applications, was also examined. The thermal conductivity was measured by using a laser flash method in the temperature range of 100-600 degrees C. For the sintered alloy, the thermal conductivity was determined as a function of the thermal diffusivity, specific heat capacity, and density. Analysis showed inflection pattern with increase in temperature on the sample fabricated at 900, 1000, and 1100 degrees C, ; a monotonic increase with increase in temperature was observed on the sample fabricated at 1200 degrees C, ; the inflections are associated with the gamma ' precipitates dissolution and redistribution.

TI Effect of microstructure on early oxidation of MCrAlY coatings
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB Two MCrAlY coatings with the same nominal composition, but different microstructures are deposited onto Hastelloy (R) X superalloy substrates by low-pressure plasma spraying (LPPS) and high velocity oxygen fuel (HVOF) spraying, respectively. The early oxidation behaviour of the coatings at 1150 degrees C is studied. For the LPPS coating with relative coarse grains, the gamma and beta-phase show different oxidation behaviours: the oxide on the gamma-phase shows a multi-layer structure, consisting of outer (Ni,Co) (Cr,Al)(2)O-4, intermediate (Cr,Al)(2)O-3 and inner alpha-Al2O3; the oxidation of the beta-phase, however, is characterised by selective oxidation of aluminium and the oxide is composed of a mixture of theta and alpha-Al2O3. a For the nanocrystalline HVOF coating, it does not show site-specific oxidation and the oxidation is characterised by formation of an exclusive alpha-Al2O3 scale over the surface. The microstructure-dependent oxidation is quantitatively described from the perspective of oxidation kinetics, with contribution from both lattice and grain boundary diffusion taken into consideration. A critical grain size of the gamma-phase, below which formation of an exclusive Al2O3 scale can be achieved, is predicted and verified. The study gives new insights into oxidation of MCrAlY coatings.

SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB A new Ni-based superalloy with high-Cr content was designed for industrial gas turbines application. The microstructural homogenization and high-temperature cyclic oxidation behavior was investigated systematically. The results showed that the optimum heat treatment condition was 1563 K (1290 degrees C)/4 h + 1573 K (1300 degrees C)/6 h, A. C. (air cooling) + 1393 K (1120 degrees C)/2 h, A. C. + 1143 K (870 degrees C)/24 h, A. C., which can completely dissolve the gamma/gamma' eutectic and the Ni-3(TiTa) phase in the interdendritic region. The cyclic oxidation results showed that a multilayer of continuous and dense oxide-rich regions formed and the kinetic curves followed a parabolic law. The mass gain at 1323 K (1050 degrees C) and 1343 K (1070 degrees C) was 4.02 mg/cm(2) and 4.23 mg/cm(2), respectively. No severe spallation of the oxide-rich region was observed. The outer layer of the oxide-rich region mainly consisted of Cr2O3, TiO2, and (Ni, Co) Cr2O4 spinels, while the layer at the substrate-oxide interface was found to be Al2O3. The results show that this new superalloy has a better cyclic oxidation resistance at 1343 K (1070 degrees C) than the commonly used IN738 and GTD-111 superalloys. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI Experimental Study on Surface Characteristics of Laser Cladding Layer
   Regulated by High-Frequency Microforging
SO JOURNAL OF THERMAL SPRAY TECHNOLOGY
AB High-frequency microforging technology is used to produce micrometer-scale plastic deformation on the surface of material out of the vibration impact of a forging punch, and the cumulative effect of its various frequencies on micrometer-scale plastic deformation can cause changes of surface microstructure and mechanical properties. This study used (1) a self-made machine to treat NiCrBSi alloy, (2) a mechanical comparator and optical microscopy (OM) to study the geometric characteristics of plastic deformation, (3) OM and scanning electric microscopy (SEM) to observe influence on surface microstructure and cracking behavior of the laser cladding layer under microforging, (4) x-ray diffractometer (XRD) to measure the surface residual stress of laser cladding layer before and after forging, and (5) microhardness tester and wearing experimental machine to study changes of microhardness, friction coefficient, and wear characteristics of laser cladding layer after microforging. The results have shown that high-frequency microforging could produce plastic deformation about 150 mu m deep on the surface of NiCrBSi alloy clad by laser. Regular dendrite and eutectic crystallization microstructure, which is a peculiar characteristic of the laser cladding layer, was broken into pieces and formed residual compression residual stress on the surface. Resistance to cracking of laser cladding layer improved greatly, microhardness and wearability increased, and the friction coefficient did not under go a noticeable change.

TI On the superior hot hardness and softening resistance of
   AlCoCrxFeMo0.5Ni high-entropy alloys
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB Effects of Cr content on microstructures and hot hardness of AlCoCrxFeMo0.5Ni high-entropy alloys (x = 0-2.0) were investigated. The cast microstructure of AlCoCrxFeMo0.5Ni consists of B2 and if phases, both being multi-element solid solutions. Increasing Cr content increases the volume fraction of if phase and causes the matrix phase of the dendrite to change from B2 phase to if phase. The alloy hardness increases from Hv 601 at x = 0 to Hv 867 at x = 2.0 as a result of increasing amount of hard sigma phase. A phase diagram for the AlCoCrxFeMo0.5Ni alloy system is constructed based on SEM, HTXRD and DTA analyses, providing useful information for understanding and designing high-entropy alloys. All the AlCoCrxFeMo0.5Ni alloys possess higher hot-hardness level than that of Ni-based superalloys, In 718 and In 718 H, from room temperature to 1273 K. Cr-1.5 and Cr-2.0 alloys exhibit a transition temperature higher than that of Co-based alloy T-800 by about 200 K and have respective hardness values. Hv 374 and Hv 450 at 1273 K, being much higher than those, around Hv 127, of In 718 and In 718 H. The mechanism of larger strengthening and softening resistance is related with B2 and sigma phases, both having multi-principal-element effect. The AlCoCrxFeMo0.5Ni alloy system has a potential in high-temperature applications. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI When a defect is a pathway to improve stability: a case study of the
   L1(2) Co3TM superlattice intrinsic stacking fault
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Effect of solutes of transition metals (TM = Cr, Fe, Hf, Mn, Mo, Nb, Ni, Pt, Rh, Ru, Re, Ta, Ti, V, W, Y and Zr) on the local phase transition between the L1(2) and D0(19) structures in superlattice intrinsic stacking fault (SISF) of Co3TM has been investigated. All the models employed herein, i.e. (1) the SISF-containing supercell, (2) the axial nearest-neighbor Ising (ANNI) model, and (3) both the L1(2)- and D0(19)-containing (L1(2) + D0(19)) supercell, yield the same result regarding the stability of SISF in L1(2)-type Co3TM. In the view of bonding charge density, the atomic and electronic basis of local D0(19) phase transition in the SISF fault layers of Co3TM are revealed. Especially, the negative SISF energy predicted by the L1(2) + D0(19) model suggests that both the SISF fault layers (i.e. the local D0(19) structure) and the L12 phase of Co3TM can be stabilized through a coupling interaction between the fault layers and the solutes, paving a pathway to stabilize Co-base superalloys via Co3TM precipitate. Moreover, the consist results of E-SISF via the ANNI model with the classical SISF-supercell method utilized in first-principles calculations supports the approach to efficiently distinguish various planar faults and predict their corresponding energies, such as SISF, superlattice intrinsic stacking fault, anti-phase boundaries, and so on.

AB Thermal Barrier Coatings (TBCs) are used as insulators on hot section components to reduce operating temperatures in aircraft engines and industrial gas turbine. The TBC system consists of two layers: the ceramic top coat traditionally Yttria Stabilized Zirconia (YSZ) with a low conductivity, and the bond coat generally MCrAlY, M=Ni and/or Cr or Co or Pd or Pt modified aluminides. In the industry, two dry-route processes used to deposit TBCs give quite different microstructures of coatings. In one hand, coatings resulted by plasma spraying (PS) present a lamellar microstruture with a low thermal conductivity in the range from 0.7 to 0.9 Wm(-1)K(-1). In the other hand, Electron Beam Physical Vapour Deposition (EBPVD) coatings with columnar microstruture coatings present the best mechanical performances but perpendicular orientation of the columns makes their thermal conductivity twice higher compared to PS coatings. The present study proposes the elaboration of zirconia coatings via the sol-gel route combined with dip-coating process. It is a versatile process able to produce either thin ceramic coatings or thick deposits. The main advantage of this method is to decrease the crystallization temperature, much lower than conventional processes. Moreover, the sol-gel process is a nondirectional deposition technique, which is very different to the physical methods described above. Doped zirconia have been chosen to constitute isolating multilayers coatings. Sol formulation, slurries stability but also dip-coating conditions have been optimized in order to obtain homogeneous layers on nickel based superalloys substrates.

AB Partitioning behaviour of alloying elements (V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, W, Hf, Zr, Mn, Fe, Co, Cu, Al, Si) between the gamma' (L1(2):Ni3Al), eta(DO24:Ni3Ti), beta(1)(B2: NiAl), beta(2)(B2: NiTi) and H(L2(1):Ni2AlTi) phases in the Ni-Al-Ti base systems at 1100 degrees C has been studied mainly by the diffusion couple method. It is confirmed that (1) in the cases of equilibria between the phases H and beta(1) and H and beta(2), the elements with large atomic size such as Ta, Nb and Hf prefer to partition to the Ti-rich H phase and, (2) in the cases of equilibria between the H, gamma' and eta phases, the bcc elements such as Zr, V and Cr prefer to concentrate into the H phase rather than into the gamma' or eta phases, and (3) in the case of equilibrium between the gamma' and the eta phases, the elements with a large atomic size such as Ta, Zr, W, Hf, Nb and Mo prefer to partition to the eta phase rather than to the gamma' phase. It is suggested that the size factor and the lattice stability of the component elements have a significant effect on the relative stability of these intermetallic phases. These data on the partition behaviour of alloying elements in the Ni-Al-Ti base system are likely to prove useful for alloy design involving Ni-base superalloys.

AB The hot-section components in commercial aerogas turbines were typically made of nickel-based superalloys and were protected by coatings. Two kinds of diffusion aluminide coatings, including simple aluminide coating and NiCr-CrAl coating, were prepared on a nickel-based cast superalloy by LP-VCD and pack cementation techniques, respectively. The isothermal oxidation behavior of the cast alloy and the coatings at 1000 and 1100 degrees C and their hot corrosion behaviors in the presence of 75 wt.% Na2SO4+K2SO4 film at 900 degrees C were studied using TGA, scanning electron microscopy (SEM)/energy-dispersive spectrometry (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and electron probe microanalysis (EPMA), respectively. The results showed that NiCr-CrAl coating, not only held a very excellent oxidation resistance due to the alpha-Al2O3 formation on the coating surface during the isothermal process at 1000 and 1100 degrees C, but also possessed excellent hot corrosion resistance in sulphate melt. Internal oxidation and nitridation were found in the cast alloy during the oxidation process. Moreover, the cast alloy suffered from catastrophic hot corrosion, resulting in the serious internal oxidation and sulfidation. The oxidation resistance of the simple aluminide coating was superior to the cast alloy; the simple aluminide coating was damaged completely and lost its protective effect after the hot corrosion test. In addition, the mechanisms for oxidation and corrosion of the cast alloy and the coatings are discussed simultaneously. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Effects of cyclic stress and temperature on oxidation damage of a
   nickel-based superalloy
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB Oxidation damage, combined with fatigue, is a concern for nickel-based superalloys utilised as disc rotors in high pressure compressor and turbine of aero-engines. A study has been carried out for a nickel-based alloy RR1000, which includes cyclic experiments at selected temperatures (700-800 degrees C) and microscopy examination using focused ion beam (FIB). The results suggest that the major mechanism of oxidation damage consists of the formation of surface oxide scales and internal micro-voids and oxide particles beneath the oxide scales, which become more severe with the increase of temperature. Applying a cyclic stress does not change the nature of oxidation damage but tends to enhance the extent of oxidation damage for temperatures at 750 degrees C and 800 degrees C. The influence of cyclic stress on oxidation damage appears to be insignificant at 700 degrees C, indicating a combined effect of cyclic stress and temperature. Further energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDXS) analyses show the enrichment of Cr and Ti, together with lower Ni and Co levels, in the surface oxide scales, suggesting the formation of brittle Cr2O3, TiO2, NiO and Co3O4 oxides on the specimen surface. Penetration of oxygen into the material and associated internal oxidation, which leads to further material embrittlement and associated failure, are evidenced from both secondary ion imaging and EDXS analyses.

TI Creep of face-centered-cubic {111} and {100} grains in FeCoNiCrMn and
   FeCoNiCrMn-Al alloys: Orientation and solid solution effects
SO INTERMETALLICS
AB In this study, creep behavior of the face-centered-cubic (FCC) {111} and (1001 grains in single-phase Fe20Co20Ni20Cr20Mn20 and dual-phase Fe(18)Co(18)Ni(20)Cr(18)Mn(18)A(18) high-entropy alloys (HEAs) was evaluated using a nanoindentation method over temperatures range of 300-600 degrees C. We measured the creep response of the two different grain orientations in the two alloys in order to study the orientation and solid-solution effects. Creep stress exponent (similar to 3.8-5.0) and activation energy (240-260 kJ/mol) were extracted and analyzed from stain rate-stress and stain rate-temperature data to provide information on the creep mechanism. The results indicated that creep was controlled by dislocation climb in both alloys at both orientations. However, we pointed out that, based upon activation energy value alone, it was difficult to identify which elemental constituent would be the dominant diffusing species responsible for vacancy diffusion during the climb. It was found that creep activation volume for the current two HEAs (140 angstrom(3) or similar to 12 Omega, where Omega is the atomic volume) at 600 degrees C is larger than that reported for the Ni-based superalloys (similar to 50-100 angstrom(3) or less) within a similar temperature range. The significance of this larger activation volume is also discussed.

   superalloy in Na2SO4-60%V2O5 environment at 900 degrees C - Part I:
   Characterization of the coatings
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING AND PERFORMANCE
AB This article demonstrates the successful formulation of NiCrBSi, Cr3C2-NiCr, Ni-20Cr, and Stellite-6 coatings on an Fe-based superalloy by a high-velocity oxyfuel (HVOF) process for hot corrosion applications. The microstructure, porosity, coating thickness, phase formation, and microhardness properties of the coatings have been characterized using the combined techniques of optical microscopy, x-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive x-ray analysis. A microhardness tester was used to determine the hardness of the coatings. The coatings in general exhibit characteristic splat-like, layered morphologies due to the deposition and resolidification of successive molten or semimolten powder particles. The NiCrBSi, Cr3C2-NiCr, and Ni-20Cr coatings have shown a nickel-base face-centered cubic (fcc) structure as a principal phase, whereas Stellite-6 coating has an fcc Co-rich metallic matrix. Oxides/spinel oxides are formed in small fraction as intersplat lamellae or globules oriented parallel to the substrate surface. Coatings possess some unmelted/partially melted particles, inclusions, and porosity less than 2%. The microhardness of the coatings is found to be higher than the superalloys. The Cr3C2-NiCr coating has indicated a maximum microhardness of 990 Hv, while a Ni-20Cr coating has shown a minimum value of about 600 Hv. This article is focused on the characterization of HVOF coatings. The hot corrosion behavior of these coatings in a molten salt (Na2SO4-60%V2O5) environment at 900 degrees C under cyclic conditions is being presented as part II included in this issue.

TI Improving the hot corrosion resistance of boiler tube steels by
   detonation gun sprayed coatings in actual boiler of thermal power plant
SO ANTI-CORROSION METHODS AND MATERIALS
AB Purpose This paper aims to investigate the hot corrosion behavior of Ni-Cr and Cr3C2-NiCr coatings, deposited on T11, P91 boiler steels by detonation gun spray coating (D-Gun) process to enhance high temperature corrosion resistance. Design/methodology/approach Hot corrosion studies were conducted in secondary super heater zone of boiler at 900 degrees C for 10 cycles on bare and D-Gun coated steel specimens. The microhardness and porosity values of as-sprayed coatings were measured before exposing the specimens in the boiler environment. Each cycle consisted 100 h of heating in the boiler environment followed by 20 min of cooling in air. The weight change measurements were performed after each cycle to establish the kinetics of corrosion using thermogravimetric technique. X-ray diffraction, SEM techniques were used to analyze the corroded specimens. Findings Uncoated boiler steel experienced higher weight loss. The Cr3C2-NiCr coating was found to be more protective than Ni-Cr coating. The phases revealed the formation of oxide scale on coated specimens, mainly consist of nickel and chromium, which are reported to be protective against the hot corrosion. Originality/value There is very limited reported literature on hot corrosion behavior of Ni-Cr and Cr3C2-NiCr coatings deposited on the T11 and P91 substrates by detonation gun (D-gun) spray technique. T11 and P91 alloy steels have been chosen for this study because these two alloys are used to manufacture boiler tubes used in Indian thermal power plants.

TI Hot corrosion behavior of HVOF-sprayed Cr3C2-WC-NiCoCrMo coating
SO CERAMICS INTERNATIONAL
AB A novel binary carbide-based sprayed powder, consisting of hard phases (Cr3C2, WC) and matrix phase (NiCoCrMo), was designed to ensure the harsh environments (corrosion, wear, and high temperature) of power plant boilers. A Cr3C2-WC-NiCoCrMo coating was deposited by high-velocity oxygen-fuel (HVOF) process using an agglomerated and sintered Cr3C2-WC-NiCoCrMo powder with a particle size of -45+15 mu m. Hot-corrosion tests were performed under cyclic conditions using a NaCl-KCI-Na2SO4 salt environment, at temperatures up to 500 degrees C. High-temperature oxidation was performed at 500 degrees C. For comparison, corrosion and oxidation tests were also performed on a commercial Cr3C2-25(NiCr) coating, and the corrosion resistance was evaluated by measuring the thickness of the corrosion scale. The properties of the specimens were characterized using X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive spectroscopy. The Cr3C2-WC-NiCoCrMo and Cr3C2-25(NiCr) coatings exhibited similar oxidation-resistance properties. The Cr3C2-WC-NiCoCrMo coating exhibited superior corrosion resistance to that of the Cr3C2-25(NiCr) coating. In the case of the Cr3C2-WC-NiCoCrMo coating, the thickness of the corrosion scale was approximately one-third that of the Cr3C2-25(NiCr) coating. The hot-corrosion resistance imparted by the Cr3C2-WC-NiCoCrMo coating may be attributed to the formation of alloy phases during the powder and coating manufacturing process, as well as to the formation of Cr, W, Ni, Co and Mo oxides, and Ni and Cr spinels.

TI Preparation and Structure of Al plus Si Codeposited Coatings on.
   Ni-based Superalloys
SO RARE METAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING
AB The Al+Si codeposited coatings were prepared on DZ417G superalloy substrates by aluminization and siliconization using pack cementation. XRD, SEM and EDS were used to study the microstructure and morphology of coatings. The results show that during the co-deposition process, the structure formed on the coating surface changes with the change of Al and Si contents. In addition, the post heat-treatment also has an effect on the structure of coatings. When the composition (in wt%) of the packs is XAl-4NH(4)Cl-4Si-(92-X)Al2O3 (X= I, 4 and 6), the corresponding structures of the coatings are NiSi and Ni2Al3 after pack cementation, respectively. When Si content increases to 6 wt% and 10 wt%, the structure of the coatings is also NiSi or Ni2Al3. After post heat-treatment, because of Ni, Cr and Mo diffusion from the substrate, NiSi transforms to AlNi6Si3 or S-Ni2Si, while Ni2Al3 transforms to beta-NiAl. The Si level in the beta-NiAl coatings is very small. Cr or Mo dissolves into AlNi6Si3, delta-Ni2Si and beta-NiAl. Al content plays a role in the formations of coatings. When Al content is low in the pack, the structure of coatings is NiSi after Al + Si codeposition. However, when the Al content is above 4 wt%, the structures of coatings are Ni2Al3 after pack cementation. Cr-rich AlNi6Si3, Cr- and Mo-rich delta-Ni2Si as well as beta-NiAl coatings are formed after Al + Si codeposition followed by post heat-treatment.

Early experiments demonstrated that baking immediately after plating mitigated whiskering and this effect was attributed to hydrogen relief. Baking immediately following plating is now widely used to mitigate whiskering, but this effect is routinely attributed to stress relief. A review of recent experimental and theoretical work oil till whiskering, and oil the behavior of hydrogen dissolved into metals has been performed, in all effort to discern whether dissolved hydrogen merits renewed consideration. Recent studies suggest that lower cathode efficiency during electroplating, which implies a higher rate of hydrogen co-deposition, also increases whiskering propensity. Other studies show that the hydrogen content of till electrodeposits call vary by more than a factor of 20. Recent tin whisker growth theories identify the grain boundaries as critical for the whisker phenomenon. Extensive experimental and theoretical work indicate that dissolved hydrogen can have a significant effect oil grain boundaries in a wide range of metals. Studies oil high-temperature behavior of steels and superalloys indicate that the presence of trace impurities concentrated within grain boundaries have a significant effect on macroscopic properties. Since tin is operating in a high-temperature regime at room temperature, trace impurities should also have a significant impact oil macroscopic properties that are dependent upon grain boundaries, such as whiskering. It is recommended that till whisker investigators consider hydrogen content and the content of other trace contaminants as part of their experimental design. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

   Alloys Containing 35 to 45 pct Cr and 3.5 to 6 pct Nb
SO METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND
   MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Ni-based alloys with high Cr contents are not only known for their excellent high temperature and hot corrosion resistance, but are also known for poor mechanical properties and difficult workability. Powder metallurgical (PM) manufacturing of alloys may overcome several of the shortcomings encountered in materials manufacturing involving solidification. In the present work, six PM Ni-based alloys containing 35 to 45 wt pct Cr and 3.5 to 6 wt pct Nb were produced and compacted via hot isostatic pressing. Samples were heat treated for up to 1656 hours at either 923 K or 973 K (650 A degrees C or 700 A degrees C), and the microstructures and mechanical properties were quantified and compared to thermodynamic calculations. For the majority of the investigated alloys, the high Cr and Nb contents caused development of primary populations of globular alpha-Cr and delta (Ni3Nb). Transmission electron microscopy of selected alloys confirmed the additional presence of metastable gamma aEuro(3) (Ni3Nb). A co-dependent growth morphology was found, where the preferred growth direction of gamma aEuro(3), the {001} planes of gamma-Ni, caused precipitates of both alpha-Cr and delta to appear in the form of mutually perpendicular oriented disks or plates. Solution heat treatment at 1373 K (1100 A degrees C) followed by aging at 973 K (700 A degrees C) produced a significant strength increase for all alloys, and an aged yield strength of 990 MPa combined with an elongation of 21 pct is documented for Ni 40 wt pct Cr 3.5 wt pct Nb.

AB The development of new binder matrices and a fine hard phase have been studied in order to improve the properties of cermet material because TiC has a low stiffness and toughness at high temperature in spite of its high melting point, high hardness, oxidation and corrosion resistance, good thermal stability, and thermal shock resistance. Ni3Al intermetallics are great candidate binder matrices for some structural applications, especially those at the high temperature instead of Co or Ni. This permanently ordered compound up to its melting point has attracted wide interest since it is the prototype of one constituent phase of Ni-base superalloys strengthened by gamma'phase precipitation. This research focused on the fabrication of Ni3Al-Al2O3/TiC composite materials by spark plasma sintering. Raw powders of Ni, Al, TiH2 and activated carbon were milled in a planetary mill to fabricate Ni3Al-Al2O3/TiC cermet. These mixtured powders were consolidated by spark plasma sintering up to 1,350A degrees C in vacuum atmosphere under 10(-3) Torr. Ni3Al-Al2O3/TiC composite was directly synthesized by dehydrogenation and carburization reaction during sintering process. In situ sintered Ni3Al-Al2O3/TiC composite materials were formed by spark plasma sintering above 1,100A degrees C with 10-h milled powders. In the case of spark plasma sintering for 5 min at 1,350A degrees C, it indicated a hardness value of 71 HRC and a relative density of 94.6% through the influence of rapid densification and fine TiC particle reinforced Ni3Al-base composites materials.

   thermally sprayed CoNiCrAlY bond coat alloy
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB This paper investigates the beta-phase coarsening behaviour during isothermal heat treatment of freestanding CoNiCrAlY (Co-31.7%Ni-20.8%Cr-8.1%Al-0.5%Y, all in wt%) coatings prepared by high velocity oxy-fuel (HVOF) thermal spraying. The microstructure of the coatings was characterised using scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD). It comprises a two phase structure of fcc gamma-Ni matrix and bcc beta-NiAl precipitates. The volume fraction of the gamma-Ni and the beta-NiAl phases were measured to be around 70% and 30% respectively, with grain sizes varying largely from 0.5 to 2 mu m for both phases. Isothermal heat treatments of the freestanding coatings were carried out at 1100 degrees C for times up to 250 h. The beta-phase coarsening behaviour during isothermal heat treatments was analysed by quantitative metallography. It is shown that the coarsening behaviour of beta phase in the CoNiCrAlY alloy followed the classical Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner (LSW) theory of Ostwald ripening. By incorporating a dimensionless factor Which correlates with volume fraction of the beta phase, a modified LSW model coupled with formulaic interfacial energy and effective diffusion coefficient of the CoNiCrAlY alloy was utilised to interpret the coarsening behaviour of the beta phase. The coarsening rate coefficient obtained from the modified LSW model shows good agreement with the corresponding experimental result. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB in this study, the Hastelloy-X superalloy samples were firstly overlaid by a CoNiCrAlY bond coating utilizing a high pressure, high velocity oxygen fuel (HVOF) spray process. Then platinum thin film approx. 7.5 mu m thick was introduced to selected test samples of CoNiCrAlY coatings by a magnetron sputtering deposition process. Then the HVOF sprayed superalloy coupons, with and without Pt coating were pack aluminized for 4 h at 850 degrees C to produce (Co,Ni)Al and PtAl2 aluminide phases on their surfaces, respectively. All specimens were subjected to a thermal cycling test at 1100 degrees C. Then the aluminizing and Pt-aluminizing effects relative to cyclical oxidation behavior and microstructure evolutions of the coatings were evaluated. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffractometry (XRD) and electron probe microanalyzer (EPMA) were used to identify crystalline phases and microstructures of each coating. Results clearly indicated that the surface roughness of the HVOF sprayed CoNiCrAlY coatings were unchanged after aluminizing or the Pt-aluminizing process. The oxide scales spalled after 50 h and 100 h cyclic oxidation for the HVOF sprayed sample and aluminized sample respectively, while the oxide scale attached successfully to the substrate for the Pt-aluminized sample after testing for 150 h. It is obvious that the Pt-aluminizing process significantly improves the oxidation resistance of HVOF sprayed coatings, while the isolated aluminizing process demonstrated negligible effect.

AB An investigation was made on the effct of stirring on the microstructures, distribution of solute elements, carbide formation, phosphorus segregation and distribution coefficients between solid and liquid phases in the the Ni-base Superalloy TMP-3 (Ni-11.15%Cr-6.74%Co-3.12%Mo-3.98%Al-2.74%Ti-3.93%Nb-3.25%W) by rheocasting with the rotation of a stirrer at a speed in the range of 20 to 70 rev/s. The main results obtained are summarized as follows:
   (1) When the TMP-3 superalloy was sufficiently agitated at 70 s-1 from the start of solidification, the dendrite structure was broken up and equiaxed grain structure with the average primary solid particle size of 65 +/- 15-mu-m was formed.
   (2) The distributions of Ni, Cr, Co, Al, Ti, Mo, Nb, W, P and C in the superalloy TMP-3 ingots rheocast at 70 s-1 and stationarily cast were measured by using a computer-aided microanalyzer (CMA). The concentrations of main eight metallic elements in the center of equiaxed grains in the rheocast alloy were almost equal to those in the center of dendrites in the stationary cast alloy.
   (3) It was observed from the measurement of the distribution of Ti and Al that the size of gamma' phases in the rheocast alloy tend to decrease as compared with that in the stationarily cast one.
   (4) It was observed that granular MC carbides containing mainly Nb, Ti and Mo precipitate uniformly along the grain boundary in the rheocast alloy, although the plate-like MC carbides precipitate in the grain boundary of the stationary cast alloy.
   (5) The distribution of P measured by CMA showed that P segregates considerably in the grain boundary, but the degree of phosphorous segregation in the rheocast alloy tend to decrease as compared with that in the stationary cast one.
   (6) The solid-liquid distribution coefficients estimated from the concentration of main eight elements in the center of primaly crystals were almost consistent with the equilibrium distribution coefficients obtained by thermodynamic calculation including an additional consideration on solute interactions.

A thin platinum film around 7.5 mu m thick was further applied to the surface of CoNiCrAlY coating by the magnetron sputtering deposition. Then the superalloy coupons with bare bond coat and with Pt deposited bond coat were pack aluminized at 850 degrees C for 4 h to produce (Ni,Co)Al and PtAl2 phases on surfaces, respectively. After that, all samples were overlaid with the yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) top coats by air plasma spraying (APS). Then specimens were subjected to a thermal cycling test at 1100 degrees C. Thermal cycling tests were 1 h at 1100 degrees C followed by 10 min of forced-air cooling to ambient temperature outside the furnace. The weights of all the specimens were measured every 2 cycles. Then effects of aluminizing and Pt-aluminizing on the cyclic oxidation performance and microstructure evolutions of the coatings were evaluated. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffractometry (XRD) and electron probe microanalyzer (EPMA) were used to identify crystalline phases and microstructures of each coating. The results proved that the roughness of the CoNiCrAlY coating was not changed after the aluminizing or the Pt-aluminizing process. The specific weight gain of the thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) with aluminizing or with Pt-aluminizing bond coating was lower than that of TBCs with only HVOF sprayed bond coat. The cyclic oxidation life of sprayed MCrAlY/ZrO2-Y2O3 thermal barrier coating can be improved effectively by either aluminizing or Pt-aluminizing treatment. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.

SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB CoCrAlYTaCSi alloy coating and CoCrAlYTaCSi Al2O3. composite coating were prepared on Inconel 718 alloy substrate by high velocity oxy-fuel (HVOF) spraying in order to avoid the failure of the hot parts made of the Ni-based alloy induced by oxidation and wear damage at elevated temperature of up to 1000 degrees C, with which the agglomerated powder of CoCrAlYTaCSi and Al2O3 was sintered to afford the to-be-sprayed CoCrAlYTaCSi-Al2O3 powder. The microstructure and phase composition of the as-sprayed coatings were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction, and their mechanical properties were determined with a Vicker's hardness tester and a nano-indentation tester. Furthermore, the oxidation behavior of the coatings was evaluated by thermogravimetry and oxidation test in muffle furnace, and their friction and wear behavior under dry sliding against Si3N4 ball from room temperature to 1000 degrees C was evaluated with a high temperature tribometer. Results show that Ta, C and Si elements mainly exist in the forms of TaC and SiC nano-particles in as-sprayed coatings. The incorporation of Al2O3 dispersion results in a significant increase in the hardness, modulus, contact stiffness and wear resistance, but metallic Co and Cr slightly reduce the oxidation resistance of CoCrAlYTaCSi coating. Particularly, as-fabricated CoCrAlYTaCSi-Al2O3 coating exhibits much better wear resistance than CoCrAlYTaCSi coating and other MCrAlY/oxide metal-matrix coatings prepared by HVOF or other technologies, showing promising potential as a protective coating of Ni-alloy based hot parts.

TI FUNDAMENTAL-ASPECTS OF HIGH-TEMPERATURE CORROSION
SO JOURNAL DE PHYSIQUE IV
AB Some recent considerations in three widely different aspects of high-temperature corrosion are summarized: 1) reactions at the metal/scale interface in support of scale growth; 2) mass transfer effects in the control of evaporation of volatile reaction products; and 3) the co-deposition of multiple elements for diffusion coatings using halide-activated cementation packs. The climb of misfit edge dislocations from the metal/scale interface can achieve the annihilation of vacancies associated with scales grown by cation diffusion. For scale growth at the metal/scale interface by anion diffusion, the creation of anion vacancies occurs by the climb of misorientation dislocations. For cation-diffusing scales, a blocking of the vacancy annihilation reaction may be achieved by the specific adsorption of reactive elements at the metal/scale interface. The pinning of the interfacial misfit dislocations by segregated reactive elements can explain the changes in growth mechanism, in growth stresses, and in reaction kinetics associated with the reactive element effect for the growth of chromia scales on alloys. Although the vapor pressures of volatile species are readily calculated from available thermodynamic data, the use of these values to predict the kinetics of transport-limited evaporation has not been presented specifically for various substrate geometries and differing flow conditions. The empirical mass transfer relations are evaluated and plotted for the flat plat and tube geometries in the laminar and turbulent flow regimes. A criterion for the stability of a flat interface in selective evaporation from an alloy is still lacking. Despite the inherent difficulty to codeposit two or more elements with greatly differing thermodynamic stabilities for their halide species, cementation coating packs can be designed with selected combinations of powdered masteralloys and halide activator salts whereby elements are codeposited to yield a desirable surface composition. Selected examples for effective aluminizing/chromizing of Ni-base superalloys and for chromizing/siliconizing of steels are presented.

TI CREEP MECHANISM OF A Ni-Co BASE WROUGHT SUPERALLOY
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB Ni-based wrought superalloys are widely used in the hot section of aircraft gas turbine engines for their capability in retaining strength and resisting creep, fatigue, and oxidation at elevated temperature. With the development of the newer generation turbine disk alloys, it is highly imperative for aircraft engine manufacturers to substantiate the use of the materials by conducting a thorough examination of their mechanical properties. As these components are subjected to elevated temperatures and complex stress state in the service process where time dependent creep is the primary deformation failure mechanism and life-limiting factor for the component, it is of great importance to evaluate the relationship between microstructure, creep behavior and the underlying creep deformation mechanism. Therefore, the main objective of the present research aims at investigating the fundamental relationship between external creep condition and internal creep deformation mechanism in a new wrought superalloy with low stacking fault energy (SFE). In order to study the influences of the loading stress level and temperature on the creep deformation mechanism, stress range of 345-840 MPa and temperature range of 650-815 degrees C were selected to carry out the creep experiment. The results show that two kinds of gamma' with different diameters distributed in the matrix and the larger one began to coarsen when the creep temperature increased to 725 degrees C. Under creep temperature of 650 degrees C, the formation of SF resulted from the shearing of gamma' by dislocations dominated the creep deformation. When the temperature range was raised up to 725-760 degrees C, SF and microtwins were the main microstructures after creep deformation. With further increasing the temperature and load, instead of accommodating only in the gamma', the SF and microtwins penetrated the whole gamma' and matrix area. When the temperature was increased to 815 degrees C, the climb/bypass mechanism controlled the creep process.

TI Atomic-scale observation and analysis of chemical ordering in M3B2 and
   M5B3 borides
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB Secondary phases precipitated in diffusion affected zones (DAZs) of a transient liquid phase (Tip) bonded Ni-based superalloy have a large impact on materials properties. Here we report an atomic-scale analysis of the crystal structures and elemental distributions within DAZ precipitates in a TLP-bonded single-crystal superalloy using a range of electron microscopy techniques. The predominant precipitate phases are found to be M3B2- and M5B3-type borides, where M is a mixture of transition metal elements. Atomically-resolved energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy in an aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) enabled the distributions of metal atoms within the precipitates to be determined. The observation that different metals occupy preferred sites within the crystals indicates that these phases are not uniform solid solutions, but instead are chemically ordered. Both borides contain two distinct metal lattice sites such that the phases can be described as L2SB2 and L4SB3, where L and S are elements with larger (e.g., W, Mo) and smaller (e.g., Cr, Co, Ni) atomic numbers, respectively. Ordering of W and Cr is found to be particularly strong. A systematic search for stable phases within the chemical space of the W-Cr-B ternary system using the crystal structure prediction (CSP) program USPEX provided further insights into the nature of the observed chemical ordering. This combination of STEM and CSP techniques provides a direct and robust way of determining chemical features and local structures of multicomponent phases with atomic resolution even when particle sizes are too small for analysis using conventional methods.

TI Controlling mechanical properties of additively manufactured hastelloy X
   by altering solidification pattern during laser powder-bed fusion
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB Like other manufacturing processes, controlling the microstructure of additively manufactured parts is essential to reach the desirable mechanical properties. However, available reports on the control of as-build microstructure and mechanical properties of Ni-base superalloys during laser powder-bed fusion (LPBF) process are not comprehensive. This article aims at a systematic approach to study the effect of scanning strategies and build orientations on solidification patterns in the printed LPBF Hastelloy X parts. The as-built microstructure (grain size, texture) and mechanical responses (yield strength, ultimate tensile strength (UTS), and elongation) are also presented. Results reveal that the stripe unidirectional scan pattern leads to the largest grain size ( > 850 mu m) with the lowest mechanical strength. These samples also exhibit the strongest crystallographic texture, resulting in a planar anisotropic mechanical response (similar to 22 MPa difference in UTS). On the other hand, the stripe rotation scan strategy (67 rotation) leads to a randomly oriented and finer grain structure (similar to 110 mu m) with a higher UTS (similar to 800 MPa) due to grain refinement observed in these samples. In addition, the aspect ratio of the columnar grain structure was observed to influence the mechanical response of these parts. UTS of horizontally printed parts were 26% more than the vertical parts for the stripe scan strategy (67 degrees rotation). However, changing the solidification pattern (stripe XY with 90 degrees rotation) was observed to reduce this difference to similar to 18%. These findings can be used to tune the microstructure of as-built LPBF parts to obtain an optimal mechanical behaviour.

AB The thermal barrier coatings (TBC) enable to lower temperature (at approx. 170 degrees C) of operating elements in a hot section of gas turbine to a range, which enables to operate for a long time in conditions of high temperature influence and prolongs operation of them even three or four times. Usually, the TBC coverings are constructed of four layers:
   superalloys on a base of nickel;
   outer ceramic zone, from which low thermal conduction is required It is, in most cases, ZrO(2) oxide stabilized with Y(2)O(3) (YSZ yttria stabilized zirconia), material of one of lowest values of thermal conductivity in high temperature of a rank 2.3 Wm(-1)K(-1) in 1000 degrees C for 100% density and thermal expansion of a rank 11x10(-6)degrees C-1, what enables to reduce thermal stresses. Usually, thickness of an outer ceramic layer is within a range 250-375 mu m;
   bond coat of a type Ni(Co)CrAlY or diffusion layer of a type (Ni,Pt)Al;
   layer of barrier oxides, accrueting as a result of temperature growth TGO (thermally grown oxide).
   In the present study characterization of conventional micro-sized YSZ powders stabilized by 8% of yttria and in comparison nano-sized YSZ will be presented. The tests performed showed that the monoclinic phase content in the nanocrystalline powder is approx. 8.8%, and approx 7.5% in the conventional powder. The chemical composition analysis and test of powder microstructure were also performed Carbon, sulphur and gas nitrogen contents were determined and the results received were similar The surface morphology and powder microstructure on the cross-sections were also characterized. The standard powder with spherical shape and relatively smooth surface is predominant. The internal structure is characterized by the presence of tiny sintered particles and low porosity. The nanocrystalline powder tests showed the presence of particles in the form of tiny polyhedrons with bimodal size distribution of particles (approx. 1 mu m and 10 mu m).

TI Residual Stresses in Inertia-Friction-Welded Dissimilar High-Strength
   Steels
SO METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND
   MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB The welding of dissimilar alloys is seen increasingly as a way forward to improve efficiencies in modern aeroengines, because it allows one to tailor varying material property demands across a component. Dissimilar inertia friction welding (IFW) of two high-strength steels, Aermet 100 and S/CMV, has been identified as a possible joint for rotating gas turbine components and the resulting welds are investigated in this article. In order to understand the impact of the welding process and predict the life expectancy of such structures, a detailed understanding of the residual stress fields present in the welded component is needed. By combining energy-dispersive synchrotron X-ray diffraction (EDSXRD) and neutron diffraction, it has been possible to map the variations in lattice spacing of the ferritic phase on both sides of two tubular Aermet 100-S/CMV inertia friction welds (as-welded and postweld heat-treated condition) with a wall thickness of 37 mm. Laboratory-based XRD measurements were required to take into account the variation in the strain-free d-spacing across the weld region. It was found that, in the heat-affected zone (HAZ) slightly away from the weld line, residual stress fields showed tensile stresses increasing most dramatically in the hoop direction toward the weld line. Closer to the weld line, in the plastically affected zone, a sharp drop in the residual stresses was observed on both sides, although more dramatically in the S/CMV. In addition to residual stress mapping, synchrotron XRD measurements were carried out to map microstructural changes in thin slices cut from the welds. By studying the diffraction peak asymmetry of the 200-alpha diffraction peak, it was possible to demonstrate that a martensitic phase transformation in the S/CMV is responsible for the significant stress reduction close to the weld line. The postweld heat treatment (PWHT) chosen to avoid any overaging of the Aermet 100 and to temper the S/CMV martensite resulted in little stress relief on the S/CMV side of the weld.

TI Effect of minor additions on the formation of TCP phases in modified
   RR2086 SX superalloys
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB The effect of minor additions (C and Hf) on the formation of topologically closed-packed (TCP) phases in single crystal (SX) superalloy RR2086 has been investigated. The base RR2086 and the modified RR2086 were exposed at 950degreesC for 200-2000 h. It was found that both alloys were very stable in terms of TCP phase precipitation. TCP phases initiated in the dendrite regions in both the base and modified RR2086 and near MC carbides in the modified material as well. However, TCP phases formed faster in the modified RR2086 than in the base RR2086. This indicated that the minor additions in the modified RR2086 expedited the formation of TCP phases. EDX measurements showed that Re, W, Cr and Co were predominant in TCP phases, in agreement with the Scheil simulation; that they also segregated in the dendrite cores in both alloys and near MC carbides in the modified RR2086; and that the segregation was intensified by the minor additions in the modified material. These EDX results can explain the initiation of TCP phases in the dendrite cores in both alloys, the formation of TCP phases near MC precipitates, and the faster TCP phase precipitation in the modified RR2086. In contrast with the RR2086, TCP phase formation was retarded by the same minor additions in the modified RR2072. It was thought that this difference was to due to the formation Of M23C6 phase which was influenced by the concentration of chromium. The higher level of chromium in RR2072 promoted M23C6 phase prior to the precipitation of TCP phases in the modified RR2072 and subsequently retarded the occurrence of sigma phase to a later stage than in the base RR2072. The lower level of chromium in RR2086 suppressed M23C6 precipitation in the modified alloy, and as a result TCP phase precipitation was only influenced by the microsegregation, which led to the faster formation of TCP phases in the modified RR2086 than in the base material.

TI Utilization of hot deformation to trigger strain induced boundary
   migration (SIBM) in Ni-base superalloys
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB The effect of strain on the resultant microstructure of an experimental low stacking fault energy Nickel based superalloy containing 24 wt. pct. Co was investigated. Billets subjected to a preliminary heat treatment at 1110 degrees C were compressed to strain limits of 0.15 and 0.5 at strain rates ranging from 0.1/s to 0.01/s and temperatures at 1020 degrees C and 1060 degrees C. The as-deformed microstructures were assessed and characterized using electron backscatter diffraction, as were microstructures corresponding to a super-solvus anneal heat treatment at 1160 degrees C for one hour. This study sought to identify a critical strain limit at which conditions indicative of Strain induced boundary migration (SIBM) could be effectively triggered for the experimental Ni-based super alloy over a set range of thermal-mechanical parameters. Microstructures corresponding to SIBM were then compared to more extensively deformed billets which contained notable fractions of dynamically recrystallized grains to quantify differences in the length fraction and density of Sigma 3 twin boundaries of the respective microstructures. Though billet samples deformed to both 0.15 and 0.5 contained notable magnitudes of stored strain energy, microstructures deformed to 0.15 were noted as having maintained larger length fractions of Sigma 3 twins due to a predominant absence of dynamic recrystallization. Annealed samples originally deformed to 0.15 yielded annealing twin length fractions as high as 59% when compared a sample deformed to the 0.5 strain limit under equivalent thermal-mechanical conditions that resulted in a twin length fraction of 50%. Although samples deformed to the lower strain limit exhibited higher length fractions of annealing twins, samples deformed to the higher strain limit of 0.5 were noted to yield Sigma 3 densities as high as 0.65 mu m(-1), whereas the annealed sample deformed under equivalent thermal-mechanical parameters to the 0.15 strain limit produced Sigma 3 densities as low as 0.32 mu m(-1).

AB MCrAlY type (M = Ni and/or Co) coatings are widely used for the protection of components in the hot sections of gas turbines at high service temperatures by forming a continuous alpha-alumina. A reliable criterion to estimate the capability of coating to form alpha-alumina is of great importance to accurately evaluate coating lifetime. However, some coatings retain the ability to form a continuous alpha-alumina scale when the concentration of Al in coatings decreases to a critical level, therefore, the empirical Al-concentration based criterion is inadequate to properly predict the formation of a continuous alpha-alumina. Thus, a new life criterion, namely the critical Al-activity criterion, is proposed.
   In this work, the critical Al-activity to form a continuous a-alumina was validated by Al-activity calculation using Thermo-Calc software based on survey of research results of critical Al-concentration to form alpha-alumina on binary Ni-Al and ternary Ni-Cr-Al systems. Long-term oxidation tests were performed to support the criterion: three different MCrAlY coatings coated on IN-792 superalloy substrates were oxidized at 1000 degrees C for various periods of time up to 10,000 h. The microstructural evolution of MCrAlY coatings was investigated using Scanning Electron Microscope. The near-surface Al concentration and interdiffusion behaviour between substrate and coating were measured using Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy. The new critical Al-activity criterion has been successfully adopted in alpha-alumina formation prediction, showing a good agreement with experiment results. Therefore, it can be concluded that the extrapolation of new criterion from binary and ternary systems to multi-alloyed MCrAlY system is reasonable. Furthermore, the partial pressure of oxygen (P-O2) in atmosphere has been taken into consideration by combination with Al-activity to calculate the critical chemical reaction constant (K) of formation of a-alumina. The potential applicability of the methodology to predict MCrAlY life is also discussed.

AB The unirradiated tensile properties for several different heats and thermomechanical treatment conditions of precipitation strengthened Hycon 3HPTM CuNiBe (Cu-2%Ni-0.35%Be in wt.%) have been measured over the temperature range of 20-500 C for longitudinal and long transverse orientations. The room temperature electrical conductivity has also been measured for several heats, and the precipitate microstructure was characterized using transmission electron microscopy. The CuNiBe alloys exhibit very good combination of strength and conductivity at room temperature, with yield strengths of 630-725 MPa and electrical conductivities of 65-72% International Annealed Copper Standard (IACS). The strength remained relatively high at all test temperatures, with yield strengths of 420-520 MPa at 500 degrees C. However, low levels of ductility (<5% uniform elongation) were observed at test temperatures above 200-250 C, due to flow localization near grain boundaries (exacerbated by having only 10-20 grains across the gage thickness of the miniaturized sheet tensile specimens). Scanning electron microscopy observation of the fracture surfaces found a transition from ductile transgranular to ductile intergranular fracture with increasing test temperature. Fission neutron irradiation to a dose of 0.7 displacements per atom (dpa) at temperatures between 100 and 240 degrees C produced a slight increase in strength and a significant decrease in ductility. The measured tensile elongation after irradiation increased with increasing irradiation temperature, with a uniform elongation of 3.3% observed at 240 degrees C. The electrical conductivity decreased slightly following irradiation, due to the presence of defect clusters and Ni, Zn, Co transmutation products. Considering also previously published fracture toughness data, this indicates that CuNiBe alloys have irradiated tensile and electrical properties comparable or superior to CuCrZr and oxide dispersion strengthened copper at temperatures <250 degrees C, and may be an attractive candidate for certain lowtemperature fusion energy structural applications. Conversely, CuNiBe may not be preferred at intermediate temperatures of 250-500 degrees C due to the poor ductility and fracture toughness of CuNiBe alloys at temperatures >250 degrees C. The potential deformation mechanisms responsible for the transition from transgranular to intergranular fracture are discussed. The possible implications for other precipitation-hardened alloys such as nickel based superalloys are briefly discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In recent years great efforts have been made in the development of gamma-TiAl alloys for use in aerospace applications such as turbines, where low densities and high temperature strength are required. However, gamma-TiAl alloys show poor oxidation resistance at temperatures T > 850 degrees C due to the formation of a non-protective oxide layer consisting of a mixture of TiO2 + Al2O3 in air, which could be easily spalled off, resulting in a shortened lifetime of the components. One promising way to overcome this problem is the deposition of an oxidation protective coating with low oxygen permeability at high temperatures. However, the interdiffusion between coating and substrate is still challenging even for advanced oxidation resistant coatings such as MCrAlY (M = Ni or Co) and aluminide. The present work focuses on the (Cr,Al)ON coating system, inspired from its outstanding diffusion barrier properties. Four (Cr,Al)ON coatings with different Cr:Al and N:O ratios were deposited onto gamma-TiAl substrate by the innovative High-Speed Physical Vapor Deposition (HS-PVD) technology, which enables the deposition of oxygen-rich coatings in a stable plasma process without target poisoning. Basing on hollow cathode discharge (HCD) and gas flow sputtering (GFS), the HS-PVD made it possible to deposit (Cr,Al)ON coatings at a deposition rate ds/dt > 16 mu m/h. The as-deposited coatings show an X-ray amorphous structure. Subsequently, the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis confirmed the nanocomposite coating structure. The thermal stability and oxidation behavior of the coatings were evaluated by means of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetry (TGA) between T = 100 degrees C and T = 950 degrees C. It was confirmed that the Xray amorphous structure even remained stable at temperatures up to T = 950 degrees C. Moreover, cross-sectional SEM images of the coated samples after the HT-XRD measurements showed neither the formation of oxides at the coating substrate interface nor the interdiffusion of Ti into the coating, indicating a promising performance of the diffusion barrier. The results of the conducted research reveal a high potential of the HS-PVD deposited (Cr,Al)ON coatings for the oxidation protection of gamma-TiAl at T > 850 degrees C in turbine applications.

AB Laser-assisted forming is a method based on contactless shaping of profiles with the use of a laser beam impact. This method has been developed from the early 1980s by the Centre for Laser Technology of Metals at the Kielce University of Technology (PSk) and the Polish Academy of Sciences (PAN), among others [1-7]. In general, the mechanism allowing for changing the shape of profiles is the material's thermal expansion. Suitable profile heating (on programmed paths with an adequately selected temperature, etc.) allows for obtaining the planned shapes.
   Despite certain areas of application (electrical mechanics, precision mechanics, micro-positioning and others), this method is ineffective [4-5]. When changing the shape of large-diameter profiles, this method is power and time consuming, thereby eliminating it from industrial applications. Thus, the concept of a hybrid method was created, i.e. laser forming with mechanical assistance.
   In 2015, PSk established co-operation with the Metal Forming Institute (INOP) in Poznan, PAN's Institute of Fundamental Technological Research, and the Rzeszow University of Technology in terms of research in the aforementioned topic. The above consortium commenced the execution of the project titled "Laser forming of thin-walled profiles with mechanical assistance, financed by the National Centre for Research and Development as part of subsidy no. PBS3/A5/47/2015.
   The paper's authors will present, among other things, the main concept of hybrid laser and mechanical forming, one of the concepts selected for the execution, design and construction of a station for bending thin-walled tubes and cone diffusers used in the construction of aircraft engines. The target materials of the research are Inconel 618 and Inconel 625 refractory nickel superalloys, as well as AISI 410 and AISI 325 heat-resistant Martensitic steels. These materials, due to their good mechanical properties when working at higher temperatures, are used for building turboprop engines. For economic reasons, the testing was conducted on X5CrNi18-10 acid-resistant austenitic steel. The hybrid method (assumptions, concept, design) presented in the paper was subjected to validation in laboratory conditions. The testing featured measurements of the forces required to obtain plastic deformations in the profile, bending angle, and determination of the process temperature. Furthermore, the paper will feature a presentation of future plans concerning the work executed as part of the said project.

TI Solidification and Segregation Behavior of Cast Ni-Base Superalloy IN792
SO RARE METAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING
AB The solidification process of cast Ni-base superalloy IN792 was comparatively investigated by differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) and isothermal solidification quenching (ISQ) experiment. The distribution characteristics of elements in solidified solid and residual liquid at different temperatures were also concerned. The isothermal solidification microstructure, the phase precipitation diagram, the solidification characteristic curve and the segregation behavior of elements at different temperatures in liquidus and solidus range were obtained. The results of ISQ indicate that the IN792 alloy possesses a liquidus temperature of 1328 degrees C. The onset of MC carbides and eutectic (gamma+gamma') formation take place at 1310 and 1225 degrees C, respectively. The secondary gamma' is precipitated at 1190 degrees C. The macro-solidus temperature determined by DSC was 1250 degrees C. The volume fraction of residual liquid at this temperature can reach about 5%. The end of the solidification happened at 1180 degrees C, designated as micro-solidus temperature. No liquid remained at this temperature. There is a 70 degrees C gap between macro and micro-solidus temperature. The hot tearing tends to occur in this temperature range. About 85 vol% solid phase was formed within a range of 30 degrees C below the liquidus temperature. In 1300 similar to 1270 degrees C range, the residual liquid in the interdendritic region changed from connected channels to the isolated micro-liquid pools, which is related to the formation of micro-porosity defect. The distribution coefficient of element W and Co are more than 1, indicating that they tend to distribute in solid phase in dendritic region, which are negative segregation elements. The distribution coefficients of element Zr, Mo, Ti, Ta and Cr are less than 1, indicating that they tend to distribute in liquid phase in interdendritic region, which are positive segregation elements. The element Al tends to distribute to liquid phase at the beginning of the solidification, and then be prone to concentrate in the solid phase in the dendritic region and transform to a negative segregation element followed by the solidification temperature decreased. The distribution coefficient of element Al and Ni increases but Mo and Cr decreases followed by the solidification temperature decreasing in 1325 similar to 1210 degrees C range. On the contrary, The distribution of element Al and Ni decreases but Mo and Cr increases followed by the solidification temperature decreasing in 1210 similar to 1180 degrees C range.

AB Wear resistant and corrosion resistant surfaces are important for medical implants. Wear resistance is especially important for articulating surfaces in load bearing applications such as total hip and total knee replacements. Metal-on-polyethylene bearings result in relative large volumetric wear, ceramics such as alumina have an excellent wear resistance but are brittle, metal-on-metal bearings have good wear resistance, but release nanometric debris and ions that may cause allergy or have toxic effects. Hard ceramic coatings on metal substrates may be a good solution: low wear and low ion release and ductile metal alloy interior-no danger of brittle fracture and easy shaping. Ti alloys such as for example Ti-6Al-4 have the best combination of mechanical properties and biocompatibility, but have very poor wear resistance, Co-Cr-Mo have good wear resistance, but may cause allergy. TiN hard coatings deposited on Ti alloys by PVD have relatively poor adhesion to the substrate as a result limited durability. Hard coatings formed on the surface of Ti alloys, Zr as well as CoCrMo alloys by reactive diffusion have good adhesion to the substrate as a result of gradual change of composition and gradual change of hardness. Reactive diffusion coatings obtained employing developed Powder Immersion Reaction Assisted Coating (PIRAC) on articulating surfaces of Ti alloys and CoCrMo show excellent adhesion to the substrate. Total hip implants show good performance in wear simulator tests as well as in vivo tests in canine and rat models. The thickness of reactive diffusion coatings is proportional to square root from time. It is shown that that thicker TiN coatings can be obtained via 3 stage PIRAC process: nitriding followed by tiatanization and additional PIRAC nitriding. Similar approach in two stages-titanizaton followed by nitriding can be employed for processing on TiN based coatings on CoCrMo alloy. Duplex TiN coatin-TiN PIRAC coating followed by TiN plasma assisted PVD (PAPVD) results in thick coatings with excellent adhesion to the substrate. PIRAC titanization followed by was successfully used for conversion of Ni foam to NiTi Nitinol foam and formation of TiN coating on the surface of Nitinol foam, resulting in 10 fold decrease of Ni ions release into physiological solution. PIRAC nitriding was successfully used also for nitriding of TiNb alloys, Zr and Zr-2.5 Nb alloy. Two stage coating by wear resistant TiN based layer can be applied to steels, BCC metals such as Mo and W and Ni based superalloys.

TI Sulphidation Behavior of a Non Harmful Water-Based Al and Al-Si Slurry
   Coating on CM247 Superalloy
SO OXIDATION OF METALS
AB Slurry aluminide coatings are widely applied to protect metallic surfaces from oxidation and corrosion. They are frequently used in gas turbine engine nozzles because of economical advantages and a straight-forward manufacturing route. A variety of commercial slurries are available to aluminize the surfaces of nickel-based superalloys, however, they have two main disadvantages. First, the phosphates and chromates or halides used as binders and to activate the diffusion species are environmentally harmful; second, the conventional systems have to be heat-treated in an inert atmosphere. As an outcome of the PARTICOAT project the variety of slurry derived coatings has been extended by tailoring the particle size of the metallic source. By doing that, environmentally friendly water-based slurries were developed to produce in a one-step process und atmospheric conditions, a thermal barrier system based on an aluminum diffusion layer and an alumina foam layer which serves as bond coat as well as top coat (TC). CM 247 nickel base superalloy was coated and heat-treated in air using newly developed Al and Al-Si slurries. The oxidation behavior was investigated at 1,000 A degrees C and then compared to pack-cemented aluminide coatings. The sulphidation behavior was investigated at 1,000 A degrees C in an atmosphere of 1.5 vol% SO2 in synthetic air for Al and Al-Si slurry coated samples with and without the alumina foam TC layer. PARTICOAT Al-based slurries,, after the initial stabilization of the TC, showed similar oxidation kinetics as pack cemented aluminides when exposed to air. When the coatings were exposed to sulphide-containing atmospheres, their oxidation rates increased, producing typical type I corrosion damage. Coatings without TC produced more protective oxide scales. The weight gain and coating area affected by corrosion were slightly lower for the Al-based slurries after 1,000 h of exposure than for the Al-Si based ones. The new coating presented here offers unique advantages in comparison to state-of-the-art slurry and pack cemented coatings by opening a potential way to manufacture a complete thermal barrier coating system by a simple, inexpensive and environmentally safe deposition and heat-treatment in air.
