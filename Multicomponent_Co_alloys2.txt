AB Ordering processes typical for Ni-base superalloys were studied in a
   multicomponent system Ni-Al-Cr-Co-W-Re by means of computer modelling
   using Monte Carlo method combined with ab initio calculations.
   Complementary calculations were also run using ThermoCalc software for
   modelling of thermodynamic equilibria. Together with modelling,
   experiments were carried out by means of analytical scanning and
   transmission electron microscopy after a long term annealing at high
   temperatures typical for. application of Ni-based superalloys. The
   microstructure of equilibrium states was characterized as regards the
   phase constitution and chemical composition of phases. The comparison of
   results of applied methods is given.

   paths: (metallic melt) -> (bulk metallic glass precursor of shape memory
   material) -> (superplastic deformation on heating through the
   supercooled liquid region) -> (crystallization and final
   microcrystalline material with martensitic transformation in a
   predetermined temperature range). Main attention is paid to design of
   multicomponent (Ti,ZrHf)(A)(Co,Ni,Cu,Pd)(B) alloys with compositions
   varied around an effective intermetallic compound AB (A:B = 45:55;
   50:50; 55:45). One of the challenging problems here is to find a
   chemical composition window of our multicomponent systems fitting the
   known empirical rules for a high amorphization ability and keeping the
   martensitic transformation and good shape memory properties after
   crystallization.

AB Structure connection tables, which are commonly used for the
   representation of chemical structures in electronic databases, are
   valuable for substances where specific valence bond structures are known
   or can be drawn. However there are many classes of substances (for
   example alloys, catenanes, polymers, or salts) which cannot be fully
   represented by valence bond structures. There are also issues of
   definition (such as when a substance is a co-ordination compound, or
   hydrate, or salt), and of bonding types (resonance, donor complexes,
   pi-complexes). Producers of chemical substance databases may address
   these issues in different ways and generally need to introduce concepts
   (for example multicomponent substances) with which chemical scientists
   may not be familiar. In addition to these aspects of database content,
   the searcher needs to understand the algorithms behind the structure
   search engines. For example, the SciFinder search engine has
   considerable in-built chemical intelligence at the initial search level
   and then has many tools to mine the data once obtained; the CrossFire
   search engine also employs several algorithms by default and allows
   further options to vary them.

   and electrochemical properties of different fractions are determined. It
   is established that all of the fractions have similar morphology and
   alloy lattice parameters. The surface of gas atomized powders with less
   particle size is less contaminated with oxygen compared with larger
   fractions. At the same time fractions with a particle size <50 mum have
   poor activity during gas and electrochemical hydrogenation. DTA curves
   for fractions of fine particles have an additional exothermic peak that
   may be caused by thermally induced transformation of the amorphous
   component into crystalline. The coarse fraction of gas atomized powder
   has the same hydrogen and electrochemical capacity as for fuzzed alloys.

   exchange-biased Ni81Fe19/Fe50Mn50/Co/Pd films. The results in
   conjunction with their model simulations clearly reveal that the

   the individual magnetic layers of such a multicomponent ultrathin
   layered structure on the atomic scales. Significant interference effects
   combined with penetration depth of resonant soft x rays, which are
   closely associated with their absorptive and refractive contributions,
   offer remarkably different depth sensitivities into the Kerr effects
   depending on grazing angle and resonance energy. (C) 2003 American

AB The requirements of the telecommunications, automobile, electronics and
   aircraft industries for non-toxic solders with melting points close to
   that of near-eutectic Pb-Sn alloys has led to the development of new
   Sn-Zn-In solder alloys. Differential thermal analysis (DTA) shows
   melting points of 198, 195, 190 and 185 +/- 2 degreesC for the alloys
   Sn-9Zn, Sn-9Zn-21n, Sn-9Zn-4In and Sn-9Zn-6In, respectively. An equation
   that fits the data relating the melting point to the In content in the
   solders is derived. The X-ray diffraction patterns are analyzed to
   determine the phases that exist in each solder. The stress-strain curves
   are studied in the temperature range from 90 to 130 degreesC for all the
   solders except for those that contain 4 wt% of In, where the temperature
   range continues to 150 degreesC. The work-hardening parameters, sigma(y)
   (the yield stress), sigma(f) (the fracture stress), and the parabolic
   work-hardening coefficient X, increase with increasing indium content in
   the solders at all working temperatures. They decrease with increasing
   working temperature for each solder, and show two relaxation stages only
   for the Sn-9Zn-4In solder around a temperature of 120 degreesC. (C) 2003

   of hydrated nFe(OH)(3) . p-Ni(OH)(2) . xH(2)O; 70<x<110 with n = 12-36
   and p = 0-2 were reacted with mBa(OH)(2) . 8H(2)O (m = 0-4) in aqueous

   which are crystalline by electron diffraction. Dehydroxylation of the
   precursor is accomplished by continuous weight loss as evidenced from
   thermogravimetry and is complete at similar to650degreesC by isothermal
   conditions. Differential thermal analysis showed exothermic peaks
   arising from the recrystallization followed by grain growth of the
   particles at similar to750degreesC. Direct phase evolution of
   hexaferrites are evidenced from X-ray diffraction studies. Monophasic
   nanoparticles of hexaferrites were obtained on heat-treating the
   precursor at 850degreesC. HREM of these crystallites show defect-free,
   regular, coherent growth of structural blocks. The evolution of para- to
   ferrimagnetic phase on heat-treatment is continuous and is through the
   superparamagnetic state. This is associated with a continuous increase
   in magnetization with heat-treatment temperature. Samples heat-treated
   below 850degreesC show diffuse magnetic transition near T-c, which
   results from the intergrowths observed in the lattices. Hysteresis loop
   for various compositions showed significant differences from hard
   ferrite characteristics for M-phase (sigma(s) = 52 emu/g; H-c = 4520 Oe)
   to soft ferrite (sigma(s) = 25.5 emu/g; H-c = 205 Oe) for Y-phase.

AB When high Co-Ni alloy steels are isothermally tempered at 482 degreeC,
   cementite is precipitated first, and then the needle-shaped carbides of
   M2C begin to precipitate in a coherent way with martensitic ferrite
   matrix after 30 min. This coherent:relationship can be hold as long as
   10 h, and tends to be lost when the steels are overaged with increasing
   tempering time. High resolution electron microscopy investigation shows
   that the size of M2C precipitates increases with tempering time
   following the relationship r(2) proportional to t, and this relationship
   c an be confirmed by other studies in some similar alloy steels, which
   obviously deviates from the classical theory of LSW for
   diffusion-controlled coarsening of precipitate particles in binary
   solutions. This result might be related to the multicomponent diffusion
   system as well as the morphology of the precipitates. It indicates that
   the classical theory cannot be used properly to describe the coarsening
   behavior of multi-component carbides even the coarsening controlled by
   volume diffusion. With a view of the needle shaped precipitates and two
   or more solutes diffusion, a model for the coarsening rate of the
   precipitates with time has been derived, which is well consistent with
   the observed results.

   y=0.0, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3) system. Spectral studies have been
   made by EDS and SEM, and the crystal structure was also determined by
   XRD. In order to calculate the hydrogen storage capacity, the
   pressure-composition isotherms (PCT curves) were utilized. The metal
   hydride electrode was also used as a galvanostatic cycling test. As the
   amount of added V or Zr is increased, the portion of the second phase is
   also increased gradually, but the crystal structure, CaCu5-type Laves
   phase, is not changed. But, in the matrix, the main component is Ni, in
   one of the major phases the main component is La and in another minor
   phase the main component is V or Zr. It has been confirmed that the
   addition of V or Zr causes improvement in the discharge capacity (Zr,
   yless than or equal to0.05; V, yless than or equal to0.1) and the
   cyclability (Zr, yless than or equal to0.05; V, yless than or equal
   to0.1) up to 200 cycles. However, adding more than y=0.2 has some
   significant effect on these properties. Generally, V-containing alloys
   may have many second phases of a round shape appearing in dispersed form
   in the matrix, while Zr-containing alloys' second phases appear with a
   plate or needle-like shape. La-rich particles precipitated along
   boundaries of the second phases which can act as sites of preferred
   hydrogen absorption, to increase the discharge capacity. In addition,
   many micro-cracks are formed around the La-rich particles at the surface
   of the La-rich particle itself. Therefore, such second phases are
   considered as catalytic sites for hydrogen penetration, surface
   reaction, initial activation and change transfer properties. (C) 2002

AB AB(5)-type intermetallic compounds were prepared by arc-melting in argon
   atmosphere. The composition of a stoichiometric compound
   LaNi3.6Al0.4Co0.7Mn0.3 with a hexagonal CaCu5 structure was varied by
   stoichiometric and nonstoichiometric addition of Ti. With the increase
   of the Ti yless than or equal to0.05 content in
   LaNi3.6Al0.4Co0.7Mn0.3Tiy, the hydrogen storage capacity is enhanced,
   whereas when y=0.1-0.3, it is decreased. The discharge capacity and
   cyclability are increased considerably by addition of titanium in the
   range of 0.02-0.1 with a maximum value at about 0.1%. The highest
   maximum capacity is achieved for a nonstoichiometric addition of 0.05%
   Ti. The kinetic properties are also additionally improved by the
   formation of a titanium-rich second phase. This can explain the
   improvement of the capacity for alloys with low Ti content. The decrease
   in capacity for high Ti content was also correlated with the amount of
   the Ti-rich phase. Therefore, the improvement of kinetics are due to the
   catalytic effect, grain boundary diffusion effect or more pronounced
   alloy pulverization upon cycling. This study has been aimed to improve
   the electrode properties of a series of multicomponent
   LaNi3.6Al0.4Co0.7Mn0.3Tiy (y=0.0, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3) alloys

   been subjected to analyses by EDS, SEM and XRD. In order to determine
   the hydrogen storage capacity, the pressure composition isotherms (P-C-T
   curves) have been used. The metal hydride electrodes were characterized
   by galvanostatic cycling test. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

AB Solidification modeling based on classical macroscopic energy, mass,
   momentum and solute continuity equations does not allow to predict of
   microstructural parameters satisfactorily. In past decades several
   attemps have been made for the developing of modelling methodology for
   the coupling macro transport equations with the transformation kinetics
   in the micro scale. The micromodeling focused to the multicomponent
   alloys is still rare, despite the majority of the new industrial alloys
   are formed from complex multicomponent systems. The paper presents the
   micromodeling procedure coupled with thermodynamic calculation and
   experimental investigations for the Co-Cr-Mo alloys, frequently used as
   biomaterials for the production of endoprotheses. Both, experimental and
   numerical results showed that: the grain structure is mainly influenced
   by the cooling rate, the partition coefficients exhibit significant
   dependency on the cooling rate (especially for molybdenum), the high
   cooling rate promotes early formation of fine intragranular carbides.
   The experimentally obtained values of latent heat of solidification
   exhibit important dependency on the initial carbon content, and cannot
   be ignored in solidification simulations. The solidification modeling
   results have been verified using cooling curve analysis and
   metallografic investigations. It seems, that the model can be used in
   engineering applications for solidification simulations.

   voltammetric determination of Cu, Pb, Cd, Zn, Fe, Mn, Co, Ni, Sn, Sb and
   Bi in copper alloys. The possibility of determining simultaneously metal
   concentrations in the case of interference of the voltammetric signals
   due to the peak overlapping is also highlighted and discussed. The
   analytical procedure was verified by the analysis of the standard
   reference materials: commercial bronze A NIST-SRM 1115, gunmetal BCS-CRM
   207/2, high tensile brass BCS-CRM 390. Precision and accuracy, expressed
   as relative standard deviation and relative error, respectively, were in
   all cases lower than 6%. The limits of detection for each element were
   also reported.

AB The concept of multicomponent chemical short-range order (MCSRO) domain
   is systematically developed by the experimental investigation of
   Zr-Ti-Cu-Ni-Al bulk metallic glass (BMG) and thermodynamic modeling and
   calculation. The existence of MCSRO domains in Zr-based BMG is verified
   by the observations of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy
   (HRTEM) images and the analysis of nano-beam electron diffraction
   patterns. The size of the nano-beam used in this work is 0.5 nm in
   diameter. Thermodynamic evaluation of the melt composed of
   multiple-MCSRO domains and glass-forming ability (GFA) based on the
   concept of MCSRO domains has also been conducted. It is indicated that
   the thermodynamic calculation of the GFA based on MCSRO model is
   consistent with the experimental data of crystallization activation
   energy and glass transition temperature for Ni-Zr and Zr-Cu binary
   alloys, and with supercooled liquid region (DeltaT(x)) for Zr-Ni-Al
   ternary alloy. The existence of MCSRO domain lowers the free energy of
   the melt (DeltaG(MCSRO)), resulting in a large undercooling and a larger
   energy barrier to the nucleation of a critical crystalline nucleus.
   Large DeltaG(MCSRO), low melting point as well as co-existence of
   multiple MCSRO domains are valid criterion for the valuation of GFA. (C)

   rate of gamma' in Ni-based superalloys, which has been applied to both
   binary Ni-Al alloys and a wide range of multicomponent alloys. A
   standard coarsening equation is utilized, but innovative methods for
   calculating the critical input parameters are presented. The article
   details methods of estimating interfacial energies and the effective
   diffusion coefficients that are key parameters for the coarsening model.
   Self-consistent calculations are made via a computer program in which
   the only input required is the composition of the alloys and the
   temperature of coarsening. The effects of coherent strain on the
   coarsening process have also been analyzed and discussed.

AB Pd43Ni10Cu27P20 has been investigated in its equilibrium liquid state
   with incoherent, inelastic neutron scattering. As compared to simple
   liquids, liquid Pd43Ni10Cu27P20 is characterized by a dense packing with
   a packing fraction above 0.5. The intermediate scattering function
   exhibits a fast relaxation process that precedes structural relaxation.
   Structural relaxation obeys a time-temperature superposition that
   extends over a temperature range of 540 K. The mode-coupling theory of
   the liquid to glass transition [mode-coupling theory (MCT)] gives a
   consistent description of the dynamics that governs the mass transport
   in liquid Pd-Ni-Cu-P alloys. MCT scaling laws extrapolate to a critical
   temperature T-c at about 20% below the liquidus temperature.
   Diffusivities derived from the mean relaxation times compare well with
   Co diffusivities from recent tracer diffusion measurements and
   diffusivities calculated from viscosity via the Stokes-Einstein
   relation. In contrast to simple metallic liquids, the atomic transport
   in dense, liquid Pd43Ni10Cu27P20 is characterized by a drastic slowing
   down of dynamics on cooling and a q(-2) dependence of the mean
   relaxation times at intermediate q as a result of a highly collective
   transport mechanism. At temperatures as high as 2T(c) diffusion in
   liquid Pd43Ni10Cu27P20 is as fast as that in simple liquids at the
   melting point. However, the difference in the underlying atomic
   transport mechanism indicates that the diffusion mechanism in liquids is
   not controlled by the value of the diffusivity but rather by that of the
   packing fraction.

AB A critical analysis of the available experimental data for the effect of
   alloying elements on the isotropic shear modulus of bcc (body-centered
   cube) Fe-X (X=Al, Be, C, Co, Cr, Ge, Ir, Mn, Ni, Pt, Re, Rh, Ru, Si and
   V) solid solutions is carried out. The total effect of a solute on the
   shear modulus is decomposed into two contributions: the electronic (or
   chemical) and the volumetric. A systematic trend of the electronic
   contribution is demonstrated as a function of electron-to-atom (e/a)
   ratio and the ground-state electronic configuration of the solute atom.
   Based on the demonstrated trend, we predict the chemical contribution of
   the shear modulus of Cu, Mo, N, Nb. Ti and W in ferromagnetic alpha-Fe
   (bcc), and that of Ti and V in paramagnetic gamma-Fe [face-centered cube
   (fcc)]. These along with the corresponding volumetric contributions
   enable us to predict the total effect of a solute on the shear modulus
   in alpha-Fe and gamma-Fe. In the case of gamma-Fe, we derive the
   chemical and volumetric contributions of Ni and Pt from the experimental
   shear modulus data of paramagnetic Fe-Ni and Fe-Pt alloys while those of
   C, Co, Cr, Mn. Mo, N and Si are derived front the shear modulus of
   paramagnetic Fe-Ni-X alloys. In the case of Al. Be, Cu, Ge, Ir, Nb, Re,
   Rh, Ru and W, the total effect oil the shear modulus is calculated by
   assuming that the electronic contribution to the shear modulus in
   gamma-Fe is the same as in alpha-Fe. To calculate the isotropic shear
   modulus of multicomponent bcc and fcc solid Solutions, we propose linear
   superposition laws. The proposed relationships are validated using the
   experimental data of a large number of multi-component alloys having
   austenitic, ferritic, and lath martensitic microstructures. It is
   demonstrated that for all three microstructures. in most cases the shear
   modulus can be predicted with an accuracy of +/-3% in multicomponent
   solid solutions. It is also found that the high dislocation density in
   lath martensite accounts for a decrease in shear modulus by about 5%
   compared to the ferritic counterpart. We also demonstrate that the
   temperature dependence of shear modulus in multicomponent bee and fcc
   solid solutions is similar to that of pure alpha- and gamma-Fe.

AB The precipitation of cementite prior to the precipitation of the
   strengthening M2C phase is investigated using two model ultra-high
   strength (UHS) steels. The structure, microstructure and chemical
   composition of cementite are studied by analytical electron microscopy
   techniques. The structure of cementite precipitated during early stages
   of tempering at 755 and 783 K was confirmed by convergent beam electron
   diffraction. In an alloy containing 0.16 mass% C, the cementite
   particles were primarily plate shaped and interlath type, whereas in an
   alloy containing 0.247 mass% C both inter- and intralath particles were
   observed. Consistent with the earlier studies on tempering of Fe-C
   martensite, lattice imaging of cementite suggests microsyntactic
   intergrowth of M5C2 (Hagg carbide). Quantification of the substitutional
   elements in cementite confirms its paraequilibrium state with ferrite at
   the very early stage of tempering. Computational thermodynamic and
   kinetic tools, Thermo-Cale and DICTRA (Diffusion controlled
   TRAnsformation) software. respectively. are used to model the
   precipitaton of paraequilibrium cementite in several multicomponent
   alloys. A thermodynamic model parameter describing the effect of Si on
   the stability of cementite is proposed. The model parameter is
   consistent with the following results: (a) that Si does not partition to
   cementite in Fe-Si-C and Co-Si-C alloys under orthoequilibrium
   conditions, and (b) there is a large driving force for the precipitation
   of paraequilibrium cementite in an Fe-0.41C-3Mn-2Si alloy where it has
   been experimentally verified. The nucleation driving forces for the
   precipitation of paraequilibrium cementite, and the two-phase (ferrite
   and cementite) paraequilibrium boundaries for multicomponent alloys are
   calculated using the Thero-Calc software systems. The results of growth
   simulations of cementite under paraequilibrium condition in
   multicomponent systems using the DICTRA software are also presented. (C)

AB A new database, for thermodynamic information for cemented carbides has
   been developed. A full description of the alloy system C-Co-N-Nb-Ta-Ti-W
   is presented. The work has involved both thermodynamic evaluations of
   lower order systems and experimental investigations. Full new
   assessments of the quaternary Ti-W-C-N, Ta-W-C-N, and Nb-W-C-N systems
   have been performed, including tests of the influence of model
   parameters on miscibility gaps in higher order systems. A new improved
   description of the Co-W-C system based on new experiments is used in the
   present work.
   The main results of the experimental work are
   measurements of the composition of the cubic carbide in selected
   equilibria;
   measurements of the temperatures of the liq + fcc + WC + gr. and liq +
   fcc + WC + M6C equilibria in the Co-W-C and Co-W-X-C (X = Ti, Ta, Nb)
   systems; and
   measurements of the solubility of Ti, Ta, and Nb in liquid in
   multicomponent alloys.
   The results of the assessments have been implemented into a new
   database. The database has successfully been used in a parallel project
   to simulate the formation of gamma -phase free zones in cemented
   carbides. A few other applications of industrial relevance are
   presented.

AB This paper deals with the formation and soft magnetic properties of
   Co(Fe)-M-B (M = transition Metals) glassy alloys in thin sheet and bulk
   ring forms prepared by single role melt spinning and copper mold casting
   methods. This multicomponent system was found to exhibit a distinct
   glass transition and a wide supercooled liquid region (DeltaT(x))
   exceeding 70 K before crystallization. The high thermal stability of the
   supercooled liquid has enabled us to produce the bulk glassy alloys. The
   Co-Fe-Ta-B alloy samples with a ring form of phi7 mm x phi3 mm, x t1 mm
   consist of a single glassy phase. These bulk amorphous samples exhibit
   excellent soft magnetic properties, which are nearly the same as those
   of the corresponding melt-spun glassy thin sheets: the coercivity (H-c)
   and saturation magnetic flux density (B-s) are 0.25 A/m and 0.49 T,
   respectively. These good soft magnetic properties suggest structural
   homogeneity resulting from its high glass-forming ability. The excellent
   soft magnetic properties are useful for industrial application.

AB Multi-component bulk Zr-based glassy alloys exhibit a wide supercooled
   liquid region, which provides excellent stability against
   crystallization. Microstructures consisting of a metallic glass matrix
   with crystallite precipitates of different shapes and sizes are
   synthesized. The compressive deformation behavior of metallic glassy
   matrices with and without second-phase precipitates is reviewed. At room
   temperature, fully amorphous alloys exhibit microplasticity without
   significant work hardening. In contrast, alloys with a large volume
   fraction of crystallites introduced either in dendritic form during
   casting or as nano-scaled precipitates during post-annealing of fully
   amorphous structures are brittle. At high temperatures, amorphous and
   partially crystalline alloys exhibit Newtonian viscous flow at low
   strain rates. At both temperatures the deformation behavior is described
   within the framework of the free volume model. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science

AB Atom-probe field-ion microscopy (APFIM) is used to study partitioning of
   the alloying elements between the gamma (FCC) and gamma' (L1(2)) phases
   and their segregation behavior at gamma/gamma' interfaces of a Rene N6
   nickel-based superalloy. The atomic-scale resolution and real space
   reconstruction capability for elemental chemical mapping makes
   three-dimensional atom-probe microscopy especially suitable for
   subnanoscale investigations of complex multicomponent superalloys.
   Concentration profiles of this alloy, obtained from an atom probe
   analysis, reveal the partitioning behavior of the alloying elements in
   Rene N6. As anticipated, the matrix strengtheners, such as Mo and W, are
   partitioned to the gamma (FCC) matrix, while Re segregates at the
   gamma/gamma' interfaces; the Gibbsian interfacial excess of Re is
   determined by both one-dimensional (2.32 atoms nm(-)2) and
   three-dimensional atom-probe microscopies (3.92 atoms nm(-)2) and the
   values obtained are in reasonable agreement.

   discussed. The selection rules for the chemical compositions appropriate
   for production of both amorphous and potentially shape memory alloys are
   proposed on a basis of well known three "golden rules" and statements
   regarding the shape memory phenomena. The production and
   characterisation of the "AB"-type series amorphous potentially shape
   memory alloys with "A"=(Ti,Hf,Zr), "B"=(Ni,Cu,Co,Ag,Pd,Al) and the "A:B"
   ratio varied as 45:55, 50:50 and 55:45 are discussed. The material
   structure was followed by X ray diffraction and the thermodynamic
   properties and thermal stability were studied by Differential Scanning
   Calorimetry. Various heat treatments regimes have been explored for the
   formation of appropriate microstructures to demonstrate the shape memory
   property.

AB A series of multicomponent Zr0.5Ti0.5Mn0.4V0.6Ni0.85M0.15 (M = Fe, Co,
   Cu, Mo, and AI) alloys are prepared and their crystal structure and
   pressure-composition-temperature curves are examined. The
   electrochemical properties of these alloys such as discharge capacity,
   cycling performance, and rate capability are also investigated.
   Zr0.5Ti0.5Mn0.4V0.6Ni0.85M0.15 (M = Fe, Co, Cu, Mo, and Al) alloys have
   predominantly C14 Laves phases multiple phase structure. The alloys with
   M = Co and Fe have relatively larger hydrogen storage capacities. The
   discharge capacities just after activation are relatively large in the
   case of the alloys with M = Co and Fe. They are 226 and 225 mAh/g,
   respectively, at the current density 60 mA/g. The
   Zr0.5Ti0.5Mn0.4V0.6Ni0.85Co0.15 alloy is the best one with a relatively
   large discharge capacity and good cycling performance. The gradual
   increases in the discharge capacities of the alloys with the increase in
   the current density (from 60 to 250 mA/g) are considered to result from
   the spontaneous hydrogen evolution due to an insufficient hydrogen
   overvoltage. During activation Ni-rich and Fe-rich regions form on the
   surface of the Zr0.5Ti0.5Mn0.4V0.6Ni0.85Fe0.15 alloy. They may act as
   active sites for the electrochemical reaction. With the increase in the
   number of charge/discharge cycles for the
   Zr0.5Ti0.5Mn0.4V0.6Ni0.85Fe0.15 alloy, the quantities of the zirconium
   and iron dissolved in the solution increase. (C) 2001 The

   Transformation) encompassing the components Al, C, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn,
   Mo, N, Nb, Ni, Pd, Re, Si, Ti, V,and W has been developed to calculate
   the driving force for martensitic transformation. Built upon the SSOL
   database of the Thermo-Gale software system, a large number of
   interaction parameters of the SSOL database have been modified, and many
   new interaction parameters, both binary and ternary, have been
   introduced to account for the heat of transformation, T, temperatures,
   and the composition dependence of magnetic properties. The critical
   driving force for face-centered cubic (fcc) --> body-centered cubic
   (bcc) heterogeneous martensitic nucleation in multicomponent alloys is
   modeled as the sum of a strain energy term, a defect-size-dependent
   interfacial energy term, and a composition-dependent interfacial work
   term. Using pur multicomponent thermodynamic database, a model for
   barrierless heterogeneous martensitic nucleation, a model far the
   composition and temperature dependence of the shear modulus, and a set
   of unique interfacial kinetic parameters, we have demonstrated the
   efficacy of predicting the fcc --> bcc martensitic start temperature
   (M-s) in multicomponent alloys with an accuracy of +/- 40 K over a very
   wide composition range.

AB Multicomponent Fe75-x-yCOxNiySi8B17 glassy alloys were found to exhibit
   a distinct grass transition, followed by a supercooled liquid region
   before crystallization in a rather wide composition range of 7.5 to 45
   at%Co and 7.5 to 60 at%Ni. The largest value of the supercooled liquid
   region defined by the difference between the glass transition
   temperature (Tg) and crystallization temperature (T-x), DeltaT(x) (=
   T-x- T-g) was 54 K for Fe30Co30Ni15Si8B17 Furthermore, the high reduced
   glass transition temperature (T-g/T-m) above 0.60 was obtained in the
   range of 15 to 30 at%Co and 37.5 to 52.5 at%Ni in the series of
   Fe75-x-yCoxNiySi8B17. The use of Fe30Co30Ni15Si8B17 with a large DeltaT,
   of 54 K and a high T-g/T-m of 0.65 enabled us to produce bulk glassy
   rods with diameters up to 1.2 mm. The T-g, T-x, saturated magnetization
   (4 pi I-s), and coercive force (H-cj) of the as-cast 1.2 mm rod alloy
   are 780 K, 834 K, 0.90 T, and 3.0 A/m, respectively In addition, the
   cast glassy rod exhibits Young's modulus of 110 GPa, compressive
   fracture strength of 2800 MPa and fracture elongation of 1.9%. It is
   noticed that the thermal stability, magnetic properties and mechanical
   properties are nearly the same as those for the melt-spun glassy ribbon.
   The first synthesis of Fe-Si-B base bulk grassy alloys with good soft
   magnetic properties and high mechanical strength is promising for the
   future development as a new type of engineering material.

   Initially, the starting powder material with mixed crystalline phases
   transformed into an almost single nanocrystalline supersaturated alpha
   -Fe phase after milling for 6 h. Subsequently, the milled powders became
   less crystalline and more amorphous with further increase in milling
   time. Co-free (Fe1-xNix)(70)Zr10B20 (x= 0.1, 0.2, 0.3) alloys and the
   Go-containing (Fe0.6Co0.1Ni0.3)(70)ZR(10)B(20) alloy tend to readily
   transform to amorphous structure after milling for 18 h. But Co-free
   (Fe1-xNix)(70)Zr10B20 (x = 0.3) alloy produced a mixture of
   nanocrystalline boron-rich phase and amorphous phase after milling for
   18 h. However, Go-containing (Fe0.6Co0.3Ni0.1)(70)Zr10B20 and
   (Fe0.8Co0.1Ni0.1)(70)Zr10B20 alloys with a low Ni/Co ratio failed to
   achieve amorphization even after 27 h. For all milled amorphous alloy
   powders, the glass transition temperatures, the onset crystallization
   temperatures lie in 544-577 and 579-619 K range, respectively. The
   supercooled liquid regions varied from 35 to 42 K, and the
   crystallization enthalpies varied from 3.2 to 6.9 kJ mol(-1) with a

   have been successfully synthesized by the diffusion method (DM). The
   characteristics of these alloys have been carefully investigated by
   means of XRD; PAT, PCT, EIS and measurement of electrochemical capacity.
   Experimental results show that the unit cell volume becomes larger and
   the point defect density increases strongly due to the diffusion of Zn.
   The presence of Zn decreases the desorption plateau and prevents losing
   the capacity to a certain degree at high discharge current density.
   Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) results show that the
   rate-determining step is the charge-transfer reaction on the
   alloy/electrolyte interface. The charge-transfer resistance of the
   electrode increases with increasing Zn concentration due to the
   formation of an oxide layer and the reduction of active sites on the
   electrode surface. So the concentration of Zn in the allay should be
   limited to below x=0.1. The Zn-free multicomponent AB(5) alloy has also

AB A methodology to simulate paraequilibrium (PE) growth in multicomponent
   systems using the DICTRA (Diffusion-Controlled Transformation) software
   is presented. For any given multicomponent system containing
   substitutional and interstitial elements, the basic approach is to
   define a hypothetical element Z, whose thermodynamic and mobility
   parameters are expressed in terms of the weighted average (with respect
   to site fraction) of the thermodynamic parameters and mobilities of the
   substitutional alloying elements. This procedure facilitates the
   calculation of PE phase diagrams and the PE growth simulations directly
   in the Thermo-Gale and DICTRA software, respectively. The results of two
   distinct case studies in multicomponent alloys are presented. In the
   first example, we simulate the isothermal growth of PE cementite in an
   Fe-C-Co-Cr-Mo-Ni secondary hardening steel during tempering. This is of
   practical importance in modeling the carbide precipitation kinetics
   during secondary hardening. In the second example, we have presented the
   results of PE ferrite growth during continuous cooling from an
   intercritical temperature in an Fe-Al-C-Mn-Si low-alloy steel. This is
   of importance to the design of triple-phase steels containing an
   austenite that has optimum stability, to facilitate stress-induced
   transformation under dynamic loading. The results of both simulations
   are in good accord with experimental results. The model calculations do
   not consider any resistive or dissipative forces, such as the
   interfacial energy, strain energy, or solute drag, and, as a result, the
   interface velocities represent an upper limit under the available
   chemical driving force.

AB Microstructure and solidification behavior in rapid quenching (i.e.,
   gas-atomized powders and melt-spun ribbons) of superalloy have been
   compared with bulk undercooled superalloy. The application of a molten
   salt denucleating technique combined with thermal cycle enables such
   investigation over a wide range of undercooling up to 210 K. The
   microstructure formation has been discussed for both methods of
   solidification with respect to undercooling, nucleation, and
   recalescence as well as recrystallization during post-recalescence.
   Comparison of the observed microstructure and morphologies indicates
   that the melt-spun ribbons and the gas-atomized powders with cooling
   rate above 10(4) K sec(-1) crystallize only after achieving a large
   degree of undercooling, which becomes higher and higher with the
   increase of cooling rate. Furthermore, it should be noted that, grain
   refinements, which play a decisive role in the undercooled as-solidified
   structure, however, result from different sources in the rapid quenching
   process. (C) 2001 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB Cemented carbide cutting tool inserts with a surface zone depleted of
   hard cubic carbides and enriched in ductile binder phase have been
   studied experimentally using scanning electron microscopy (SEM),
   electron probe micro analysis (EPMA) and transmission electron
   microscopy (TEM). The results are compared with simulations based on a
   solution of the multicomponent diffusion equations, coupled with
   calculations using thermodynamic descriptions of the individual phases.
   The materials in the study are based on WC-Ti(C,N)-Co, WC-Ti(C,N)-NbC-Co
   and WC-Ti(C,N)-TaC-Co. The surface zone is formed by creating a gradient
   in nitrogen activity in the material, leading to an outward diffusion of
   N. Due to thermodynamical coupling between N and Ti, the outward
   diffusion of N will lead to an inward diffusion of Ti, and a surface
   zone depleted in cubic carbides is formed. Additions of elements like Ta
   or Nb will affect the width of the surface zone. A material with a
   Ta-containing cubic phase will have a narrower surface zone than a
   material with a Nb-containing cubic phase. Ta or Nb additions also
   affect the distribution of the different phases in and adjacent to the
   surface zone. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Bulk nanostructured composite materials can be obtained by partial
   devitrification of slowly cooled bulk glass-forming multicomponent
   metallic glasses or by blending a glassy matrix alloy with insoluble
   second-phase particles by solid state processing. Their properties are
   discussed with respect to the effect of the second phases on the thermal
   stability and on the mechanical properties at room temperature as well
   as at temperatures around the glass-transition temperature, T-g.
   Microhardness measurements at room temperatures reveal a substantial
   increase in the hardness of the composites because of the uniform
   distribution of nanoscale particles in the glossy matrix. Also, there is
   a significant increase in yield strength with increasing volume fraction
   of particles. At elevated temperatures around T-g volume fractions of up
   to 40 vol-% of nanoscaled particles yield no significant change in
   strength as compared with the particle-free material, but the
   deformation behavior of the composites is mainly controlled by the
   Newtonian viscous flow of the glassy matrix phase. This easy-flow
   behavior opens a promising route for shaping complex parts of bulk
   nanostructured composites derived from metallic glasses at moderate
   temperatures and high strain rates.

AB High speed steels are ferrous based alloys of the Fe-C-X multicomponent
   system where X represents a group of alloying elements comprising mainly
   Cr, W or Mo, V, and Co. These steels are mainly used for cutting tools,
   since they are characterised by their capacity to retain a high level of
   hardness while cutting metals at high speed. The as cast microstructure
   of high speed steels consists of dendrites surrounded by a more or less
   continuous interdendritic network of eutectic carbides. These are
   observed even under rapid cooling, at rates as high as 10(6) K s(-1).
   The main features of the as cast microstructure are the distribution and
   morphology of eutectic carbides, owing to their decisive influence on
   mechanical properties, and on the service performance of the high speed
   steels, even after hot working. Hence, the most important improvements
   on the as cast microstructure that have been obtained through progress
   in alloy design concern the type, morphology, and volume fraction of the
   eutectic carbides, while improvements obtained by progress in
   solidification processing are, on the other hand, mostly related to a
   significant reduction in the microstructure scale. The development of
   the microstructure in high speed steels through solidification is
   reviewed, emphasising the effects of the alloy chemical composition and
   of the cooling rate. The formation of the eutectic carbides and the
   techniques used to control their morphology and distribution, both under
   normal and rapid cooling, are discussed. Microstructures obtained
   through surface remelting and surface alloying using laser and electron
   beams are described, and the application of highly alloyed high speed
   steels to the manufacture of cast hot rolling mill rolls is reviewed.

   electron beam melting (EBM) allow to restore the ISO performance
   characteristics especially inert in the biological ambiance, at cobalt
   scrap alloys remelting. This can by realized in a way: (1) high
   -temperature dissociation of nonmetallic inclusions (Al2O3, SiO2, TiO,
   CrxO(3), ...) by reactions: MexOy = x[MeO] + (y)/O-2(2), and creation of
   the conditions for the products of decomposition remove from molten
   metal; (2) a dissociation reaction acceleration by entering an active
   agent-deoxidize carbon. [MexOy] + y[C] = x[Me] = y CO; (3) chemical
   composition homogenization as a result of intense molten metal stirring
   in crucible. The additional alloying and obtaining of cast branded bars
   are fulfilled by means of repeated remelting in the vacuum-induction
   furnace with following ceramic mold casting, The submitted technological
   scheme permitted to restore the items compiled with ISO standard which
   used in implantation surgery and in the dentistry from scraps.

AB New multicomponent alloys of the 'AB' and Be-'AB'-Y type general series
   with the constituent alloy components varied as 'A'= (Ti, Zr, Nb, Hf)
   and 'B'= (Ni, Cu, Co, Pd, Ag, Al), which are essentially the potential
   shape memory alloys, have been developed in initially amorphous state by
   means of the rapid solidification techniques in CECM/CNRS, Vitry and
   IMPh, N.A.S.U., Kyyiv. Initially bulk amorphous state is needed as the
   precursor for production of nanostructured materials of the complicated
   shape and dimension like wires, tubes or sheets. The main objects of
   this study are mainly TiNi-based shape memory alloys including, first of
   all, TiNiCu-, TiNiZr- and TiNiHf-based alloy systems which were already
   found amorphous in the melt-spun condition. We start with well-known
   ternary Ti32Hf18Ni50, Ti32Zr18Ni50 and Ti50Ni25Cu25 alloy compositions
   which undergo the reversible martensite transformation with the Af
   temperature equal to similar to + 256 degreesC, similar to + 150
   degreesC and similar to + 90 degreesC, respectively, The material
   structure was controlled by the XRD and TEM/SAD techniques, while the
   thermodynamic properties were studied by means of DSC measurements. The
   thermodynamic parameters like the glass transition temperature T-G, the
   crystallization temperature T-X (and derivative the glass formation
   ability DeltaT equivalent to [T-X-T-G] and T-G/T-M ratio) and
   crystallization heat DeltaH(X) have been studied versus composition
   variation.

AB The 'AB' and Be-'AB'-Y transition metal compound melt-spun ribbons have
   been produced both in IMPh, N.A.S.U., Kyylv and CECM CNRS, Vitry, where
   'A'= (Ti, Zr, Nb, Hf) and 'B' = (Ni, Cu, Co, Pd, Ag, Al). The simple
   crystallization step (SCS) in the continuous heating regime
   {(-150-+50)degreesC --> --> (570-600)degreesC, 1 min} has been used for
   transformation of the amorphous ribbon into the crystalline state and
   thermodynamic property measurement. Very often, the SCS is not enough
   for the restoration of the shape memory property of the multicomponent
   alloys in the initially bulk amorphous state and various heat treatment
   regimes should be used. The heat treatment regimes chosen for the
   crystallization and microstructure formation are discussed. Specific
   temperatures obtained from typical variation of the heat flow from
   amorphous ribbons during the first heating run in the DSC camera zip to
   600 degreesC were taken into account, The chemical composition of some
   developed multicomponent alloys varies around the 'deep eutectic'
   composition range and, so, their melting temperature may be sharply
   decreased. This factor is also to be taken into account for defining of
   the upper temperature limit for the heat treatment regimes. The
   crystallization process during the isothermal pre-annealing at T-A<T-X
   (T-A-annealing temperature, Tx-crystallization temperature) is not
   complete one: usually the state after such treatment is the mixture of
   the fine nanocrystalline and retained amorphous structure. Similar to
   some observations made on other bulk amorphous alloy systems, the
   partial crystallization during preannealing at T-G<T-A<T-X does not
   cause the stabilization of the retained amorphous structure component
   (T-G-the glass transition temperature). Annealing at high temperatures,
   T-A>T-X, is oriented on production of a pure beta phase (probably, with
   some amount of the Ti2Ni-type particles) with varied mean grain size by
   progressive tempering (0.5 hr, 3 hrs up to 20 hrs).

AB Dissolution of stoichiometric multi-component particles is an important
   process occurring during the heat treatment of as-cast aluminum alloys
   prior to hot extrusion. A mathematical model is proposed to describe
   such a process. In this model equations are given to determine the
   position of the particle interface in time, using a number of diffusion
   equations which are coupled by nonlinear boundary conditions at the
   interface. This problem is known as a vector valued Stefan problem. A
   necessary condition for existence of a solution of the moving boundary
   problem is proposed and investigated using the maximum principle for the
   parabolic partial differential equation. Furthermore, for an unbounded
   domain and planar co-ordinates an asymptotic approximation based on
   self-similarity is derived. The asymptotic approximation is used to gain
   insight into the influence of all components on the dissolution.
   Subsequently, a numerical treatment of the vector valued Stefan problem
   is described. The numerical solution is compared with solutions obtained
   by the analytical methods. Finally, an example is shown. (C) 2000

AB The characteristics of the Ni/MH battery, including discharge voltage,
   high-rate discharge capability and charge/ discharge cycle lifetime are
   mainly determined by the construction of the negative and positive
   electrodes and the composition of the hydrogen-absorbing alloy. The
   metal hydride (MH) alloy powder for the negative electrode of the Ni/MH
   battery was first pulverized and oxidized by electrochemically
   charging/discharging for a number of cycles. A multicomponent ABS-based
   alloy Mm(0.95)Ti(0.05)Ni(3.85)Co(0.45)Mn(0.35)Al(0.35) was developed as
   the hydrogen-absorbing alloy. The discharge characteristics of the

   exchange current density, were studied by means of the electrochemical
   experiments and analysis in the experimental cell. The polarization
   measurements show that the exchange current density of the MH electrode

   almost remains constant after 30 cycles. A microcracking activation,
   resulting from an increase in reaction surface area and an improvement
   in the electrode surface activation, decreases the polarization
   resistance and increases the hydrogen exchange current densities.

AB Bulk metallic materials have ordinarily been produced:by melting and
   solidification processes for the last several thousand years. However,
   metallic liquid is unstable at temperatures below the melting
   temperature and solidifies immediately into crystalline phases.
   Consequently, all bulk engineering alloys are composed of a crystalline
   structure. Recently, this common concept was exploded by the findings of
   the stabilization phenomenon of the supercooled liquid for a number of
   alloys in the Mg-, lanthanide-, Zr-, Ti-, Fe-, Co-, Pd-Cu- and Ni-based
   systems. The alloys with the stabilized, supercooled liquid state have
   three features in their alloy components, i.e. multicomponent systems,
   significant atomic size ratios above 12%, and negative heats of mixing.
   The stabilization mechanism has also been investigated from experimental
   data of structure analyses and fundamental physical properties. The
   stabilization has enabled the production of bulk amorphous alloys in the
   thickness range of 1-100 mm by using various casting processes. Bulk
   amorphous Zr-based alloys exhibit high mechanical strength, high
   fracture toughness and good corrosion resistance and have been used for
   sporting goods materials. The stabilization also leads to the appearance
   of a large supercooled liquid region before crystallization and enables
   high-strain rate super-plasticity through Newtonian flow. The new Fe-
   and Go-based amorphous alloys exhibit a large super-cooled liquid region
   and good soft magnetic properties which are characterized by low
   coercive force and high permeability. Furthermore, homogeneous
   dispersion of nanoscale -particles into Zr-based bulk amorphous alloys
   was found to cause an improvement of tensile strength without detriment
   to good ductility. The discovery of the stabilization phenomenon,
   followed by the clarification of the stabilization criteria of the
   supercooled liquid, will promise the future definite development of bulk
   amorphous alloys as new basic science and engineering materials. (C)

AB The method of phase physicochemical analysis is used to study martensite
   steels in the Fe - Cr-Ni Co - Mo - W - V - C system. It is shown that
   the chemical compositions of two multicomponent phases, i.e., hardened
   martensite and (Cr; hl)(23)C-6 carbide segregated from it in
   high-temperature tempering are correlated where the concentrations of
   the elements Mo/W, V/W and (Cr + V)I(Mo + W) are concerned. The
   discovered correlation is used for developing a method for calculating
   the chemical composition of a (Cr, Fe, Co, Ni, Mo, W, V)(23)C-6 carbide
   with the help of the concentrations of the elements in the alpha-solid
   solution and the differences in the atomic radii. It is shown that the
   alloying elements in the carbide substitute for chromium in
   correspondence with the principle of dimension. It is inferred that the
   type of bonding in the chromium sublattice in the carbide is metallic.

AB The solidification behavior and resultant solidification cracking
   susceptibility of autogenous gas tungsten are fusion welds in Alloy
   HR-160(R) was investigated by Varestraint testing, differential thermal
   analysis and various microstructural characterization techniques. The
   alloy exhibited a liquidus temperature of 1387 degrees C and initiated
   solidification by a primary L --> gamma reaction in which Ni, Si and Ti
   segregated to the interdendritic liquid and cosegregated to the gamma
   dendrite cores. Chromium exhibited no preference for segregation to the
   solid or liquid phase during solidification. Solidification terminated
   at approximate to 1162 degrees C by a eutectic-type L --> [gamma+
   (Ni,Co)(16)(Ti,Cr)(6)Si-7] reaction. The (Ni,Co)(16)(Ti,Cr)(6)Si-7 phase
   is found to be analogous to the G phase that forms in the Ni-Ti-Si and
   Co-Ti-Si ternary systems, and similarities are found between the
   solidification behavior of this commercial multicomponent alloy and the
   simple Ni-Si and Ni-Ti binary systems. Reasonable agreement is obtained
   between the calculated and measured volume percent of the
   [gamma+(Ni,Co)(16)(Ti,Cr)(6)Si-7] eutectic-type constituent with the
   Scheil equation using experimentally determined k values for Si and Ti
   from electron microprobe data. The alloy exhibited a very high
   susceptibility to solidification cracking in the Varestraint test. This
   is attributed to a large solidification temperature range of 225 degrees
   C and the presence of 2-5 vol-% solute-rich interdendritic liquid that
   preferentially wets the grain boundaries and interdendritic regions.

AB A new device for generation of vapor of solid precursor(s) for the
   Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) process has been designed and tested.
   Powder of the precursor(s) is kept at room temperature in an inert
   atmosphere during the deposition and steadily delivered by small
   portions into an evaporator. Small beads of an inert material are added
   to the powder in order to dilute the mixture and make the slow powder
   delivery process more reliable. Flash-evaporation of the precursor(s)
   from the beads' surface assures controlled and constant in-time
   composition of the precursor(s) vapor. This facilitates the use of
   temperature unstable precursors. Simultaneous evaporation of several
   precursors allows multicomponent films to be easily grown. This process
   is especially suitable for use of precursors with a big difference in
   sublimation/evaporation temperatures. The feeder was tested during the
   CVD of nickel, copper, cobalt, and copper-cobalt thin films. These films
   were: deposited from nickel(II) bisdiethylglyoximate, copper(II)
   bisdipivaloylmethanate, cobalt(II) bisacetylacetoniminate, and
   cobalt(II) bis-3,5-dimethylpyrazolylborate complexes. The conditions
   were optimized for the film growing processes in each case. All films
   were characterized by X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy, X-ray
   Diffraction and Scanning Electron Microscopy.

AB In order to tailor novel alloys resistant to high temperature corrosion
   in multicomponent sulfidizing-oxidizing environments, amorphous or
   nanocrystalline Al-refractory metal alloys with and without silicon and
   Cr-refractory metal alloys have been prepared by sputter deposition. The
   sulfidation and oxidation behavior of the alloys has been studied as a
   function of temperature in sulfur vapor pressure of 10(3) Pa and in
   oxygen of 2 x 10(4) Pa, respectively. The sulfidation of these alloys
   generally follows a parabolic rate law, being thus diffusion controlled.
   The sulfidation rates of Al-refractory metal and Cr-refractory metal
   alloys are several orders of magnitude lower than those of conventional
   high temperature alloys and comparable to or even lower than those of
   the corresponding refractory metals. The sulfide scales formed on these
   alloys consist of two layers, comprising an outer Al2S3 or Cr2S3 layer
   and an inner refractory metal disulfide layer. The formation of the
   inner layer is attributed to the excellent sulfidation resistance of
   these alloys. The oxidation resistance of Al-refractory metal alloys is
   not sufficiently high, but the addition of silicon improves remarkably
   their oxidation resistance by synergistic effect of aluminum and
   silicon. Although the Cr-Mo alloys possess poor oxidation resistance,
   due to the formation of volatile molybdenum oxide, the oxidation
   resistance of the Cr-Nb and Cr-Ta alloys is as high as that of typical
   chromia-forming alloys. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights

AB The metal hydride (MH) alloy powder for the negative electrode of the
   Ni/MH battery was first pulverized and oxidized by electrochemically
   charging and discharging for a number of cycles. The plate of the
   negative electrode of an experimental cell in this study was made from a
   mixture of a multicomponent AB(5)-based alloy powder, nickel powder, and
   polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). The characteristics of the negative
   electrode, including discharge capacity, exchange current density, and
   hydrogen diffusivity, were studied by means of the electrochemical
   experiments and analysis in an experimental cell. The exchange current
   density of a Mm(0.95)Ti(0.05)Ni3.85Co(0.45)Mn(0.35)Al(0.35) alloy
   electrode increases with increasing number of charge/discharge cycles
   and then remains almost constant after 20 cycles. A microcracking

AB In a D-T fusion reactor tritium exists together with other hydrogen
   isotopes. However, the permeation of multicomponent hydrogen isotopes
   through austenitic stainless steels has not been discussed so far. In
   this paper the permeation behavior of hydrogen isotopes through type 304
   and 316 austenitic stainless steels was investigated by the co-current
   double tube method in the temperature range of 623-973 K. The
   permeabilities of hydrogen observed in this study gave close agreement
   with the recommended value by Le Claire. Discrepancies in reported
   values for the permeabilities of deuterium are larger than those of
   hydrogen and there has been no recommended value of permeability. The
   permeabilities of deuterium were obtained using the same apparatus and
   the same technique as hydrogen experiments. The isotope effect ratio in
   permeation for 316SS was smaller than that for 304SS. The permeation
   behavior of hydrogen isotopes in the binary-component hydrogen isotopes
   system was also observed under various conditions and compared with the
   values from the model calculation. It is concluded in this study that
   the separation factor in permeation through austenitic stainless steels
   coincides with the isotope effect ratio in permeation. (C) 1999 Elsevier

AB Blends of polystyrene and polyethylene (PS/PE), including blends in
   which a styrene/ethyrene-butylene/styrene (SEBS) terpolymer was employed
   as a compatibilizer, were studied. Their rheology showed that the effect
   of the addition of SEES to PS/PE blends was strongly affected by the
   blend composition and the shear rates involved in the blending and
   post-forming processes. The addition of PE to PS led to a reduction of
   fracture toughness compared with that of PS. This effect was attributed
   to the fine minor phase morphology of the blends obtained after
   extrusion blending and injection molding. The fatigue crack propagation
   (FCP) results showed that the fatigue crack growth rates were
   significantly reduced at low and moderate range of stress intensity
   factor (Delta K) by the presence of PE. Performance was enhanced when
   SEES was present. The results also showed that both the fracture
   toughness and the FCP behavior of the blends were strongly dependent on
   the loading direction, the minor phase morphology, the composition of
   the blend, and, to a lesser degree, the presence of a compatibilizer.
   This study demonstrates that the fracture toughness and the FCP
   performance of such polymer blends can vary inversely.

   have no significant effect on the refractive index of the silica-titania
   (80 : 20 mol%) matrix. The Er3+ fluorescence emission was flat within
   +/-0.5 dB, between 1520 and 1560 nm. The corresponding I-4(13/2)
   metastable level lifetime was found to decrease from 6.1 to 3.5 ms, as
   the Er concentration increased from 0.1 to 0.5 at.%, for films co-doped
   with 0.5 at.% Yb and 10 at.% Al and the fluorescence decay was
   essentially single exponential below a Er quenching concentration of 0.5
   at.% (1.1 x 1020 ions/cm(3)). The lifetime appears to be limited by
   Er-Er interactions at higher rare-earth ion concentrations and by
   residual OH species in the sol-gel derived waveguides. Vacuum heat
   treatment at a temperature near 570 degrees C was somewhat effective in
   increasing the Er fluorescence lifetime, whereas reactive atmosphere
   processing in CCl4 or Cl-2 at a similar temperature appeared to be less
   effective.

AB The Zr-V-Ni system multicomponent alloys were investigated by
   electrochemical measurements, X-ray diffraction analysis, scanning
   electron microscopy, and energy-dispersive spectroscopy At room
   temperature, the discharge capacity of ZrVxMn0.9-xNi1.1 (x = 0.1-0.8)
   alloys remains at a high level when x = 0.3-0.5. A C15 main phase alloy
   has good capacity. ZrV0.5Mn0.3T0.1Ni1.1 (T = Ni, Co, Fe, or Al) alloys
   exhibit lower discharge ability at room temperature because higher
   contents of V and Mn (i.e., (V + Mn)/AB(2) = 0.8) form more stable
   hydrides. Al substitution also stabilizes the hydrides effectively. All
   these alloys have discharge capacities of about 350 mAh g(-1) on heating
   to 328 K. Our further investigation showed that the substitution of Ti
   for Zr decreases markedly the thermodynamic stability of the hydrides
   and promotes a promising discharge capacity at room temperature. During
   cycling, the preferential anodic oxidation of some components, such as
   Ti and V, degrades the reversible storage ability. An electrochemical
   method was adopted to evaluate the PcT isotherm for Zr-based alloys.
   This method is suitable for all hydride electrodes as well. (C) 1999 The

AB The kinetics of the formation of the sigma phase in the high strength
   nickel-based superalloys UDIMET 720 (U720) and UDIMET 720Li (U720Li)
   have been characterized using a combination of electrolytic extraction
   and quantitative X-ray diffraction (XRD) involving the Rietveld method.
   In order to perform the analysis, a database of crystallographic
   parameters is required and details of this are presented. It is shown
   that the numerical data generated using this technique are consistent
   with observations made using conventional optical, scanning, and
   transmission electron microscopies. The results are presented in the
   form of temperature-time-transformation (TTT) diagrams. It appears that
   U720Li is very much less prone to sigma precipitation than U720. The
   presence of a tensile stress accelerates the reaction, but the kinetics
   are very slow at temperatures lower than 700 degrees C. Thermodynamic
   calculations have been used in order to infer that the formation of
   sigma is associated predominantly with the dissolution of the gamma
   matrix. Theoretical modeling of sigma formation is carried out using a
   coupled thermodynamic/kinetic analysis assuming multicomponent
   diffusion-controlled growth. The numerical results are broadly
   consistent with the experimental data; in the U720Li alloy, there
   appears to be an incubation period associated with the onset of
   reaction, but this is negligible in U720. In principle, the method could
   be adapted for the quantification of microstructural instabilities in
   other superalloys. If a maximum tolerable amount of microstructural
   degradation is defined, the method provides a rational basis for the
   estimation of the limiting combinations of temperature, time, and stress
   that any given alloy can withstand.

   surface layer about 2-2.5 nm of both alloys, the main part of nickel
   atoms an in metallic state (Ni-0) and only a third of them in oxidized
   state (Ni+2, Ni+3). At the same time the concentration of nickel in
   surface layer of Zr-containing alloy is much lower as compared with
   Mm-containing alloy. The chemical state of Co and V atoms is similar to
   Ni atoms state, but their concentrations, especially of V, in surface
   layer is lower than that of nickel. The results of XPS have been
   compared with those of transmission electron microscopy of the thin
   foils of La- and Zr- based alloys. Dark field microphotographs of the
   oxidized alloys indicate presence of two different phases, which,
   according to electron microdiffraction, are nickel-based alloy and
   oxide. On the first stage of oxidation on the surface of foil the fine
   nickel particles (about 10 nm) and amorphous oxide phase appear.
   Complete oxidation of the foil leads to formation of eutectic-like
   structure of mixture of metallic and oxide phase. Some difference of the
   oxidized layer structure of investigated alloys have been observed. (C)

AB Calculated multicomponent phase diagrams were used to identify high
   speed steel (HSS) type alloys having the potential to exhibit enhanced
   sinterability. The requirement was for an extensive austenite + carbide
   $ liquid phase field. Of the six tungsten and molybdenum based systems
   studied, Fe-14Mo-C + 4Cr-8Co systems were potentially the most
   promising. Appropriate compositions were water atomised and additional
   alloys prepared by blending annealed powders with graphite powders.
   Powders were compacted to green densities of about 70% theoretical and
   then vacuum sintered. Sinterability was assessed in terms of sintered
   densities and microstructures. Alloys containing Fe-13Mo-1.3C,
   Fe-14Mo-4Cr-1.3C, and Fe-14Mo8Co-4Cr-1.4C were sintered to full density
   at temperatures as low as 1170 degrees C, 70-150K lower than for
   existing HSSs. Sintering windows were 20-30 K, a significant improvement
   on existing HSSs. As sintered microstructures consisted of angular M6C
   carbides dispersed in martensitic matrixes, which is typical for
   correctly sintered HSS. Heat treatment response and cutting performance
   for the sinterable grades were assessed and found to be comparable to
   existing HSS. The cutting performance of Fe-14Mo-8Co-4Cr-1.4C tools at
   45 and 52.5 m min(-1) was superior to both cast wrought M2 and T1 tools
   of identical geometry. Lower carbon contents resulted in an increase in
   sintering temperature and a reduction in the width of the sintering
   window. Higher carbon contents destroyed sinterability, since they led
   to the formation of M2C eutectic structures in the undersintered
   condition. Alloy sinterability was correlated to differential thermal
   analysis data obtained during heating of powders. The variations in
   sinterability with alloy composition are discussed with reference to
   phase diagrams; the degradation in sinterability observed at carbon
   contents above 1.4% is attributed to the presence of ternary eutectic
   phase fields. The commercial implications of the relationship between
   sinterability and alloy composition are discussed.

   investigated as a negative electrode in the metal hydride batteries. The

   cobalt from a cubic C15 type structure to a hexagonal C14 type
   structure. There were anomalies in the relation among the hydrogen
   plateau pressure from PCT, electro nic factor of the alloy and A(2)B(2)
   tetrahedral interstice for hydrogen occupation. The
   Zr(V0.2Mn0.2Ni0.5Co0.1)(2.4) electrode was used to evaluate the

AB This article reviews our recent results on the development of
   ferromagnetic bulk amorphous alloys prepared by casting processes. The
   multicomponent Fe-(Al,Ga)-(P,C,B,Si) alloys are amorphized in the bulk
   form with diameters up to 2 mm, and the temperature interval of the
   supercooled liquid region before crystallization is in the range of 50
   to 67 K. These bulk amorphous alloys exhibit good soft magnetic
   properties, i.e., high B-s of 1.1 to 1.2 T, low H-c of 2 to 6 A/m, and
   high mu(e) of about 7000 at 1 kHz. The Nd-Fe-Al and Pr-Fe-Al bulk
   amorphous alloys are also produced in the diameter range of up to 12 mm
   by the copper mold casting process and exhibit rather good hard magnetic
   properties, i.e., B-r of about 0.1 T, high H-c of 300 to 400 kA/m, and
   rather high (JH)(max) of 13 to 20 kJ/m(3). The crystallization causes
   the disappearance of the hard magnetic properties. Furthermore, the
   melt-spun Nd-Fe-Al and Pr-Fe-Al alloy ribbons exhibit soft-type magnetic
   properties. Consequently, the hard magnetic properties are concluded to
   be obtained only for the bulk amorphous alloys. The bulk Nd-Fe-Al and
   Pr-Fe-Al amorphous alloys have an extremely high T-x/T-m, of about 0.90
   and a small Delta T-m (= T-m - T-x) of less than 100 K and, hence, their
   large glass-forming ability is due to the steep increase in viscosity in
   the supercooled liquid state. The high T-x/T-m enables the development
   of a fully relaxed, clustered amorphous structure including Nd-Nd and
   Nd-Fe atomic pairs. It is, therefore, presumed that the hard magnetic
   properties are due to the development of Nd-Nd and Nd-Fe atomic pairs
   with large random magnetic anisotropy. The Nd- and Pr-based bulk
   amorphous alloys can be regarded as a new type of clustered amorphous
   material, and the control of the clustered amorphous structure is
   expected to enable the appearance of novel functional properties which
   cannot be obtained for an ordinary amorphous structure.

AB This review deals with our recent development of Fe-based bulk amorphous
   alloys with soft magnetic properties. Multicomponent
   Fe-(Al,Ga)-(P,C,B,Si) and Fe-(Co,Ni)-(Zr,Nb,Ta)-B alloys are amorphized
   in the bulk form with diameters up to 2 and 6 mm, respectively, by
   copper mold casting and the largest temperature interval of the
   supercooled liquid region before crystallization is 67 and 88 K,
   respectively. These bulk amorphous alloys exhibit good soft magnetic
   properties, i.e., high saturation magnetization (I-s) of 1.1 to 1.2 T
   and low coercivity (H-c) of 2 to 6 A/m. The saturated magnetostriction
   (lambda(s)) and Curie temperature (T-c) are in the range of 20-30X10(-6)
   and 580-605 K, respectively, for the former system and 10-14X10(-6) and
   447-594 K, respectively, for the latter system. The effective
   permeability (mu(e)) at 1 kHz is 7000-15000 for the
   Fe-(Al,Ga)-(P,C,B,Si) amorphous ribbons and 15000-25000 for the
   Fe-(Co,Ni)-(Zr,Nb)-B amorphous ribbons. In comparison with Fe-Si-B
   amorphous ribbons, it is characterized that the present alloys have
   lower H-c and higher mu(e) resulting from lower lambda(s). The easy
   formation of bulk Fe-based amorphous alloys with good soft magnetic
   properties indicates the possibility of future development as a new type
   of soft magnetic material.

AB Evolution processes proceeding in the course of solidification of
   single-and multi-components melts in heterogeneous systems are
   investigated. A set of equations describing the kinetics of the
   crystallization process during removal of heat from boundary of the
   system is derived and solved. As a result of solution of the system, the
   equation for motion of a new phase crust, the distribution function for
   disperse particles in terms of their size and composition and a law of
   variation in the mean radius of disperse particles in space are
   obtained. It is shown that during crystallization of a multi-phase and
   multicomponent melt under nonuniform conditions the phase composition of
   an final sample can differ in its various points. General equations
   describing the phase co-existence region are derived. (C) 1998 Elsevier

AB A new Fe-based amorphous alloy exhibiting the glass transition and
   supercooled liquid region before crystallization was searched in the
   composition range of Fe63Co7N10-xZrxB20 (x=0 to 6 at%). The amorphous
   alloys containing 4 to 6 at%Zr were found to exhibit the glass
   transition, followed by a supercooled liquid region. The crystallization
   from the supercooled liquid of the 4%Zr alloy occurred through three
   stages of Am-->Am'+Fe3B-->Am'+Fe3B+gamma-Fe+
   Nd2Fe23B3+Fe2Zr+Fe3Zr-->alpha-Fe+Fe2Zr+Fe3Zr+Nd2Fe14B+Fe2B+ZrB2. In the
   crystallized stare, the 4% and 6%Zr alloys exhibited hard magnetic
   properties, i.e., saturation magnetization of 1.15 to 1.18 T, remanence
   of 0.75 to 0.76 T, coercive force of 30 to 58 kA/m and maximum energy
   product of 7.8 to 13 kJ/m(3). The grain sizes of the alpha-Fe and
   Nd2Fe14B phases for the 4%Zr alloy subjected to optimum annealing were
   about 45 and 25 nm, respectively. The fine mixed structure was thought
   to reveal the hard magnetic properties by the exchange magnetic coupling
   mechanism even in the coexistent state with Fe2Zr, Fe3Zr, Fe2B and ZrB2.
   The appearance of the glass transition also implies that the 4%Zr and
   6%Zr alloys have a high glass-forming ability leading to the formation
   of a bulk amorphous alloy. The finding that the amorphous alloys
   exhibited the glass transition in the as-quenched state and the hard
   magnetic properties in the crystallized state is important, because the
   direct production of a bulk hard magnetic alloy by a simple process is
   expected, such as the crystallization of the cast bulk amorphous alloy.

AB The formation and growth characteristics of Fe based aluminide diffusion
   layers at the Fe-Al interface have been analysed in terms of interfacial
   interaction potentials based on the statistico-thermodynamical theory of
   multicomponent alloys combined with electronic theory in the
   pseudopotential approximation. The pairwise interatomic interaction
   potentials and partial ordering energies have been calculated to predict
   the effect of various alloying additions on the activity coefficient of
   Al atoms in alpha-Fe-(0.95)(Al(1-n)X(n))(0.05) alloys where X = Si, Ti,
   Ge, Sb, Mg, Cu, Ca, Ag, Cd, Cr, Co, Zn, Mn, Ni, Pb or Bi and considered
   up to 1 at.%. The results of calculation show that the impurity elements
   with regard to their effect on the activity coefficient of Al atoms may
   be classified into two groups; I-group impurity elements, X(I)=Si, Ti,
   Ge, Sb, Mg, Cu, Ca, Ag, Cd, and Cr which decrease the activity
   coefficient of Al atoms, reduce the thickness of the Fe-Al intermetallic
   diffusion layer and II-group impurity elements, X(II) = Co, Zn, Mn, Ni,
   Pb and Bi, which increase the activity coefficient of Al atoms, tend to
   increase the thickness of diffusion layer at the Fe-Al interface. It has
   been established, in agreement with experimental observation, that the
   value of activity coefficient of Al atoms in
   alpha-Fe(0.95)(Al(1-n)X(n))(0.05) alloys has a strong influence on the
   formation and growth kinetics of interfacial diffusion layers at the
   Fe-AL interface. The analysis of the effects of type and content of X(I)
   and X(II) impurity elements on the activity coefficients of Al
   gamma(Al)/gamma(Al)(0), in alpha-Fe(0.95)(Al(1-n)X(n))(0.05) alloys is
   in good qualitative agreement with the experimental results reported in
   the literature. (C) 1998 Acta Metallurgica Inc.

AB Bulk amorphous alloys with thicknesses up to 75 mm and a wide
   supercooled liquid region reaching 127 K before crystallization have
   been found to be fabricated in a number of multicomponent systems which
   satisfy the three empirical rules for the achievement of large
   glass-forming ability, i.e., (1) multicomponent alloy systems consisting
   of more than three constituent elements, (2) significantly different
   atomic size ratios above 12 % among the main constituent elements, and
   (3) negative heats of mixing among their elements. The scientific
   significance of the three empirical rules has been proved based on a
   number of experimental data as well as on the kinetic theories of the
   nucleation and growth of a crystalline phase. By choosing appropriate
   compositions which satisfy the three empirical rules, bulk amorphous
   alloys in Mg-, lanthanide metal-, Zr-, Pd-, Fe- and Co-based systems
   were produced in cylindrical and sheet forms by various solidification
   processes. The bulk amorphous alloys exhibit high tensile strength, good
   ductility, high elastic energy, high impact fracture energy and high
   corrosion resistance for Zr-based system and good soft magnetic
   properties for Fe-based system. Furthermore, their bulk amorphous alloys
   heated in the supercooled liquid region can be deformed into various
   shapes by viscous flow. The ideal Newtonian flow has been achieved in
   the supercooled liquid. The utilization of the ideal superplasticity
   enabled the achievement of an extremely large elongation exceeding 15000
   %. These excellent data allow us to expect that the bulk amorphous
   alloys with a wide thickness range up to 75 mm develop as a new type of
   engineering material.

AB A three chamber ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) surface analysis system combined
   with high pressure reaction cells has been designed. It can be used for
   the preparation and characterization of ordered metal oxide model
   catalyst surfaces and for the investigation of heterogeneous catalytic
   reactions there on also under high pressures. The reaction cells are
   completely separated from the UHV analysis chambers. They can be used
   for oxidation treatments and reaction studies at total pressures up to 1
   bar. A new sample transfer mechanism together with sapphire sample
   holders and sample heating-cooling stations on the analysis chamber
   manipulators provides electron beam and resistive sample heating, liquid
   nitrogen sample cooling, and precise thermocouple temperature control.
   First experimental results obtained on single crystalline iron oxide
   dehydrogenation films grown onto Pt(lll) substrates are presented. These
   results demonstrate the capability of the system for in situ
   investigation of a sample surface using scanning tunneling microscopy,
   low-energy electron diffraction, Auger electron spectroscopy,
   photoelectron emission microscopy, and temperature programmed desorption
   before and after catalytic reactions at high pressures. This single
   crystal surface science approach provides new insight into the atomic
   scale surface chemistry of metal oxides under real catalysis conditions.

AB Coating have been produced by bias activated reactive evaporation method
   (BARE) [1] on polished HSS steel and Coming glass substrates. Titanium
   and molybdenum were co-evaporated using a special two-hearth electron
   gun with separate Ti and Mo evaporation sources. Various chemical
   compositions were obtained by means of heating time control of
   respective materials. The working gases were nitrogen, acetylene and a
   1:1 mixture of both. The investigation of properties of layers with
   various chemical compositions covered samples: TiC, TiCN, TiN, (Ti,Mo)C,
   (Ti,Mo)CN, (Ti,Mo)N, MoC, MoCN, MoN. The chemical film compositions were
   determined using the energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX) method,
   Vickers hardness measurements were made. The structures of the deposited
   layers were examined by means of X-ray diffraction. The electrical
   measurements of the deposited layers covered resistivity (rho) and
   temperature coefficient of resistivity (TCR). It has been found that the
   measurements of electrical properties may be very sensitive indicators
   of the layer composition and structure. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier

AB The kinetics of surface segregation in embrittled and de-embrittled Fe-3
   at.-%Ni-0.011 at/-%Sb containing 20 at.-ppm S was studied by Auger
   electron spectroscopy at temperatures ranging from 550 to 630 degrees C.
   In addition, information on the grain boundary segregation in the
   embrittled material has been obtained from analysing intercrystalline
   fracture surfaces. Grain boundary segregation is characterised by
   cosegregation of Sb and Ni, which is increasingly promoted as the grain
   boundary concentration of C decreases. On the surface of the embrittled
   material, segregation competition of S and Sb is observed. This is
   stimulated by Sb enrichment via grain boundaries. In the de-embrittled
   material, Sb surface segregation is inhibited so that S remains the
   dominant segregation. These differences in the kinetic behaviour are
   consistent with the demixing model of temper embrittlement, Further the
   S-Sb segregation competition leads to ail inhomogeneous surface
   chemistry; some of the individual facets ale enriched with Sb, others
   with S. Thus, the S-Sb surface segregation competition is not only
   characterised by the presence of fast diffusion paths but also by
   anisotropy. The conditions for the segregation dominance are analysed
   using Guttmann's equilibrium segregation model for multicomponent
   systems. (C) 1997 The Institute of Materials.

AB Corrosion tests of a series of heat-resistant nickel alloys were
   performed in a molten 48.7% MgCl2-38.2% KCl-13.1% NaCl ternary eutectic
   at 500-900 degrees C and with up to 30-h exposure. Chloride corrosion
   exhibits intergranular features and causes weight loss an order of
   magnitude higher than common gaseous oxidation does. Time dependence of
   the weight loss is intermediate between parabolic and linear (1 < n <
   2), while the temperature dependence is exponential. The loss is
   significantly decreased only by alloying with aluminum. The corrosion
   resistance of NiAl intermetallide is relatively high (it surpasses
   nickel 60-70 times and commercial heat-resistant alloys 20-30 times). As
   a function of chromium and titanium contents in binary nickel alloys,
   corrosion has minima at 10-12% Cr and 5-7% Ti, respectively; the minimum
   in multicomponent alloys is located 2-3% lower. Cobalt, molybdenum, and
   tungsten affect the chloride corrosion resistance nonadditively, but
   even the best variants of alloying are characterized by corrosion of up
   to 20-30 g/(m(2) h). In order to achieve the required corrosion
   resistance, commercial high-temperature alloys should be aluminized or
   protected by a Ni(Co)Al-(beta-phase) intermetallic-based coating.

AB Time-of-flight neutron diffraction has been used to study structural
   anisotropy in a wide-ribbon sample of the multicomponent metallic glass
   Fe4Co67Cr7Si8B14 prepared by continuous casting. A planar sample held at
   45 degrees to the incident beam was examined by two stationary counters
   at 90 degrees left and 90 degrees right, so that the directional
   structure factors, S-l(Q), S-w(Q), S-t(Q) corresponding to the three
   orthogonal directions in the ribbon (length I, width w and thickness t)
   were determined. It was found that the directional Structure Factor
   S-t(Q) had stronger oscillations than S-l(Q) and S-w(Q). Comparison of
   the directional S(Q) with the total structure factors for FeB and CoB
   glasses suggest that the result may be tentatively associated with
   'atomic directional pair ordering' of the Fe-Fe first neighbour pairs in
   the t direction. The diffraction data have been analysed in the context

   the metallic state (Ni-0) and only a third of them in oxidized states
   (Ni+2, Ni+3). At the same time the concentration of nickel in surface
   layer of Zr-content alloy is much smaller when compared with Mm-content
   alloy. The chemical state of the Co and V atoms is similar to the Ni
   atoms state, but their concentrations, especially of V, in the surface
   layer is smaller than that of nickel. The results of XPS have been
   compared with the data of transmission electron microscopy of the thin
   foils of La- and Zr- based alloys. Dark field microphotographs of the
   oxidized alloys indicate the presence of two different phases, which,
   according to electron microdiffraction, are nickel-based alloy and
   oxide. In the first stage of oxidation on the surface of the foil, fine
   nickel particles (about 10 nm) and an amorphous oxide phase appear.
   Complete oxidation of the foil leads to the formation of a eutectic like

AB Thick amorphous sheets with thickness up to about 200 mu m were formed
   for the Fe72Al5Ga2P10C6B4Si1 alloy with a wide supercooled liquid region
   of 58 K before crystallization. The glass transition temperature (T-g),
   crystallization temperature (T-x) and supercooled liquid region Delta
   T-x(=T-x-T-g) remain unchanged in the entire thickness range. However,
   the heat of structural relaxation decreases from 2.2 kJ/mol for the 22
   mu m thick ribbon to 0.48 kJ/mol for the 160 mu m thick ribbon,
   accompanying the increase in T-c from 597 K to 619 K. In comparison with
   the other amorphous alloy ribbons in the same Fe-(Al,Ga)-(P,C,B,Si)
   system, there is a clear tendency for the maximum sample thickness for
   glass formation (t(max)) to increase with increasing Delta T-x. The
   Fe-Al-Ga-P-C-B-Si amorphous sheets have high saturation magnetization of
   about 180 x 10(-6) Wbm/kg and low coecivity of about 5 A/m in the
   annealed state and their values remain unchanged in the thickness range
   up to 200 mu m. The permeability (mu(e)) at 1 kHz shows the high values
   of 12000 for the 30 mu m thick ribbon and decreases to about 7000 for
   the 200 mu m thick ribbon. It is to be noticed that the good soft
   magnetic properties of 5 A/m for H-c and 7000 for mu(e) as well as the
   wide supercooled liquid region of 58 K are obtained for the thick
   amorphous sheets with thickness of 150 to 200 mu m. These
   characteristics for the thick amorphous ribbons have not been obtained
   for Fe-based amorphous alloys previously reported. It is therefore
   expected that the thick amorphous ribbons cause a further extension of
   the application fields of ferromagnetic amorphous alloys.

   alloying has been investigated using thermal and structural analysis and
   compared with a metallic glass produced by liquid undercooling. The
   solid-state amorphization reaction is preceded by rapid solution of
   smaller solute atoms in the Zr matrix with a concomitant reduction in
   grain size to 10 nm at the amorphization onset. A fully amorphous
   mechanically alloyed sample shows relaxation compared to a sample
   synthesized by liquid cooling probably due to removal of residual
   inhomogeneities on the scale of the nanocrystal size at amorphization.
   While the kinetic pathways for the two synthesis methods differ, the
   relaxed amorphous phases from each method exhibit identical
   thermodynamic properties. (C) 1997 American Institute of Physics.

AB Bulk glassy alloys with thicknesses up to 75 mm and a wide supercooled
   liquid region reaching 127 K before crystallization were found to be
   fabricated in a number of multicomponent systems which satisfy the three
   empirical rules for the achievement of large glass-forming ability,
   i.e., (1) multicomponent alloy systems consisting of more than three
   constituent elements, (2) significantly different atomic size ratios
   above 12%, and (3) negative heats of mixing. The scientific significance
   of the rules has been proved based on a number of experimental data as
   well as on the kinetic theories of the nucleation and growth of a
   crystalline phase. By choosing appropriate compositions which satisfy
   the empirical rules, bulk glassy alloys in Mg-, lanthanide metal-, Zr-,
   Pd-, Fe- and Co-based systems were produced in cylindrical and sheet
   forms by various solidification processes. The bulk glassy alloys
   exhibit high tensile strength, good ductility, high elastic energy, high
   impact fracture energy and high corrosion resistance for Zr-based system
   and good soft magnetic properties for Fe-based system. Furthermore,
   their glassy alloys heated in the supercooled liquid region can be
   deformed into various shapes through viscous flow. The ideal Newtonian
   flow has been achieved in the supercooled liquid. The utilization of the
   ideal superplasticity enabled the achievement of an extremely large
   elongation exceeding 15000%. These excellent data allow us to expect
   that the bulk glassy alloys develop as a new type of engineering
   material.

   was applied. We derived, with the use of idea of generalized solution,
   an exact expression for the evolution of components distribution and its
   asymptotic approximation that can be simply applied to a variety of

   It was shown that the bending deformation is the main deformation mode
   for many multicomponent alloys, particularly, for maraging Fe-Ni steels.
   It is accomplished by co-ordinated (directed) displacements of a large
   atoms' group for a major portion of on interatomic distance without a
   rupture of interatomic bonds. Such co-operative displacements give rise
   to a large local bending of a crystal lattice. This structural element
   is interpreted as a special mesoscopic-level structure defect. A study

AB To investigate the effects of multiple film components on the morphology
   of thin films, the growth of Co and Ag on Ru(0001) has been studied by
   scanning tunneling microscopy. Two types of growth have been identified.
   In the first, the Co from the vapor phase is directly incorporated into
   existing Ag islands. In the second, islands composed of a Co-Ag mixture
   are formed by etching of the existing pure Ag islands. These two
   mechanisms, which occur simultaneously, lead to dramatically different
   morphologies. In the second case, dendritic growth of the alloy is found
   despite the fact that neither of the component metals alone exhibit this
   behavior. We attribute the dendritic growth to chemically induced step
   edge diffusion barriers which must generally exist in multicomponent
   film growth.

AB A ferromagnetic Go-based amorphous phase with a wide supercooled liquid
   region before crystallization was found to be formed in rapidly
   solidified Co(70)M(3)Al(5)Ga(2)P(15)B(4)C(1) (M=Cr or V) and
   Co67Cr3Fe3Al5Ga2P15B4C1 alloys. The glass transition temperature (T-g)
   and crystallization temperature (T-x) are in the ranges of 717 to 722 K
   and 766 to 768 K, respectively, and the temperature interval of the
   supercooled liquid region defined by the difference between T-g and T-x
   is 45 to 51 K. This is believed to be the first evidence on the
   appearance of Go-based amorphous alloys with the distinct glass
   transition and a wide supercooled liquid region. The crystallization
   takes place through a single stage resulting from the precipitation of
   four kinds of phases Co, Co2P, Co4B and Co3C. The crystallization
   process implies the necessity of a long-range rearrangement of
   constituent elements in the supercooled liquid. The necessity seems to
   be closely related to the increase in the thermal stability of the
   supercooled liquid through the retardation of the precipitation of the
   four crystalline phases. These Go-based amorphous alloys exhibit soft
   ferromagnetism with Curie temperatures ranging from 365 to 420 K. The
   saturation magnetization, coercivity and permeability at 1 kHz are in
   the range of 0.27 to 0.34 T, 4.5 to 8.0 A/m and 4600 to 5800,
   respectively. From the combination of the soft magnetic properties and a
   wide supercooled liquid region, we can expect future development of
   Go-based amorphous alloys as a new soft magnetic material with large
   glass-forming ability and good viscous deformability.

   of mixtures by power series, Unifying to a common parameter set for
   representing all component properties is possible, Generalization to
   multicomponent systems may be performed easily. The temperature
   dependence of the excess Gibbs energy, G(ex)(T,X), and of the enthalpy
   of mixing, Delta(mix)H(ex)(T,X), was incorporated, Application is
   illustrated with mass spectrometric data for liquid Au-Co alloys and
   with calorimetric data for liquid binary Sb-Sn and ternary Fe-Ni-Zr
   alloys, These three different application types demonstrate the
   usefulness, reliability, and powerfulness of the generalized Margules

AB The Ostwald ripening of a new phase during decomposition and
   crystallization in multicomponent and multiphase solutions and melts is
   investigated. Both conservative and open systems under non-isothermal
   conditions are considered. It is shown that heat of chemical reaction
   will be liberated during the Ostwald ripening of new phase nuclei, and
   the heat liberated will increase the temperature of the system, leading
   to a change in the equilibrium composition of the components. Under
   these conditions some of the nuclei of the new phase will be unstable,
   and the diffusion and thermal fields will become self-consistent. A set
   of equations describing the evolution of such systems is derived and
   solved. It is shown that the size distribution functions for nuclei of
   the new phases are universal; as for the types of phases, these are
   determined by the relation between the quantities of dissolved
   substances, temperature and chemical reaction constants. An algebraic
   set of equations determining the types of co-existing phases of chemical
   compounds is obtained, and for each phase the size distribution function
   at a given time interval is found. General equations are also derived
   defining the regions of phase coexistence in the space of concentration
   and temperature. The formation or removal of a substance, and cooling or
   heating of a system lead to a redistribution of the size and composition
   of nuclei of the new phase. It is shown that there is an opportunity to
   control the structure and composition of a decomposed multicomponent
   solid solution, and the crystallization of a multicomponent melt.

AB The solidification of peritectic alloys is reviewed, including both
   nucleation and growth. The introduction defines various compositions
   associated with binary peritectic alloys, their 'equilibrium'
   solidification, multicomponent peritectic systems, and metastable phases
   in peritectic systems. Nucleation studies are reviewed according to the
   rate of cooling and the type of specimen. Some comparisons are made with
   observations in eutectic alloys. At fast cooling rates metastable events
   can occur, as reviewed for alloys based on the AI-Ti and other systems.
   Growth studies in peritectic alloys have identified three stages: the
   'reaction' (th ree phases in contact); the 'transformation' (the
   peritectic phase thickens by solid state diffusion); and 'direct
   solidification' of the peritectic phase. Models of the stages are
   outlined and compared with experiment for various binary alloys,
   followed by a summary of observations of peritectic solidification in
   multicomponent Fe-Cr-Ni and Fe-C-X alloys. Recent advances of single
   phase solidification are reviewed and applied to phase selection with
   increased velocity, in peritectic alloys such as in Fe-Cr-Ni, Co-Sm-Cu,
   and Fe-Nd-B alloys. independent growth of the two solid phases also is
   discussed, as illustrated by superconducting Y-Ba-Cu-O alloys. Attempts
   to produce coupled structures in peritectic alloys are reviewed,
   followed by a discussion of low velocity banding. Limitations in current
   experimental or theoretical work are pointed out to aid future work in
   this important area.

AB In the area of orthopaedic implants, particularly hip joint
   replacements, only three groups of metals and alloys are considered
   suitable as load - bearing implant materials, namely Ti - Ti alloys, Co
   - Cr alloys and 316L stainless steel. As a result of problems, largely
   associated with failure of the anchoring poly methyl methacrylate (PMMA)
   bone cement, the survival of present-day load - bearing prostheses
   cannot be guaranteed beyond 10 to 12 years. This limited lifespan has
   essentially limited joint replacements to the elderly. However, the
   increased number of younger patients requiring replacements has
   accentuated the need for joint prostheses with improved performance and
   longevity.
   The introduction of joint prostheses however with significantly enhanced
   durability in rum accentuates problems associated with implant
   loosening, wear, corrosion and, in particular, biological
   incompatibility. At present, very few monolithic materials are capable
   of satisfying all service requirements, The solution may lie in the use
   of coating technology, creating new materials/surfaces with unique
   combinations of properties that cannot be achieved from the use of
   monolithic materials alone.
   The first part of this paper reviews the types of coatings that have
   been used, or are currently being considered as implant materials, to
   include porous metallic coatings, ''bio-active'' (hydroxyapatite,
   bioglasses) and ''bio-inert'' (alumina) ceramic coatings. Their
   advantages and limitations will be discussed. The second part will focus
   on recent developments in the use of refractory element based coatings,
   with specific reference to work conducted on sputtered niobium and
   tantalum. Possible avenues for research to include advanced coating
   (multilayered / multicomponent) systems, surface treatments and duplex
   engineering will be reviewed.

AB The dissolution of 2 at%Nb, 5%Mo, 4%Cr or 6%Co for the
   Fe(72-x)Al(5)Ga(2)P(11)C(6)B(4)M(x) glassy alloys was found to be
   effective for the extension of the supercooled liquid region defined by
   the difference in the glass transition temperature (T-g) and
   crystallization temperature (T-x), Delta T-x(=T-x-T-g). The Delta T-x,
   value is 60 K for the Fe-Al-Ga-P-C-B alloy and increases to 66 K for
   M=2%Nb, 62 K for 4%Mo, 61 K for 4%Cr or 6%Co. The increase in Delta T-x
   is due to the increase in T-x exceeding the degree in the increase in
   T-g. The crystallization of the glassy alloys with Delta T-x above 60 K
   takes place through a single stage of amorphous
   (Am)-alpha-Fe+Fe3P+Fe3C+Fe3B and no appreciable change in the
   crystallized structure with M elements is seen. On the other hand, the
   addition of 2%Cu or 2%Ni causes the disappearance of the glass
   transition phenomenon before crystallization, accompanying the change in
   the crystallization process to the two stages of
   Am-->Am'+alpha-Fe-->alpha-Fe+Fe3P+Fe3C+Fe3B. It is therefore concluded
   that the appearance of the wide supercooled liquid region is due to the
   retardation of crystallization resulting from the redistribution of the
   constituent elements on a long range scale which is required for the
   simultaneous precipitation of the four crystalline phases. The
   effectiveness of additional Nb, Mo or Cr element is presumably because
   the redistribution of the constituent elements leading to the
   crystallization becomes difficult.

AB Background/aims: In a European Union supported project, the idea that
   the sintering window for a tool steel, i.e., temperature region where
   full density is reached with no distortion and a sound microstructure,
   corresponding to a 3-phase region, austenite + carbide + liquid, of the
   multicomponent phase diagram, has been validated and exploited. An
   additional objective was to achieve sintering to full density as close
   as possible to 1150 degrees C, the current limit for continuous
   sintering furnaces.
   Methods: Using thermodynamic calculations, novel alloys have been
   designated, based on tungsten or molybdenum bearing iron-base
   quaternaries. Alloys have been processed following the more economical
   route of water atomisation/cold pressing/vacuum sintering/heat treating.
   Property assessment, include bend testing, tribological testing and
   cutting tests. The sintering windows were extended up to 40 degrees C
   and densification was achieved in some alloys at 1170 degrees C.
   Results and conclusions: The grades that come closest to the objectives
   of the study include a carbon-enriched T1 and novel compositions: a
   quaternary Fe- 1.3 C- 3.5 Cr- 14.1 Mo and a quinary Fe- 1.4 C- 4.0 Cr-
   14.0 Mo- 8 Co. In correctly processed materials, grain size is typically
   10/15 mu m and carbide size does not exceed 15 mu m, slightly more than
   in conventional wrought high-speed steels. Hardness ranges from 810 to
   960 Hv. Friction wear resistance (pin on disc testing) was generally
   somewhat inferior to that of conventional grades, but vanadium-bearing
   grades behave better as the MC carbides are harder than the M(6)C.
   Initial single point turning trials show characteristics comparabale to
   or better than those of standard butt welded T1 and M2 tools at speeds
   up to 45 m/min.

   Cu-containing Ce- and La-rich misch metal (Mm and Ml,
   respectively)-Ni-based stoichiometric multicomponent alloys. A severe
   decrease in the electrochemical capacity was observed for Mm-Ni-Al
   electrodes, which was believed to be related to the deterioration of
   electrical contact within the electrodes, in addition to the
   decomposition of the active materials. Although the addition of cobalt
   powders to these electrodes improved the electrical contact within the
   electrodes, it had no effect on retarding the decomposition of the
   active materials. The substitution of copper into the Mm-Ni-Al
   composition improved the stability of this electrode material, but
   brought about a decrease in its electrochemical capacity. As a
   compromise, partial substitutions of copper for cobalt in Mm-Ni-Co-Al,
   Mm-Ni-Co-Mn-Al as well as Ml-Ni-Co-Al alloys were proved to be possible
   without remarkable changes in electrode properties, but too much of this
   substitution brought about decreases in material stability, which was
   observed to be accompanied by an increase in tendency of the materials
   to pulverize during electrochemical cycling.

   the theory of growth under paraequilibrium conditions. The distribution
   of Mn and Si in ferrite and austenite in the Fe-C-Mn-Si alloy was also
   measured as a function of reaction temperature with transmission
   electron microscopy (TEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
   (EDX). The observed temperature below which alloying element partition
   ceased was in good agreement with the local equilibrium model. Whereas
   the parabolic rate constant for thickening was considerably larger than
   the amount predicted by this theory in the alloying element
   diffusion-controlled regime, the opposite was true in the carbon
   diffusion-controlled regime. Similarly, the calculated paraequilibrium
   constant was usually considerably larger than that measured
   experimentally. Synergistic enhancements of the effects of Mn and X(2)
   in diminishing thickening kinetics were observed for each X(2). The
   time-temperature-transformation (TTT) curves for the beginning of
   transformation were calculated from a modified Cahn analysis for the
   overall kinetics of grain-boundary-nucleated reactions using values of
   the nucleation rate and the parabolic growth rate constant computed from
   various models and compared with experimentally determined TTT curves.
   Substantial discrepancies between the calculated and measured curves
   were ascribed to synergistic effects of Mn and X(2) upon nucleation and
   growth kinetics.

AB Employing available experimental data for athermal f.c.c. --> b.c.c.
   martensitic transformation in binary, ternary and multicomponent Fe-base
   alloys, a model is developed and tested for the critical driving force
   at the M(s) temperature. Incorporating the theory of solid solution
   hardening, we describe the composition dependence of the athermal
   frictional work for martensitic interface motion governing the kinetics
   of barrierless heterogeneous nucleation. The available data suggests
   that the composition dependence of the athermal frictional work is of
   the same form as that for slip deformation. We have evaluated the
   athermal strengths of 14 alloying elements Al, C, Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Mo, N,
   Nb, Ni, Si, Ti, V and W from the experimental data. Except for Al, Ni
   and Co, the athermal strengths of the common substitutional alloying
   elements are similar in magnitude, while the interstitial solutes C and
   N exert a stronger influence. Previously proposed superposition laws are
   used to account for the presence of multiple solutes having different
   athermal strengths. With an improved assessment of the magnetic
   parameters of alloy systems, the model predicts M(s) temperatures within
   +40K for M(s)>300 K where thermal contributions to the frictional work
   can be neglected.

   structure was recorded as a function of the imposed growth variables. A
   special Gleeble testing procedure, developed previously where the
   solidified samples were quickly raised to a predetermined. temperature
   in the semi-solid zone and fractured, was used for the measurement of
   fracture conditions in the semi-solid region. The effect of the
   solidification process variables, namely, the temperature gradient and
   velocity, on the fracture stress in the transverse direction was to
   increase the fracture stress at a given temperature. The upper
   hot-tearing temperature was noted to be afunction of the solidification
   variables. The amount of Strain accommodation and the hot tearing
   resistance was found to be influenced by the solidification
   microstructure. Fracture maps, which include the temperature, transverse
   fracture stress and temperature gradient during solidification
   (T-sigma(T)-G), for the directionally solidified microstructures are
   presented. Castability maps are created from the microstructure and the

   though no glass transition was observed in Ti-Cu binary amorphous
   alloys. The largest temperature interval of the supercooled liquid
   region (DELTAT(x)) is as large as 90 K for Ti50Cu25Ni20Co5. There is a
   tendency for DELTAT(x) to increase with an increase in storage modulus
   and with a decrease in loss modulus. It is therefore presumed that the
   increase in DELTAT(x) for the multicomponent amorphous alloy is due to
   the suppression of crystallization for the supercooled liquid resulting
   from the increase in viscosity.

   Re-containing CMSX4 and V-containing RR2000 alloys, together with TMS63
   are the subjects of this study. It is found that Ti, Ta and Hf have a
   strong preference for the gamma' phase, whereas Cr, Co, W, Re and Mo
   tend to dissolve in the gamma phase. V has a very weak preference for
   the gamma phase. The results agree very well with both ADP and CVM. The
   APFIM analyses have also revealed that Re atoms in CMSX4 tend to
   preferentially occupy the sites normally designated for Al atoms in the
   gamma' phase. It is demonstrated that the site occupancy of other

   of Cr, Ti and Ni. The effect of solute atom distribution on creep

AB Surface adatom modifiers that act as promoters or poisons on transition
   metal catalysts can have a large influence on adsorption kinetics along
   with their influence on adsorption energetics. Accounting for this
   effect requires recognition of the role of a new kind of intrinsic
   precursor -the modifier precursor state. A mathematical description of
   the adsorption kinetics of molecules on chemically modified or
   bimetallic surfaces incorporating this state has been derived based on
   Kisliuk's statistical model [P. Kisliuk, J. Phys. Chem. Solids 3, 95
   (1957)]. The resulting equation can be used to explain satisfactorily
   data on CO adsorption kinetics on chemically modified (Cl-, P-, S-, H-,
   O-, and K-precovered) Pt(111) surfaces. This concept should have broad
   implications for many systems in heterogeneous catalysis, such as
   bimetallic and alloy surfaces and coadsorbed layers, and for the
   multicomponent surfaces that are involved in materials growth and
   processing.

   enthalpies, which are more negative than those of liquid binary Fe-Ti
   alloys because of the strong interaction between the Co and Ti atoms.
   The enthalpy data have been fitted by a least-squares method to a

   coarsening resistance.  Current Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner (LSW)
   theory[2,3] cannot properly be used to describe the coarsening behavior
   of multicomponent carbides, which involves concentrations and
   diffusivities of two or more solutes and nonspherical carbide
   morphologies.  A model is introduced for the coarsening resistance of
   multicomponent carbides.  This model treats the coarsening of
   shape-preserving particle and is applicable to rodlike particles.

AB In high Co-Ni steels containing the strong carbide-forming elements Mo,
   Cr, and W, secondary hardening is accomplished by the precipitation of
   fine-scale M2C alloy carbides.  Thermodynamic stability and coarsening
   resistance of these carbides depend on the alloy content of these
   elements.  A model for the M2C coarsening kinetics in multicomponent
   alloys has been used to identify the optimum alloying addition for
   maximum coarsening resistance and as a basis for selection of four
   experimental alloy steels.  Necessary information pertaining to the
   equilibrium in these steels was obtained using the Thermo-Calc software
   and database developed at the Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm,
   Sweden.

AB In order to develop a high capacity hydrogen-absorbing alloy electrode
   based on the Zr-V-Ni system pseudobinary Laves-phase, a partial
   substitution of Ti for Zr and/or partial substitutions of Co, Fe, Mn for
   Ni were attempted.  It was found that Mn is the hydrogen content
   enlarging element and Ti, Co, Fe are the hydrogen instabilizing
   elements.  By the appropriate combinations of these substitutions, the
   larger discharge capacities up to 400 mAh g-1 were successfully
   exhibited.  These effects of the substitutions were discussed in terms
   of the electronegativity of each substituent and the lattice expansion
   or contract effect.  The results of charge/discharge cycling tests
   indicated that the large amount of Ti-substitution is undesirable in
   cycle-life.  On the other hand, the Co-substitution and an addition of
   cobalt powder into the electrodes were effective for a long cycle-life. 
   These effects of cobalt were discussed in terms of the cobalt-ion
   reduction on the alloy surface in charge process.  Furthermore, it was
   also found that long time grinding of the alloy powder with nickel or
   copper powder was effective for the electrode activation.

AB A general thermodynamic model is developed that describes the mixing
   properties of minor and trace divalent cations (Ni, Ca, Mn, Co) in
   ferromagnesian olivines in terms of octahedral site order-disorder and
   symmetric enthalpies of mixing.  Two cases of this model are presented. 
   The first is applicable to true ternary solutions, where minor
   components (e.g., Ni, Mn, Co) substitute on both octahedral sites, and
   the second is appropriate for quadrilateral solutions, where
   substitution is limited to a single site (e.g., Ca on M2).  The ternary
   model is calibrated for Ni-bearing olivines from consideration of site
   occupancy determinations and heterogeneous exchange equilibria. 
   Ca-bearing olivines are calibrated from consideration of miscibility
   gaps.  Both the models for (Ni,Mg,Fe)2SiO4 and (Ca,Mg,Fe)2SiO4 olivines
   are internally consistent with Sack and Ghiorso's (1989) analysis of
   ferromagnesian olivines and with the standard state data base of Berman
   (1988).
   The resulting analysis of the mixing properties of nickel magnesium iron
   olivines indicates small negative deviations from ideality in Fe-free
   olivines and greater negative deviations in ferromagnesian olivines. 
   Predictions of Ni-Fe exchange between olivines and FeNi alloys agree
   with experimentally determined distributions.  Predicted mixing
   properties of calcian olivines on the Ca-poor side of the solvus are
   similar to those calculated from the formulation of Davidson and
   Lindsley (1989), but small differences arise from adoption here of a
   larger Fe-Mg interaction energy.

AB A model has been developed for coarsening kinetics of M2C carbides and
   subsequently applied to optimize the composition of high Co-Ni steels
   with respect to the overaging resistance during secondary hardening. 
   The model accounts for both effects of multicomponent diffusion and
   precipitate shape anisotropy.  It is found that W additions to high
   Co-Ni steels significantly reduces the coarsening rate constant. 
   Calculations for two W-free 14Co-10Ni steels at a typical tempering
   temperature of 783K reveals a beneficial effect of the Cr substitution
   with Mo, in a good agreement with available experimental data.
