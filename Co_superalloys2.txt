TI Revealing dendritic pattern formation in Ni, Fe and Co alloys using
   synchrotron tomography
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB The microstructural patterns formed during liquid to solid phase transformations control the properties of a wide range of materials. We developed a novel methodology that enables in situ quantification of the microstructures formed during solidification of high temperature advanced alloys via synchrotron tomography. The patterns formed are captured in 4D (3D plus time) using a methodology which exploits three separate advances: a bespoke high temperature environment cell; the development of high X-ray contrast alloys; and a novel environmental encapsulation system. This methodology is demonstrated on Ni, Fe, and Co advanced alloy systems, revealing dendritic pattern formation. We present detailed quantification of microstructural pattern evolution in a novel high attenuation contrast Co-Hf alloy, including microstructural patterning and dendrite tip velocity. The images are quantified to provide 4D experimental data of growth and coarsening mechanisms in Co alloys, which are used for a range of applications from energy to aerospace.

TI Combined phase-field crystal plasticity simulation of P- and N-type
   rafting in Co-based superalloys
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB We combine a phase-field model with a crystal plasticity model to simulate the microstructural evolution during creep in the Co-based superalloy ERBOCo-2Ta. Three-dimensional simulations of tensile and compressive creep tests in [100] direction were performed to study the rafting behavior in Co-based superalloys. The loss of coherency between gamma matrix and gamma' precipitate, which is essential for the understanding of rafted structures, is modeled in relation to the dislocation activity in the gamma-channels. Special attention is given to the interplay between creep deformation and microstructure stability. Appropriate constitutive modeling is applied to simulate realistic microstructure evolution under creep conditions. Thus, with the removal of the misfit stress, gamma' precipitates lose their cuboidal shape and form rafts. During N-type rafting more gamma' precipitates coalesce than during P-type rafting. The gamma' volume fraction during rafting increases under tensile stress but decreases under compressive stress. The morphological evolution of gamma' precipitates under tensile and compressive stresses in Co-based superalloy is consistent with the rafting characteristics in experimental observations.

AB The demand for higher engine operating temperatures to improve aeroengine efficiency has meant that increasing levels of alloying additions are being added to single-crystal nickel-base superalloys for turbine blades applications. Whilst better mechanical and environmental performance may be obtained with these alloying additions, they also destabilise the alloys forming topologically closed-packed (TCP) phases. In this study, the formation of TCP phases has been studied in a series of four alloys designated LDSX1-4 which have a systematic variation in the levels of Co, Mo and W. The alloys were exposed to elevated temperatures between 900-1100 degrees C for up to 1000 hours. This was followed by detailed analysis of the microstructures in the SEM. Identification of the TCP phases in selected alloys was also carried out. The effects of each alloying addition on TCP phase formation is discussed in light of these results.

AB Trace amounts of selenium and tellurium in nickel-based heat-resisting superalloys and constituent metals were separated by a reductive coprecipitation technique with palladium using ascorbic acid, and determined by electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry. Selenium and tellurium each added in 1 mu g amounts to solutions of metals (Ni, Al, Cr, Co, Cu, Mn, Mo, V, Ti, Nb, Ta, W and Zr), were recovered by the proposed method. In all metals, both selenium and tellurium were quantitatively recovered in H2SO4, H2SO4-tartaric acid, H2SO4-oxalic acid or H2SO4-H3PO4 solution. In Ni, Al, Nb, Ta, W and Zr, they were also quantitatively recovered in HF-H2SO4 solution. This proposed method could be adapted to determine trace amounts of selenium and tellurium in several alloys (heat-resisting superalloys, stainless steels and high speed steels).

AB Since the discovery [1] of gamma' precipitate (L1(2) - Co-3 (Al, W)) in the Co-Al-W ternary system, there has been an increased interest in Co-based superalloys. Since these alloys have two phase microstructures (gamma + gamma') similar to Ni-based superalloys [2], they are viable candidates in high temperature applications, particularly in land-based turbines. The role of alloying on stability of the gamma' phase has been an active area of research. In this study, electronic structure calculations were done to probe the effect of alloying in Co3W with L1(2) structure. Compositions of type Co-3(W, X), (where X/Y = Mn, Fe, Ni, Pt, Cr, Al, Si, V, W, Ta, Ti, Nb, Hf, Zr and Mo) were studied. Effect of alloying on equilibrium lattice parameters and ground state energies was used to calculate Vegard's coefficients and site preference related data. The effect of alloying on the stability of the L1(2) structure vis a vis other geometrically close packed ordered structures was also studied for a range of Co3X compounds. Results suggest that the penchant of element for the W sublattice can be predicted by comparing heats of formation of Co3X in different structures.

TI Modeling of Thermal Expansion Coefficients of Ni-Based Superalloys Using
   Artificial Neural Network
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING AND PERFORMANCE
AB The objective of this work is to model the thermal expansion coefficients of various Ni-based superalloys used in gas turbine components. The thermal expansion coefficient is described as a function of temperature, chemical composition including Ni, Cr, Co, Mo, W, Ta, Nb, Al, Ti, B, Zr, and C contents as well as heat treatment including solutionizing and aging. Experimental values are well described and their relative changes well correlated by the model. Because gas turbine engine components operate under severe loading conditions and at high and varying temperatures, the prediction of their thermal expansion coefficient is crucial. The model developed in this work can be useful for design optimizations for minimizing thermo-mechanical stresses between the base alloys and potential protective coatings or adjacent components. It can substantially contribute to improve the performance and service life of gas turbine components.

TI Effect of gamma ' volume fraction for creep strength of Ni-base
   superalloys at 800 degrees C
SO JOURNAL OF THE JAPAN INSTITUTE OF METALS
AB The creep behavior of Ni-base single-crystal superalloys TMS-75 and TMS-26 with various gamma' fractions was investigated at 800 degrees C and 735 MPa. Creep strength of two-phase alloys was superior to single phase alloys. The creep rupture lives were the longest for the 60% gamma' alloys. In contrast with creep behavior above 900 degrees C, 40% gamma' alloys were stronger than 80% gamma' alloys at 800 degrees C. 60% gamma' alloy of TMS-26 was much stronger than that of TMS-75 because of lower Co and Re contents and lower stacking fault energy. Changes in the microstructure after creep rupture were studied. While raft structure was observed perpendicular in 60% gamma' alloy of TMS-26, rafts were parallel in 80% gamma' alloy. Super stacking faults were often observed in gamma' precipitates in 60% gamma' alloy of TMS-75. However, super stacking faults were not frequent in the other alloys. Usual a/2 < 110 > dislocations were observed in gamma matrix in 20 and 40% gamma' alloys, and superdislocations were observed in coarse gamma' phases in 80% gamma' alloy.

TI Tensile properties and structure of several superalloys after long-term
   exposure to LIF and vacuum at 1173 K
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING AND PERFORMANCE
AB The use of the solid-to-liquid phase transformation of LiF to store thermal energy is under consideration for a space-based solar dynamic system. Although advantageous in terms of its energy density, the melting point of this salt (1121 K) is beyond the commonly accepted upper-use temperature of 1100 K for chromium-bearing superalloys in vacuum. However, one commercially available nickel-base superalloy (Hastelloy B-2) is chromium free; unfortunately, because of its high molybdenum content, this alloy can form phases that cause high-temperature embrittlement. To test the suitability of Hastelloy B-2, it has been exposed to molten LiF, its vapor and vacuum at 1173 K for 2500, 5000, and 10(4) h. For control, the chromium-containing cobalt-base Haynes alloy 188 and nickel-base Haynes alloy 230 were also exposed to LiF and vacuum at 1173 K for 5000 h. Neither LiF nor vacuum exposures had any significant effect on Hastelloy B-2 in terms of microstructural surface damage or weight change. Measurement of the post exposure tensile properties of Hastelloy B-2, nevertheless, revealed low tensile ductility at 1050 K. Such embrittlement and low strength at elevated temperatures appear to preclude the use of Hastelloy B-2 as a containment material for LiF. Little evidence of significant attack by LiF was seen in either of the chromium-containing superalloys; however, considerable weight loss and near-surface microstructural damage occurred in both alloys exposed to vacuum. Although measurement of the post exposure room-temperature tensile properties of Haynes alloys 188 and 230 revealed no significant loss of strength or ductility, the severe degree of microstructural damage found in unshielded alloys exposed to vacuum indicates that chromium-bearing superalloys might also be unsuitable for prolonged containment of LiF in space above 1100 K.

TI Effect of Mo:W ratio on segregation behavior and creep strength of
   nickel-based single crystal superalloys
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB In past decades, molybdenum (Mo) has demonstrated the potential to replace tungsten (W) in designing lighter nickel-based single crystal superalloys with enhanced creep resistance. In this research, three groups of nickel-based single crystal superalloys are designed and prepared by tuning the Mo:W ratio. The experimental observations show that the primary and secondary dendrite arm spacings are both independent on Mo:W ratio, but the gamma/gamma' eutectic volume fraction decreases as Mo:W ratio increases. The electron probe microanalysis reveals that Re, W and Co segregate to dendrite core regions, while Al, Ti, Cr, Mo and Ta to interdendritic regions. The microsegregation of Ta, W and Re are gradually relieved with increasing Mo:W ratio. Atom probe tomography results further indicate that Cr and Mo are depleted in y/y' eutectics, leading to the enrichment of Cr and Mo at interdendritic regions away from gamma/gamma' eutectics. Creep rupture results show that the rupture life at 1040 degrees C/145 MPa is improved as Mo:W ratio increases.

TI Room and high temperature wear behaviors of nickel and cobalt base weld
   overlay coatings on hot forging dies
SO WEAR
AB The lifetime of dies used for production of forged parts is variable and determined by wear rate, plastic deformation, thermal and mechanical fatigue. These tools are subjected to extreme temperature at high unit pressures for short durations and must withstand multiple cycles while maintaining dimensional stability. This paper is an investigation into the use of nickel and cobalt base superalloys as wear resistant hardfacing materials on H11 tool steel. Three weld overlay alloys including Inconel 625, Stellite 6 and Stellite 21 were deposited on H11 steel substrates using tungsten inert gas welding (TIG) process. Wear tests were carried out using a pin-on-disk wear tester at room temperature and 550 degrees C. Microhardness of the weld overlays was obtained and the worn surfaces were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results of the laboratory tests were then compared with the results obtained from field studies. The results showed a much lower wear at high temperature with the weld overlays due to formation of smooth compacted oxide layers on the wear surfaces. Inconel 625 showed the best wear behavior among the weld overlays at high temperature. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Effects of strain amount and strain rate on grain structure of a novel
   high Co nickel-based polycrystalline superalloy
SO MATERIALS & DESIGN
AB The development of nickel-based superalloys with high Co addition has aroused widespread interest recently owing to their potential application in hot sections of gas turbine. However, how hot working parameters impact the grain evolution of these superalloys remains to be studied systematically. In this work, high-throughput double cone ( DC) specimen, which yielded gradient strain at different regions in a single sample after hot compression, were designed to investigate the thermo-mechanical behaviors of a novel superalloy. Superslovus treatment was subsequently conducted to investigate the susceptibility to abnormal grain growth (AGG). By means of finite element simulation, transmission electron microscope (TEM), and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), it was found that slow strained DC was preferred to obtain a well-distributed grain structure after supersolvus annealing, owing to its adequate dynamical recrystallization (DRX) and dynamical recovery (DRV) during deformation.

AB Two-nanostructure intermetallics (nanoporous film and nanocube) on single crystal nickel-based superalloys were fabricated by electrochemical dealloying in an aqueous electrolyte containing 1 wt% (NH4)(2)SO4 and 1 wt% citric acid solution respectively. Electrochemical properties of two phases in single crystal nickel-based superalloys are different, and it has been utilized to dissolve preferentially gamma matrix phase and gamma' phase remains passive. The electrochemical corrosion behavior of a Ni-based superalloy after high temperature creep was investigated using an EG&G PAR M273 potentiostat. The results indicated that the microstructure after high temperature creep determined the morphology of the resultant gamma' phase intermetallics after dealloying. The morphologies and structure of nanoporous film and nanocube were characterized using a JSM-6700 (Japan) field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) and JEM-3010 high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM).

SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The potential of cast IN939 superalloy to be converted to wrought alloy has been explored in the present work. For this objective, bars of cast alloy were rolled under different conditions and then subjected to various heat treatment cycles. The results indicated that the yield strength, ultimate tensile strength and ductility of the wrought IN939 alloy are superior to the cast version. The stress rupture properties of wrought IN939 superalloy are better than those of the widely used superalloys, such as Nimonic 90 and Waspaloy, and approach the alloy Nimonic 105 properties. This is very notable because Nimonic 105 contains similar to 45 vol.-% gamma' that is much greater than the volume fraction of those strengthening precipitates in the alloy IN939 (similar to 35%). On the whole, the wrought form of this alloy has a high potential for manufacturing hot components to be used safely under aggressive turbine environment.

TI Use of plasma spray technology for deposition of high temperature
   oxidation/corrosion resistant coatings - a review
SO MATERIALS AND CORROSION-WERKSTOFFE UND KORROSION
AB High temperature oxidation is one of the main failure modes of the hot-section components in gas turbines, boilers, waste incinerations, diesel engines, coal gasification plants, chemical plants and other energy generation systems. In such applications the use of Fe-, Ni- and Co-based alloys, especially of superalloys is well known. The superior mechanical strength and good corrosion resistance of the superalloys at high temperature make them favorites for such applications. However, the presence of combustion gases constitutes an extreme environment and hot corrosion is inevitable when superalloys are used at high temperatures for long durations of time. Therefore these alloys need to be protected against this type of oxidation. Several countermeasures have been suggested in the literature to combat the same. One such countermeasure against hot corrosion and oxidation constitutes the deposition of protective coatings on these alloys. Among the various techniques used for deposition of coatings, plasma spraying is a versatile technology that has been successful as a reliable cost-effective solution for many industrial problems. It allows the spraying of a wide range of high performance materials from superalloys and refractory intermetallic compounds to ceramics with continuously increasing commercial applications. Furthermore it does not cause deterioration of the substrate alloys, and relatively thick coatings can be formed with high deposition rates. In this paper the technique of plasma spraying has been detailed and the role of plasma sprayed coatings to arrest high temperature oxidation has been discussed with the help of a comprehensive literature survey. The main focus of this investigation is the studies related to plasma sprayed Ni-CrA1Y, Ni-Cr, Nickel aluminide and Co-based coatings.

   Temperatures in the Development of Co-Re-Based Alloys for Gas Turbines
SO METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND
   MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Co-Re alloy development is prompted by the search for new materials for future gas turbines which can be used at temperatures considerably higher than the current day single crystal Ni-based superalloys. The Co-Re-based alloys have been designed to have very high melting range, and they are meant for application at + 373 K (+100 degrees C) above Ni-superalloys. They are significantly different from the conventional Co-based alloys that are used in static components of today's gas turbines, and the Co-Re alloys have never been used for structural applications before. The Co-Re-Cr system has complex microstructure with many different phases present. Phase transformations and stabilities of fine strengthening precipitates at high temperatures remain mostly unexplored in the Co-Re alloys, and to develop basic understanding, model ternary and quaternary compositions were studied within the alloy development program. In situ neutron and synchrotron measurements at high temperatures were extensively used for this purpose, and some recent results from the in situ measurements are presented. In particular, the effect of boron doping in Co-Re alloys and the stabilities of the fine TaC precipitates at high temperatures were investigated. A fine dispersion of TaC precipitates strengthens some Co-Re alloys, and their stabilities at the application temperatures are critical.

TI Comprehensive first-principles study of transition-metal substitution in
   the gamma phase of nickel-based superalloys
SO CALPHAD-COMPUTER COUPLING OF PHASE DIAGRAMS AND THERMOCHEMISTRY
AB In order to elucidate the role of various M-alloying additions in the fcc-type gamma phase of nickel-based superalloys, we have performed a comprehensive and systematical computation on all 3d-, 4d- and 5d-M alloying additions substituting in the Ni lattice using the same standard of the first-principles calculations within the framework of the density functional theory. The results show that the substitution enthalpies of Sc, Ti, V, Mn, Fe, Co, Zn, Zr, Nb, Hf, Ta, and Pt are negative, while the others elements have positive substitution enthalpies. To further explore the contributions of various factors to the substitution enthalpy, we have attempted to divide the substitution enthalpy into two parts. The first one is the mechanical deformation energy caused by the atomic volume change because of the M-alloying additions substituting in fcc Ni and the other one is the chemical and magnetic energy through electronic hybridizations and local magnetic interactions. It is found that the substitution enthalpy is a consequence of the balancing of these two contributions. Furthermore, we have attempted to correlate their mechanical deformation energies with metallic atomic radii of substitutional M-alloying addition with respect to Ni, and the chemical and magnetic energies with transferred charges between M-alloying addition and Ni, which are indeed associated with the so-called electronegativity difference.

TI EFFECT OF COBALT ALUMINATE CONTENT AND POURING TEMPERATURE ON

   CASTINGS
SO ARCHIVES OF METALLURGY AND MATERIALS
AB The effect of cobalt aluminate inoculant addition and melt-pouring temperature on the structure and mechanical properties of Ni-based superalloy was studied. The first major move to control the quality of investment cast blades and vanes was the control of grain size. Cobalt aluminate (CoAl2O4) is the most frequently utilized inoculant in the lost-wax casting process of Ni-based superalloys. The inoculant in the prime coat of moulds and pouring temperature play a significant role in grain size control. The fmest surface grains were obtained when the internal surface of shell mould was coated with cobalt aluminate and subsequently pouring was at 1480 degrees C. The influence of selected casting parameters and inoculant addition on mechanical properties was investigated on the basis of tensile, creep and hardness testing. The effect of grain refinement on mechanical properties were consistent with established theories. Tests conducted at ambient temperature indicated a beneficial effect of grain refinement both on tensile strength and hardness. In contrast at elevated temperature during creep, the reverse trend was observed.

TI Prospect of nickel-based superalloys with low Cr and high Re contents
SO ISIJ INTERNATIONAL
AB There is a clear trend of lowering Cr and increasing Re content in the evolution from the 1st- to the 2nd- and to the 3rd-generation Ni-based single crystal (SC) superalloys. Following this trend, two groups of superalloys were made with the aid of the d-electrons concept. One is the A-group which is characterized by the lower Cr and the higher Re contents in the alloys than in the 3rd-generation SC alloys. A homogeneous microstructure was obtained in these A-group superalloys containing 0, 1 and 2 mass% Cr, while their Re and Co contents were set at about 8.5 mass% and 13.5 mass% respectively. The other is the B-group which is characterized by the lower Re content than the A-group. Three alloys in the B-group containing 2.5, 4.2 and 12.1 mass% Cr were studied for the comparison with the A-group. According to a hot corrosion test, weight gain occurred in a Cr-free alloy instead of observing weight loss in Cr containing alloys. Hot corrosion resistance of 2 mass% Cr alloy was quite good as long as the alloy contains about 8.5 mass% Be. The oxidation resistance was improved remarkably in 1 mass% Cr alloy than in the Cr-free alloy. It was found that the addition of at least 2 mass% Cr into superalloys is necessary in order to keep good surface stability at high temperatures. Also, it was seen that Re is a harmful element for oxidation resistance.

TI Coupling between Re segregation and gamma/gamma ' interfacial
   dislocations during high-temperature, low-stress creep of a nickel-based
   single-crystal superalloy
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB The synergistic action of local elemental distribution, and in particular Re doping, with interfacial dislocations at the gamma/gamma' interface is still one of the most considered and unclear issues during creep of nickel-based single-crystal superalloys. In order to investigate this problem, a detailed characterization of interfacial dislocations in a DD6 superalloy after creep loading for 12 h at high temperature and low stress was carried out using transmission electron microscopy and high-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy techniques. In addition, the local elemental distribution near dislocation core regions was determined by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping. It was found for the first time that three types of interfacial protrusions are formed at the gamma/gamma' interface after creep loading for 12 h under conditions of high temperature and low stress and demonstrated that the formation of these features originates from dislocation motion. Additionally, EDS mapping provides evidence for co-segregation of Re with Cr and Co at the tip of the protrusions. Based on this, a model concerning dislocation core structure and dislocation climb was proposed to explain the different morphology of the protrusions. The observations highlight the importance of the coupling between Re segregation and gamma/gamma' interfacial dislocations for improving creep properties in nickel-based superalloys. The results of the study will be beneficial for the design of new high-temperature materials and for understanding the origin of the effect of Re additions in nickel-based single-crystal superalloys.

AB The phase constituents of alloys from the (Ni,Co)(85)(Al,Ti)(15) plane of the Ni-Co-Al-Ti quaternary system were investigated following prolonged exposure at 750 degrees C. Microstructural investigations confirmed the existence of a continuous A1-L1(2)) two-phase region in the Ni-Co-Al-Ti quaternary system between Ni-Ni3Al and Co-Co3Ti. The lattice misfits of alloys from this quaternary system were determined using neutron diffraction. With increasing contents of Ti the positive lattice misfit increases up to +0.79% in the Ti-containing alloys, which leads to an increasing tetragonal distortion of the gamma matrix phase due to the increasing coherency stresses.

AB Samples of commercially pure nickel and two common superalloys were prepared by electroplating a thin layer of platinum on the surface, then exposing the samples to temperatures of 950 degreesC and 1080 degreesC for periods of two and six hours. Using electron probe micro analysis (EMPA), elemental composition profiles were obtained from the samples following the diffusion steps. The relative diffusion coefficients for a number of elements were determined using a classical Boltzmann-Matano method. As expected, it was discovered that elements such as cobalt, chromium, titanium and tantalum displayed a significant diffusional response in this relatively short time, while tungsten, molybdenum and rhenium diffused to a lesser degree under these conditions. It was discovered that there is significant interaction between many of the alloying elements in these systems during the diffusion anneal. The limitations of the analytical technique are summarized.

TI Stress to produce a minimum creep rate of 10(-5) %/h and stress to cause

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRESSURE VESSELS AND PIPING
CT Conference on Creep and Fracture in High-Temperature Components - Design

CL Lancaster, PA
AB Long-term creep and rupture data of NIMS Creep Data Sheets show that the time to rupture at a minimum creep rate of 10(-5) %/h is longer than 105 h for most ferritic steels, while it is shorter than 105 h for most austenitic steels, Ni base and Co base superalloys. This is correlated with the larger total elongation in ferritic steels than in austenitic steels and in Ni base and Co base superalloys at a minimum creep rate of 10(-5)%/h. However, 67% of the average stress to cause rupture at the end of 105 It is lower than the stress to produce a minimum creep rate of 10-5 %/h for all the materials examined. This indicates that the ASME allowable stress in a high-temperature creep region is determined by creep rupture data but not by creep strain data. The creep and creep rate curves are compared between 2.25Cr-1Mo steel and 18Cr-8Ni austenitic steel at approximately the same minimum creep rate. 18Cr-8Ni austenitic steel reaches a minimum creep rate in shorter time and spends shorter time in the acceleration creep before creep rupture than 2.25Cr-1Mo steel at low stress and long time conditions. This is correlated with different microstructure evolution during creep. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Compositional effects on the cyclic oxidation resistance of conventional
   superalloys
SO MATERIALS AT HIGH TEMPERATURES
AB The 1100 degrees C cyclic oxidation performance of 25 Ni-base commercial and developmental alloys was compiled from an extensive database and ranked according to the 200 h weight change. Cyclic oxidation performance of superalloys is directly controlled by composition. These conventionally cast superalloys were composed of base elements [Ni-Co-Cr-Al], refractory elements [Nb-Mo-Ta-W], oxygen-active elements [Ti-Zr-Hf], light elements [B, C], and occasionally [V-Mn-Si], with P and S trace impurities. The oxidation results were broadly categorised as less than 4 mg/cm(2) weight loss for alloys with high 5-6% Al and 3-9% Ta, and with low <= 1% Ti ( wt.%). Conversely, weight loss of 200-300 mg/cm2 characterised alloys containing low < 3.5% Al, no Ta, and high > 3% Ti. These trends correlated with beneficial and detrimental scale phases previously reported. An unambiguous Cr effect was masked because of its strongly coupled, but inverse, correlation with Al. Multiple linear regression was used to fit alloy composition to a simple logarithmic weight change transform. The function contained 10 terms and yielded a correlation coefficient, r(2), of 0.84. Various graphical representations helped to further illustrate, quantify, and predict complex oxidation effects within a 10-element compositional space.

TI Type II Hot Corrosion Screening Tests of a Cr2AlC MAX Phase Compound
SO OXIDATION OF METALS
AB Low-temperature hot corrosion tests were performed on bulk Cr2AlC MAX phase compounds for the first time. This material is a known alumina-former with good oxidation and Type I high-temperature hot corrosion resistance. Unlike traditional (Ni,Co)CrAl alumina formers, it contains no Ni or Co that may react with Na2SO4 salt deposits needed to form corrosive mixed (Ni,Co)SO4-Na2SO4 eutectic salts active in Type II hot corrosion. Cr2AlC samples coated with 20K(2)SO(4)-80Na(2)SO(4) salt were exposed to 300ppm SO2 at 700 degrees C for times up to 500h. Weight change, recession, and cross-sectional microstructures identified some reactivity, but much reduced (<1/10) compared to a Ni(Co) superalloy baseline material. Layered Al2O3/Cr2O3 scales were indicated, either separated by or intermixed with some retained salt. However, there was no conclusive indication of salt melting. Accelerated oxidation was proposed to explain the results, and coarse Cr7C3 impurities appeared to play a negative role. In contrast, the superalloy exhibited outer Ni(Co) oxide and inner Cr2O3 scales, with Cr-S layers at the interfaces. Massive spallation of the corrosion layers occurred repeatedly for the superalloy, but not at all for Cr2AlC. This indicates some potential for Cr2AlC as LTHC-resistant coatings for superalloys.

TI Planar defect formation in the gamma' phase during high temperature
   creep in single crystal CoNi-base superalloys
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB The structure and formation mechanism of extended planar defects in the gamma/gamma' microstructure of creep deformed CoNi-base single crystal superalloys have been studied by conventional and advanced transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Planar defects in numerous isolated as well as contiguous gamma' precipitates on 011) planes reveal a characteristic configuration whereby superlattice intrinsic stacking faults (SISF) are fully embedded within antiphase boundaries (APB). Detailed analysis revealed that a leading 1/3[1 12] superpartial dislocation first creates an SISF. The SISF is then transformed into an APB by a trailing 1/6[112] partial dislocation. The partial is left inside the precipitate and remains as a dislocation loop. Thus, the entire shearing process constitutes a crystallographic slip of type 1/2[112]. A force balance analysis indicates that the initial APB energy exceeds the SISF energy. However, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS) indicates pronounced local reordering and diffusion processes near both types of planar defects. The APB qualitatively adopts the composition of the gamma phase whereas the SISF locally changes its composition towards that of the Co3W D0(19) phase. We propose that these atomic diffusion processes determine the formation and shrinkage of the loops. A post mortem in situ TEM heating experiment shows that with increasing temperature the APBs exhibit complete faceting into 000) planes followed by coarsening, eventually leading to disintegration of the gamma' precipitate. This indicates a detrimental impact of APBs as potential nuclei for fragmentation of the gamma/gamma' microstructure in CoNi-base superalloys. (C) 2016 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Effects of Withdrawal Rate on the Microstructure of Directionally
   Solidified GH4720Li Superalloys
SO MATERIALS
AB Increasing the ingot size of GH4720Li superalloys makes it difficult to control their microstructure, and the withdrawal rate is an important factor in controlling and refining the microstructure of GH4720Li superalloys. In this study, GH4720Li superalloy samples were prepared via Bridgman-type directional solidification with different withdrawal rates. The morphology and average size of the dendrites in the stable growth zone during directional solidification in each sample, morphology and average size of the ' phases, and microsegregation of each alloying element were analyzed using optical microscopy, Photoshop, Image Pro Plus, field emission scanning electron microscopy, and electron probe microanalysis. Increasing the withdrawal rate significantly helped in refining the superalloy microstructure; the average secondary dendrite arm spacing decreased from 133 to 79 mu m, whereas the average sizes of the ' phases in the dendrite arms and the interdendritic regions decreased from 1.02 and 2.15 mu m to 0.69 and 1.26 mu m, respectively. Moreover, the ' phase distribution became more uniform. The microsegregation of Al, Ti, Cr, and Co decreased with the increase in the withdrawal rate; the segregation coefficients of Al, Cr, and Co approached 1 at higher withdrawal rates, whereas that of Ti remained above 2.2 at all the withdrawal rates.

TI Ni- and Co-BASED SUPERALLOYS AS POTENTIAL TOOL MATERIALS FOR
   THIXOFORMING OF STEELS
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MATERIAL FORMING
AB Thixoforming of steel is very demanding on tool materials. With process temperatures often exceeding 1300 degrees C, the surface-to-interior temperature gradients and the thermal stresses thus generated across the die are much larger than with Al and Mg. The principle die failure mechanism is thus claimed to be thermal fatigue as the mechanical loading on the tooling is modest owing to a mushy feedstock. The erosive wear caused by abrasion and impact of the already solid particles in the slurry and high temperature oxidation of the die surface, cannot be overlooked either. The conventional hot work tool steels were shown to rapidly deteriorate under such severe conditions. Suitable die materials with extended service life are required to set up an appropriate process for the production of steel parts on an industrial scale. Ni- and Co-based superalloys were tested in the present work for their potential to withstand the steel thixoforming environment for an economically acceptable life.

The impurity diffusion of W in gamma(Ni) is investigated using the five-frequency model. The diffusion coefficients and the diffusion activation energy of W are in reasonable agreement with the data in literatures. By W doping, the lattice misfit between the two phases decreases and the elastic constants of gamma'(Ni3Al) increase. As for alloyed elements Co, Re and W, the pinning effect of solute atom on the gamma(Ni)/gamma'(Ni3Al) misfit dislocation increases with the increasing of the atomic radius. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB Interim results from the development of a polycrystalline Co-Al-W based superalloy are presented. Cr has been added to provide oxidation resistance and Ni has then been added to widen and stabilise the gamma' phase field. The alloy presented has a solvus of 1010 degrees C and a density of 8.7 g cm(-3). The room temperature flow stress is over 1000 MPa and this reduces dramatically above 800 degrees C. The flow stress anomaly is observed. A microstructure with both similar to 50 nm gamma ' produced on cooling and larger 100-200 nm gamma ' can be obtained. Isothermal oxidation at 800 degrees C in air for 200 h gave a mass gain of 0.96 mg cm(-2). After hot deformation in the 650-850 degrees C temperature range, both anti phase boundaries (APBs) and stacking faults could be observed. An APB energy of 71 mJm(-2) was measured, which is comparable to that found in commercial nickel superalloys.

TI Brazing and wide gap repair of X-40 using Ni-base alloys
SO JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING FOR GAS TURBINES AND POWER-TRANSACTIONS OF THE
   ASME
AB Co-base superalloys are commonly used for vanes and parts of the combustion chamber in gas turbine engines. The Co-base superalloys are primarily solid solution strengthened and have good resistance to hot corrosion, creep, and thermal fatigue. In particular Co-base alloy X-40 was used to fabricate the first stage NGV airfoils of T56 series engines: inspections after service have revealed that X-40 airfoils suffered from severe thermal fatigue damages. In this study, a new braze repair scheme is proposed; in which Ni-base alloys are used to repair the X-40 substrate in both narrow and wide gap configurations. Metallographic examination, X-ray mapping, and energy dispersive Spectroscopy semiquantitative compositional analyses were carried out to study the microstructures in the braze joint in the as-brazed condition and after thermal exposure at 950 degrees C. The results obtained so far suggest the formation of Cr-rich borides, eutectic phases, and various carbides in the joint. No TCP phases were found in the brazed joint and base metals adjacent to the joint. The high carbon content in the alloy X-40 may have played an important role in preventing the formation of TCP phases,during brazing and subsequent thermal exposure.

TI Atom probe tomography investigation of the microstructure of superalloys

SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB Microstructural features of nickel base superalloys N18 have been investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), field emission gun-scanning electron microscopy (FEG-SEM), field ion microscopy (FIM), one-dimensional atom probe (APFIM) and three-dimensional atom probe (3DAP). Heat treatments conducted at 700 and 800 C lead to the precipitation of a large volume fraction of gamma precipitates (57%) that are Al and Ti enriched. Cr, Co and Mo preferentially partition to the gamma solid solution. Small Cr-enriched particles (0) were discovered in the core of largest gamma particles. These contain more Cr and less Mo than the gamma solid solution but are thought to be tiny metastable gamma particles that were formed in the inner region of gamma particles during cooling from 800 degreesC. Intergranular Ni-depleted borides arranged in "clusters" of particles very close to each other were observed using 3DAP. Their stoichiometry is M2B with M = Cr, Mo. One nanometer-thick Ni and Co enriched films (compared to borides) separate adjoining boride particles. Grain boundary (GB) segregation of B, Mo and to some extent Cr has been observed. The thickness of the segregated layer wetting GB is close to 1 nm. (C) 2002 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Design of advanced materials in general calls for better understanding of phase transitions at service temperatures and relevant equilibrium phase diagrams. In the case of multicomponent alloys, it is often necessary to study phase transformations on model systems. Ni-Al-Cr-X quaternary systems (X = Co, W, Ti, Ta, etc.) are relatively simple yet sufficiently representative models for Ni-base superalloys. However, their complete thermodynamic description requires qualified knowledge of thermodynamic parameters for lower order systems as well as higher order correction terms.
   This work continues our previous studies on Ni-Al-Cr-(Co, W, Mo) systems. This time it is focused on titanium as the fourth element. Experimental alloys were prepared with respect to gamma + gamma' phases presence and studied by means of analytical electron microscopy after annealing at typical service temperatures. Experimentally identified types of phases are compared with those obtained by means of thermodynamic calculations. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   superalloys
SO METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND
   MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB The creep behavior of two single-crystal nickel-base superalloys with [001] orientation has been studied by measuring the creep curves, internal friction stress of dislocation motion, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observation and energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX) composition analysis. The results show that over the stress and temperature range, there are different creep activation energies, time exponents, and effective stress exponents in two alloys at different creep stages. The size and volume fraction of the gamma' phase in the tantalum-free alloy is obviously decreased with the elevated temperature, This results in the decrease of the internal friction stress during steady-state creep. Higher levels of tungsten in the alloy result in a smaller strain value and lower directional-coarsening rate during primary creep. During steady-state creep, the primary reason for the better creep resistance of the other alloy is that it contains more Al and also Ta, which maintains a high volume fraction of gamma' phase. The dislocation climb over the gamma' rafts is the major deformation mechanisms during steady-state tensile creep. The fact that the strain rate is decreased with the increase of the size and volume fraction of the gamma' rafts may be described by a modified constitutive equation that is based on a model of the rate of dislocation motion.

TI Microstructure and oxidation behavior of Al plus Cr co-deposited
   coatings on nickel-based superalloys
SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB The microstructure and oxidation behavior were investigated in Al and Cr co-deposited diffusion coatings prepared by the pack cementation process. The composition (in wt.%) of the packs was 3NH(4)Cl-xAl-(25-x)Cr-72Al(2)O(3) with different Al levels (x = 0.5,1,2,4, and 10). After the heat-treatment process, the corresponding microstructure of the coatings was Cr + Cr2Ni3 + Al-rich phase, Cr + Cr2Ni3, Cr + NiAl + Ni3Al and NiAl + AlCr2, respectively. The isothermal oxidation tests were performed at 950 degrees C for up to 100 h in air, and the oxidation kinetic curves were obtained. It indicated that the coatings formed in the packs containing 1.2 wt.% Al had the lowest weight gain, while the weight gain of the coating formed in the packs having 4 wt.% Al was the largest. The presence of Cr in Al and Cr co-deposited coatings promotes Al2O3 generation. The formation mechanisms of Al + Cr co-deposited coatings and the effect of Cr in different types of coatings during the oxidation process were discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A comparison of oxidation behavior of this alloy with a conventional nickel-base superalloy (Inconel 713C) has been conducted in detail. This experimental alloy oxidizes by forming layers of Al2O3, Cr2O3, TiO2, CoO and traces of SiO2 with WO2 oxides on the surface of the specimen in contact with air. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to study the microstructure, morphology and compositions of oxides formed after the exposure. Thermal stability of the alloy after extended periods of exposures to air at 1000, 1100 and 1200 degrees C was studied using transmission electron microscopy (TEM).

AB A study of transient liquid-phase bonding (TLPB) of dissimilar materials consisting of a nickel-based superalloy and a cobalt material is performed. In contrast to the assumption that rapid atomic diffusion in the liquid would reduce the processing time, t (f), required to completely eliminate the liquid phase from the joint region through diffusional solidification, the occurrence of liquid-state diffusion significantly prolonged the processing time t (f). This finding is crucially important to the TLPB of dissimilar materials.

TI Exploration of crystal structure and the origin of unexpected intrinsic
   ductility of chi Co7Ta2
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB The precise information on phase constitutions in the Co-Ta system is of practical significance for exploiting g 0 gamma'-strengthened Co-Ta-based superalloys. The unidentified crystal structure of chi Co7Ta2 and the ambiguous description of phase relationship between chi Co7Ta2 and g gamma'Co3Ta result in the uncertainty of phase constitutions in the Co-rich region of Co-Ta. In this work, we present a systematical study of crystallographic data of Co7Ta2 on the basis of first principles and an unbiased structure searching method. A layered-sandwich structure with C2/m monoclinic symmetry (Pearson symbol mC18) is identified for Co7Ta2. The thermodynamic, mechanical and phonon calculations further verify the stability of C2/m. The quasi-harmonic thermodynamics exhibit that Co3Ta is stable and Co7Ta2 should be metastable at ambient temperature. The entropy effect remarkably stabilizes Co7Ta2 but destabilizes Co3Ta phase. The Co7Ta2 would be the thermodynamically stable at T >= 1200 K. Further results of mechanical properties show that Co7Ta2 yields an unexpected intrinsic ductility. Through the electronic configurations, it demonstrates that the ductility is associated with the bonding alteration in the specific layered-sandwich structure of Co7Ta2 during deformation process.

SO RARE METAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING
AB Mechanical properties and structure stability have been investigated on new Ni-Cr-Co base superalloys after long-term aging at 700degreesC by microstructure analysis and high temperature property measurement. Long time aging at 700degreesC, results in the precipitation of the carbides MC, M23C6 as well as gamma ' (gamma prime). The carbides MC and M23C6 remain stable up to 5 008 h aging. The gamma prime grows obviously and coarsenis by diffusion-controlled growth. After long time aging at 700degreesC the hardnees (measured at room temperature) does not change much initially and then decreases with further aging in resonse to changes in the size, morphology and distribution of gamma prime. The high temperature tensile strength and the stress rupture for the tested alloy were considerably higher than Nimonic 263. In brief, the new alloys maintain a stable structure at 700degreesC and exhibit improved high-temperature properties.

AB The Al/W ratio was increased in a new polycrystalline gamma/gamma' Co-based superalloy in order to introduce a grain boundary pinning phase while at the same time reducing the density and increasing the oxidation resistance. The grain boundary pinning phase was identified as beta-phase (B2-(Ni,Co)Al) by high-energy X-ray diffraction. The grain boundary pinning effect was confirmed to be effective up to temperatures of 1050 degrees C by synchrotron radiation in-situ heating experiments. The precipitation of the beta phase led to a reduced gamma' volume fraction thereby decreasing the high-temperature strength. The density was lowered to 8.52 g/cm(3), so the specific strength was equivalent to the strength of the reference alloy up to 750 degrees C. Due to the low gamma' volume fraction and the low W content, the creep resistance was also reduced compared with the reference alloy. The oxidation resistance, however, was improved by the formation of a thin, continuous Al-oxide layer during oxidation at 900 degrees C for 50 hours.

   superalloy
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB The partitioning behaviors of alloying elements Cr, Co, Al, Ta, etc. on the gamma and gamma' phases of high Cr-containing (similar to 9wt.%) nickel-base single crystal superalloys have been investigated with and without the addition of 3wt.% Ru. The "reverse partitioning effect" occurs, which means that the addition of Ru causes the partition of Cr and Co into gamma' phase, while Al an Ta concentrate into gamma matrix. However, Ru promotes the precipitation of topologically close-packed (TCP) phases, since the diffusion coefficient between the TCP phase and the matrix interface increases with the diffusion behaviors of refractory elements. For the coarsening and slightly rafting of gamma' phases, the increase of elemental diffusion plays much more important role in its kinetic process than the decrease of lattice misfit.

SO JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB The isothermal oxidation behavior of experimental third and fourth generation Ni-based superalloys was studied at temperatures between 900 and 1100 degrees C. It was found that the lower Cr concentration in third and fourth generation alloys compared to second generation alloys negatively affects the ability of the alloy to form and maintain a protective alumina scale especially at lower temperatures (900 degrees C). An extensive internal reaction zone comprised of oxide and nitride phases is observed underneath a nonprotective external oxide scale. At higher temperatures, a continuous alumina scale forms underneath (Ni,Co)O and spinel layers. Due to the low level of reactive element (RE) additions in these experimental alloys, scale adhesion is poor. An increase of Cr content is necessary to ensure formation of a protective alumina scale at lower temperatures. Addition of Y and/or Zr is recommended for improved oxide adhesion, resulting in better overall oxidation performance. (C) 2010 The Electrochemical Society.

The resulting APR is of high quality too. Powdery metal rhenium might be produced from this APR by means of its high-temperature reduction by gaseous hydrogen. The purity of obtained metallic rhenium is generally determined by purity of APR applied.

The experiments were carried out at temperatures 700 degrees C, 800 degrees C and 900 degrees C for different exposure times to up to 100 h. The corrosive media was NaCl and Na2SO4 sprayed on the specimens. Seven different specimens were used at each temperature. The corrosion process is endothermic and the spontaneity increased by increasing temperature. The activation energy was found to be Ea = 23.54 and E-a = 25.18 Kj/mol for Inconel 738 and Inconel 617 respectively. X-ray diffraction technique (XRD) was used to analyze the formed scale. The morphology of the specimen and scale were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results show that the major corrosion products formed were NiCr2O4, and Co Cr2O4 spinles, in addition to Cr2O3. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Optimum microstructure combination for maximizing tensile strength in a
   polycrystalline superalloy with a two-phase structure
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB Different microstructural features were obtained under various heat treatment conditions, which provided insight into the factors controlling the critical strength in a polycrystalline Ni-Co-based disk superalloy (TMW-4M3 alloy) with a two-phase structure. The contribution of each microstructural feature, namely, the grain size, annealing twin boundary and distribution of gamma' precipitates, to the total strength was analyzed quantitatively by measuring the Vickers hardness over the nanometer to micron size range. Grain boundary strengthening decreased to nearly zero with increasing solution heat treatment temperature, while the secondary and tertiary gamma' precipitation hardening increased. Therefore, there is an optimum combination of microstructural features for achieving the highest tensile strength in such superalloys, the key factors being the temperature and time used for the solution heat treatment and the subsequent aging treatment. A method for determining the optimum factors for TMW-4M3 is proposed. (C) 2012 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI On the Role of Superlattice Structures with Ni3X-type Composition in
   Selected Ni-Based Superalloys with Commercial Grades
SO METALLOGRAPHY MICROSTRUCTURE AND ANALYSIS
AB Close-packed superlattice derivatives of the face-centered cubic (fcc) structure with Ni3X-type composition in some commercial Ni-based superalloys have been characterized, and their effect on tensile strength has been determined. Both the L1(2) and DO22 superlattices can form directly from the fcc structure by minor atoms rearrangement. However, the two superlattices can act as transient metastable phases which transform into more stable superlattices (L1(2) -> DO24 and DO22 -> D0(a)) with extended thermal exposure at elevated temperatures. It is shown that the stability and morphology of each superlattice are dependent upon the alloy composition. Although some superlattices produce adverse effects on tensile strength, others are found to have beneficial effects. The exact effect is correlated with the particular morphology and deformation mode. It is concluded that the DO22 superlattice can form the basis for designing alloys deformable by twinning and combine high strength and high ductility.

TI Solidification Reaction Sequence of Co-Rich Nb-Al-Co Alloys
SO METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND
   MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB The freezing reaction sequence of Co-rich Nb-Al-Co ternary alloys with emphasis on the formation of Laves and Heusler phases has been examined. For Co-rich alloys, the solidification reaction sequence is observed as primary freezing of alpha-Co and CoAl phases, subsequent [Co + C36] and [CoAl + C36] eutectics, and the final ternary eutectic reaction [L -> alpha-Co + C36 + CoAl]. The compositions of solidified alpha-Co and C36 phases agree with the corresponding vertices of the tie-triangle at the solidus temperatures. When the Nb concentration is over 20 at. pct in Co-rich alloys, the quasi-peritectic reaction [L + Co2AlNb -> C36 + CoAl] does not occur as equilibrium prediction. The formation of C36 and CoAl phases occurs through solid precipitation and must be distinguished from a solidification reaction.

The results show that: (1) no ternary compound exists in the isothermal sections from 1000 to 1200 degrees C; (2) the phases of CoTi and TiRu form the continuous solid solution phase (Co,Ru)Ti; (3) the solubility of Ru in the Co3Ti phase is less than 5 at.% at isothermal sections 1000-1100 degrees C. These experimental results will provide useful information for the foundation for alloy design and the supplement for thermodynamic databases.

SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Single-crystal elastic constants of Co-3(Al, W) with cubic L1(2) structure have been experimentally measured by resonance ultrasound spectroscopy at liquid helium temperature. The values of all three independent single-crystal elastic constants and polycrystalline elastic constants of Co-3(Al, W) experimentally determined are 15%-25% larger than those of Ni-3(Al, Ta) but are considerably smaller than previously calculated values of the constants. When judged from the values of Poisson's ratio, Cauchy pressure, and G(h)/B-h, the ductility of Co-3(Al, W) is expected to be sufficiently high so that Co-3(Al, W) can be practically used as the constituent phase of "Co-base superalloys."

Nickel and cobalt base superalloys and iron base stainless steels were tested in different combinations, and their wear rates compared to determine optimal wear resistance. The results show that an alloy's wear resistance is highly dependent on operating temperature and its coupling with another material. The influences of friction, hardness, and oxide formation on the alloy's wear resistance are also presented and discussed.

TI High temperature corrosion behaviour of some Fe-, Co- and Ni-base
   superalloys in the presence of Y2O3 as inhibitor
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB High temperature corrosion is accelerated degradation of materials at higher temperatures of operation caused by the presence of a deposit of salt or ash. Inhibitors and fuel additives have been investigated with varying success to control this type of corrosion. In this work, effect of an oxide additive namely Y2O3 on the hot corrosion behaviour of some superalloys viz Superfer 800H (alloy A), Superco 605 (alloy B) and Superni 75 (alloy C) has been investigated in an Na2SO4-60%V2O5 environment at 900 degrees C for 50 cycles. Each cycle consisted of 1 h heating in a Silicon Carbide Tube Furnace followed by 20 min cooling in ambient air. Weight data were taken by an electronic balance having an accuracy of 0.01 mg after each cycle. Subsequently, the exposed alloys were characterized by XRD, SEM and EPMA analyses to evaluate the role of the oxide additive. In the Na2SO4-60%V2O5 environment, the corrosion rate for the Co-base alloy was found to be highest, whereas that for the Ni-base Superni 75 the lowest. Superficially applied Y2O3 was observed to be useful in reducing the high temperature corrosion of the alloys. It was found to be most effective for the alloy A for which the oxide scale was continuous and rich in protective Cr. Alloy B showed the formation of medium size scale rich in Cr and Co. The oxide scale for the alloy C contained mainly Cr and Ni. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

Cross-sectional TEM analyses showed the presence of precipitates in the coating. This precipitate was identified as the hexagonal topologically close-packed (TCP) mu phase with lattice parameters a = 0.473 nm and c = 2.565 nm. The energy-dispersive x-ray (EDX) spectrum of the mu phase suggested a refractory element rich compound comprising the elements Re, W, and Co. Twin domains parallel to (001) were found in the mu phase. The mechanisms of the mu phase and twinning formation were discussed.

AB In order to obtain more knowledge to replace or lower the content of expensive and heavy elements Re and Ru in advanced Ni-based single crystal superalloys, the role of Ru playing in the microstructure and creep performance at 1100 degrees C and 140 MPa was evaluated in this study by considering its individual effect and also synergizing it with Mo to maximize the beneficial effect from each element. A series of single crystal superalloys with varying alloying elements were investigated and their initial microstructure and microstructural evolution during the creep deformation were characterized. It was shown that both Mo and Ru could increase the gamma/gamma' lattice misfit and density of interfacial dislocations, that contributed to improve the creep resistance at high temperature and low stress condition. The inferior microstructural stability regarding to the TCP phase formation in alloys with more Mo addition lowered creep performance to some extent, however, that could be restrained by the addition of Ru. The high temperature and low stress creep performance could be enhanced by the co-addition of Mo and Ru since their synergistic effect could be able to enhance the gamma/gamma' interfacial strengthening and retain the microstructural stability.

AB In this study, different amounts of fine TiC powders (0, 10, 15 and 20 mass%) were mixed and added to cobalt-based alloy powders. Then, the mixed composite materials (cobalt-based alloy and TiC powders) were vacuum sintered at 1260, 1270, 1280 and 1290 degrees C for 1 h, respectively. The experimental results showed that the highest TRS value of 1485.1MPa was obtained by the addition of 15 mass% TiC powder and sintering at 1280 degrees C for 1 h; while the highest hardness value of HRA 80.4 was obtained by 20 mass% TiC powder sintered at 1290 degrees C for 1 h. In addition, two types of carbide precipitates appeared in the microstructure. Without added TiC powder of the specimen, fine plate-like precipitates of M6C and M23C6 carbides were obvious on the grain boundary; but when TiC powder was added to the specimens, only M23C6 carbides were observed after sintering treatment. The result also showed that a suitable amount of TiC additive (15 mass%) effectively inhibits carbide precipitation and growth.

AB In this work, 2 at% Mo, 2 at% Nb and 2 at% Hf were substituted for the same amount of W into a Co-9Al-9W-2Ta-0.02B alloy (hereafter referred as to 2Mo, 2Nb and 2Hf alloys, respectively, while the original alloy is denoted as 0Me alloy). The effect of the Mo, Hf and Nb additions on the isothermal oxidation resistance, oxide scale evolution and failure mechanism, of the Co-9Al-9W-2Ta-0.02B alloy when exposed at 800 degrees C and 900 degrees C for 100 h was investigated. It was found the Mo, Hf and Nb additions degraded the oxidation resistance of the Co-9Al-9W-2Ta-0.02B alloy, while the 2Mo alloy always displayed the poorest oxidation resistance, resulted from heavy spallation of the oxide scale. An oxide scale composed of an outer Co3O4+CoO layer, a middle complex oxide layer enriched with Al, W and Ta, and gamma/needle-like Co3W zone adhering to the gamma/gamma' substrate was gradually formed; moreover, a continuous or discontinuous Al2O3 layer and dispersive Al2O3 dots or slices were observed within the gamma/needle-like Co3W zone, depending on the oxidation temperature and added elements (Mo, Hf and Nb). The formation of volatile MoO3 in the oxide scale of the 2Mo alloy enhance the exfoliation of the oxide products, resulting in severe spallation and poor oxidation resistance.

AB Cobalt-based superalloys, Stellite 694 and Stellite 712, composites were developed with the reinforcement of titanium-carbide particles for wear-resistant applications. The specimens were fabricated using the powder metallurgy technique, combined with hot isostatic pressing. Calorimetric effects of the alloy powders were investigated using the differential scanning calorimetry technique, which provided the theoretical basis of designing the sintering cycles. The phases formed in the microstructures were analyzed using the scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectrum (EDS) techniques. The wear test was conducted on a ball-on-disc tribometer. It was demonstrated that the wear resistance of the alloys had been increased significantly by the titanium-carbide reinforcement and the hot isostatic pressing process had enhanced the wear resistance of the materials.

TI ALLOYING EFFECTS ON HEAT-TREATED MICROSTRUCTURE IN CO-AL-W-BASE

AB Two levels of non-refractory (V and Ti) and refractory (Mo, Nb and Ta) alloying elements were added to Co-9Al-10W ternary alloy (at.%, baseline alloy) in order to investigate alloying effects on phase equilibria, microstructural features of gamma' phase and secondary phases at 1300 degrees C and 900 degrees C, respectively. It is suggested that refractory alloying additions promoted the precipitation of the mu phase at 1300 degrees C. The phase equilibria changed from gamma single-phase region in the baseline alloy to gamma+mu two-phase region in quaternary alloys containing high levels of refractory alloying elements (4 at.%) at 1300 degrees C. The mu phase was enriched in W, Mo, Nb and Ta, but depleted in AI, V and Ti. For quaternary alloys with low levels of alloying additions (2 at.%), the gamma/gamma' two-phase microstructure was observed after aging treatment at 900 degrees C for 50h and 300h, but small amounts of the plate-like DO19 phase precipitated in the matrix of 2Mo and 2Nb alloys. The volume fractions of the gamma' phase were at very high level in the range of 74% to 83% in all these experimental alloys. Compared with the baseline alloy, alloying additions did not show the strong effect on gamma' morphology, which remained cuboidal after long term aging except Mo addition. For quaternary alloys with high levels of alloying additions after aging at 900 degrees C, the DO19 phase precipitated in addition to gamma and gamma' phases, as well as the blocky mu phase inherited from the precipitation at 1300 degrees C. There were two types of the DO19 phase: one was plate-like and precipitated in the matrix; the other was blocky and transformed from the previous mu phase. Again, refractory alloying additions (Mo, Nb and Ta) promoted phase transformation for both types of the DO19 phase. The current study is helpful to understand phase equilibria and microstructure in Co-Al-W-base alloys and further develop multi-component gamma'-strengthened Co-base superalloys.

TI Atomic size effect of alloying elements on the formation, evolution and
   strengthening of gamma'-Ni3Al precipitates in Ni-based superalloys
SO INTERMETALLICS
AB Mechanical properties of Ni-based superalloys strongly depend on phase and site preferences of alloying elements which influence bonding strength within gamma'-Ni3Al precipitates and microstructural characteristics of these unique class of materials. In the current work, therefore, besides disclosure of the phase partitioning behaviours of alloying X elements (i.e. X = Co, Cr, Nb, Ta or Ti) among gamma' and gamma phases, their site occupancy tendencies in gamma' precipitates (determined via first-principles ab initio calculations at 0 K) and effects on the microstructural evolution of Ni80Al15X5 alloy systems (exposed to aging at 800 degrees C for 4, 16, 64 and 256 h, respectively) have been examined. Bonding features of Ni-Al, Ni-X and Al-X atomic pairs within Ni3Al-X intermetallics have been simulated by utilizing charge density difference (CDD) method, which reveals site preferences of alloying X elements as well. Present theoretical and experimental investigations have shown that mechanical strength of Nibased superalloys is predominantly affected by bonding properties within precipitates. As atomic radii of alloying X elements become closer to that of Al atom, energy change parameter, E-Ni -> Al(X) values decrease and more Al sublattice sites are preferentially occupied in gamma' precipitates. Correspondingly, bonding strength of Ni-X atomic pairs along < 110 > directions of Ni3Al-X phases and micro-hardness properties of both as-cast and pre aged Ni80Al15X5 alloy systems enhance in the order of X = Co < Cr < Ti < Nb < Ta additions. Nevertheless, with increasing aging time, mechanical strength of alloys weakens in parallel with increasing size of gamma' precipitates simultaneously evolved from near-spherical to irregular forms.

TI Interdiffusion and related atomic mobilities in fcc Cu-Fe-Co alloys
SO CALPHAD-COMPUTER COUPLING OF PHASE DIAGRAMS AND THERMOCHEMISTRY
AB Diffusion couples for fcc Cu-Fe-Co ternary system are prepared, all of which are annealed at 1573 K for 50 h. Interdiffusion coefficients are evaluated at the intersection points of two independent diffusion paths sharing a common composition. Such main and cross interdiffusion coefficients are then used to inversely retrieve atomic mobilities of Cu, Fe and Co in fcc Cu-Fe-Co alloys, with the aid of available thermodynamic description. Further validation concerning the quality of atomic mobilities is conducted with computational simulations for diffusion couples, the results of which are compared with experimental data. This work contributes to the establishment of a general Co-based kinetic database for computational design of superalloys. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   ' Co-Ti-based superalloys
SO INTERMETALLICS
AB Three compositions of Re containing Co-Ti-based alloys with gamma/gamma' two-phase microstructure were obtained based on the determined phase relationship in the Co-rich corner at 800 degrees C. The effect of Re on microstructure, elemental partition behavior, thermodynamic properties, lattice parameter misfits, mechanical properties and gamma' coarsening behavior of the Co-Ti-Re alloys were investigated. The gamma/gamma' lattice parameter misfit of the alloys decreases from 0.72% to 0.50%, and the gamma' coarsening rate constant K of alloys decreases from 0.30 x 10(-27) m(3) s(-1) to 0.073 x 10(-27) m(3) s(-1) as Re content increasing form 1 at. % to 5 at. %. Additionally, the volume fraction of gamma' phase (V-gamma') increases from 42.15% to 53.19% and the gamma' solvus temperature increases from 1059 degrees C to 1085 degrees C (Tsolvus-gamma') with increasing Re content. Moreover, the 0.2% flow stresses and the 0.2% specific flow stresses of all three alloys exhibit negative temperature dependence at the temperatures ranging from room temperature to 900 degrees C. And both the 0.2% flow stresses and the 0.2% specific flow stresses increase with the Re content.

TI ELASTIC ENERGY CHANGES ACCOMPANYING GAMMA-PRIME RAFTING IN NICKEL-BASE
   SUPERALLOYS
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS RESEARCH
AB Eshelby's equivalent inclusion method is applied to the case of a single, inhomogeneous, ellipsoidal precipitate in an infinite matrix to study the morphological changes of the gamma-prime precipitates in nickel-base superalloys due to the influence of lattice constant misfit, elastic inhomogeneity and anisotropy, applied stress, and interfacial energy.  The energy-minimizing inclusion shapes depend very sensitively on the degree of elastic inhomogeneity, on the sense and magnitude of the applied stress, and on the sense of the lattice constant misfit.  The interfacial energy contribution can dominate that of elastic strain energy for small precipitate sizes, elastically compliant systems, nearly homogeneous alloys, and/or nearly isotropic materials.  Calculations are carried out for two well-characterized nickel-base alloys:  a Ni-13.5Al alloy (positive misfit, elastically hard inclusions) studied by Miyazaki et al. and CMSX-3 (negative misfit, elastically soft inclusions) studied by Pollock.  The Eshelby energy calculations correctly predict the precipitate morphologies observed by Miyazaki et al. and by Pollock.

CY NOV, 1994

AB The Monte Carlo method was applied to the simulation of temporal evolutions of atomic arrangement in Ni-base superalloys. The ordering kinetics was controlled by direct exchange of a randomly selected single atom with one of its neighbouring atoms. The formation of gamma' phase gamma'/gamma equilibrium and substitutional behaviours of alloying elements were predicted by the model. The reductions of total energy normalized by initial energy by ordering are about 3%, for superalloys CMSX-4 and about 2% for TMS63. The formation and coarsening rates of gamma' phase in CMSX-4 are higher than those in TMS63. The size distribution profiles for CMSX-4 and TMS63 approach time-invariant profiles. The variations of calculated phase composition of gamma' and gamma phases of CMSX-4 and TMS63 with time are not significant. The enrichment of Al, Ti and Ta in gamma' phase and Co and gamma phase is observed. Cr is partitioning into both gamma' and gamma phases. This qualitatively agrees with the phase analysis of Ni-Al-Ti ternary alloys by cluster variation method. The variations of calculated concentration of alloying element in Ni and Al sublattices of gamma' phase in CMSX-4 and TMS63 with lime are not significant. The preferential substitutions of Ti, Mo and Ta in Al sublattice and Co in Ni sublattice are predicted. Cr is entering into both Ni and Al sublattices. The tendency of site occupation predicted by the simulation is consistent with the classification given by Enomoto and Harada. The Monte Carlo simulation results on site occupancies of alloying elements of CMSX-4 and TMS63 are in good agreement with those observed by atom probe FIM analysis and then calculated by the cluster variation method except for Ni concentration in the Al sublattice.

TI IN-SITU ELECTRICAL-RESISTIVITY MEASUREMENTS FOR DETERMINING FORMATION
   KINETICS OF GAMMA' PHASE IN NICKEL-BASED WROUGHT SUPERALLOYS
SO ZEITSCHRIFT FUR METALLKUNDE
AB Formation kinetics of gamma (Ni3Al) phase in Ni-based wrought superalloys were investigated using the indirect measurement method of electrical resistivity change during isothermal holding.
   It was found that formation of gamma' phase occurs in a very short time (as a function of temperature and alloying level) by a diffusion controlled nucleation mechanism. Al alone enhances the formation of gamma' nuclei in the alloy and enlarges their quantity. On the other hand, addition of Ti or Ta causes delay in nucleation. Any other alloying addition (e.g. Co or W) delays the primary stage of nucleation. Ta was found to be more substantial than Ti in increasing nucleation rate and volume fraction of the gamma' phase.

TI Phase evolution and crystallography of precipitates during decomposition
   of new "tungsten-free" Co(Ni)-Mo-Al-Nb gamma-gamma ' superalloys at
   elevated temperatures
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB This article reports the microstructural stability and consequent phase decomposition including the appearance of topologically close-packed (TCP) phases at high temperature of recently discovered tungsten-free gamma-gamma' alloys of base composition Co-10Al-5Mo-2Nb with or without the addition of Ni and Ti. On prolonged aging at 800 degrees C of the Co-10Al-5Mo-2Nb alloy, needle-shaped DO19-ordered precipitates with stoichiometry of Co-3(Mo, Nb) start appearing in the microstructure. In addition, growth of cellular domains from the grain boundaries featuring a three-phase composite lamellar structure could be observed. These phases are fcc gamma-Co with composition different from the original matrix, CoAl with B2 ordering and Co-3(Mo, Nb) with DO19 ordering. All the phases exhibit well-defined crystallographic orientation relationships. The decomposition of the alloys depends on the solvus temperature of the gamma' phase. The Ni-containing alloy exhibits no phase decomposition until 100 h of aging at 800 degrees C without any significant effect on gamma' volume fraction (76 %). However, at 950 degrees C, the alloy decomposes leading to the appearance of four different phases including TCP phases: a Cr3Si-type cubic phase, a hexagonal Laves phase, rhombohedral mu phase, and solid solution of Co phase. The gamma-gamma' microstructure in the Co-10Al-5Mo-2Nb and Co-30Ni-10Al-5Mo-2Ta alloys is not stable at 800 and 950 degrees C, respectively, on long-term aging. This shows that the measured solvus temperatures (i.e., 866 and 990 degrees C) are metastable solvus temperatures. We also report that the Ti-containing alloy exhibits superior stability with no evidence of either TCP phase formation or any other decomposition of gamma' precipitates, even after aging at 950 degrees C for 100 h.

AB The effects of mismatch in atomic size and electronegativity of alloying elements on the elemental concentration of sublattices of gamma' phase in Ni base superalloys were investigated. The mathematic model of optimizations was established to predict the elemental concentration of sublattices of gamma' phase. Ranges of the selected values of concentration variables were determined by use of the iterative and substitutional method. Based on chemical compositions of the gamma' phase, the elemental content at the Ni and Al sites in the gamma' phase can be calculated with the layered multi-objective optimization algorithm with tolerance. Using the reported data on both the chemical compositions and the lattice parameters of gamma' phase, a comparison between the predicted and the reported values of lattice parameters was made through the application of the predicted values of the elemental concentrations of the gamma' sublattices to verify the feasibility and the accuracy of the present method.

SO ARCHIVES OF METALLURGY AND MATERIALS
AB Cobalt based heat - resisting superalloys are widely used for turbine blades and stationary elements of gas turbines (combustion space and stator blades) in acro-engines. These elements are generally produced by the investment casting method. The use of cobalt aluminate (CoAl2O4) for reducing relative;rain size of precision investment castings results in higher mechanical properties. The aim of the present work was settlement of basic physical and chemical properties of cobalt aluminate powder and its concentration in the interior surface of invested mould on the grain size and the microstructure, and in consequence, mechanical properties of high temperature creep resisting superalloy MAR M 509. For this purpose. file ceramic moulds were made with different kinds oh cobalt aluminate (manufactured by two different companies: Mason Color and Permedia Lublin) and its concentration in the primary slurry was from 0 to 10% mass. in zirconium flour. Stepped and cylindrical samples were casted for microstructure and mechanical examinations. The average grain size of the matrix (gamma phase). was determined on the stepped samples. The influence of surface modification on the grain size of tip to section thickness was considered. The microstructure investigations with the use of light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) enable to examine the influence of the surface modification on the morphology of carbides precipitations. Verification of the influence of CoAl2O4 on the mechanical properties of castings were investigated on the basis of results obtained form tensile and creep tests.

Up to now, there has been few report on the density of molten Ni-Co alloy. In order to obtain more accurate density data for molten Ni-Co alloy, the density of molten Ni-Co alloy was measured with a modified sessile drop method, and the accommodation of different atoms in molten Ni-Co alloy was analyzed. The density of alloy is found to decrease with increasing temperature and Co concentration in the alloy. The molar volume of molten Ni-Co alloy increases with increasing Co concentration. The molar volume of Ni-Co alloy determined shows a positive deviation from the linear molar volume, and the deviation of molar volume from ideal mixing increases with increasing Co concentration over the experimental concentration range.

AB The Al-Co-Ni system is essential to both Co-and Ni-based superalloys. In this study phase relationships among Al, L1(2) and B2 at 800 degrees C have been investigated by using equilibrated alloys. Four samples were prepared and annealed at 800 degrees C for 14 days. SEM-EDXS and XRD were used to analyze the annealed samples. The results indicated that two-phase L1(2)+ B2 and three-phase Al + L1(2)+ B2 regions exit.
   A thermodynamic reassessment of the entire Al-Co-Ni system has been made according to the CALPHAD method. Compared to the previous assessments, more recent experimental results have been considered. In the Al-Co binary system, the phase named Y-Co4Al13 has been added on the basis of the available literature. The order-disorder model has been adopted to describe the Al/L1(2) and A(2)/B-2 phase relations, respectively. Three ternary compounds in the Al-rich region have been introduced. Three-sublattice model has been selected to describe the tau phase with a considerable solubility extension. Thermodynamic interaction parameters have been optimized, considering the available experimental data. In this work several diagrams were calculated, which can fit experimental results in the whole composition range. A satisfactory agreement was obtained. As a result phase equilibria in the interested ferromagnetic shape memory alloys are calculated.

AB The solidification behaviour of four nickel-base superalloys has been studied using the technique of quenched directional solidification.  Three of the alloys are designed for use as single crystals whereas the fourth, MAR-M002, is used in directionally solidified form.  Freezing begins in all alloys with the formation of gamma-Ni dendrites and is terminated by a gamma + gamma' eutectic reaction.  In MAR-M002, MC-type carbides form, with a Chinese-script morphology, in the interdendritic liquid behind the dendrite tips.  Phase transformation temperatures were measured, together with the evolution of fraction solid with temperature.  The behaviour of MAR-M002 is significantly more complex than that of the single-crystal alloys.  Primary and secondary dendrite arm spacings correlate with solidification parameters and are relatively insensitive to alloy constitution.  Measurements of elemental partitioning at the start of freezing show that aluminium, hafnium, molybdenum, tantalum and titanium always segregate to the liquid, cobalt and vanadium segregate to the dendrite core, and the segregation direction of chromium and tungsten depends on alloy constitution.

SO MATERIALS AT HIGH TEMPERATURES
AB To meet materials challenges encountered in gas turbines, superalloys have been developed for high temperature, strength, oxidation and corrosion resistance. One strengthening method is using refractory metal additions to form carbide precipitates. However, such precipitates may be detrimental to the alloy's environmental resistance. This paper reports how refractory metal carbide precipitates affect the early stages of oxidation and hot corrosion of two alloys: Rene 80 (nickel-based) and MarM 509 (cobalt-based). Samples were exposed at 700 degrees C in either dry synthetic air or 90 ppm SOx , 10.5% CO2 , 8.5% O-2 5% H2O (balance N) with a 80/20 (Na/ K)(2) SO4 deposit (1.5 mu g/cm(2)/hour flux). The oxidation morphology and corrosion products were investigated by scanning electron microscope and energy dispersive X-ray analysis, to show that refractory metal carbide precipitates close to the metal surfaces disrupt protective oxide scale formation, thus providing inward transport routes for corrosive species.

TI The effect of alloyed nickel on the short-term high temperature
   oxidation behaviour of Co-Re-Cr-based alloys
SO CORROSION SCIENCE
AB The effect of Ni on the oxidation behaviour of the alloy Co-17Re-23Cr (at.%) is studied. The results show that the alloying of 15 at.% Ni improves the alloy oxidation resistance significantly by promoting the formation of a protective Cr2O3 layer. This effect can be attributed at least partially to the enhancement of Cr diffusion by Ni in the metallic Co-Re-Cr-Ni matrix. Moreover, the formation of relatively slow growing Co(Ni)O solid-solution in the transient stage supports the lateral growth of Cr2O3 nuclei and thus accelerates the establishment of the compact chromia layer.

TI Partitioning behavior of platinum group metals into y and y ' phases of
   Ni-base superalloys
SO JOURNAL OF THE JAPAN INSTITUTE OF METALS
AB The partitioning behavior of platinum group metals (PGM) into gamma matrix and gamma' precipitates for gamma' precipitation hardening Ni-base superalloys has been investigated using electron probe X-ray micro-analyzer (EPMA). The TMS-75 (Ni-12 mass% Co-3 mass% Cr-2 mass% Mo-6 mass% W-6 mass% Al-6 mass% Ta-5 mass% Re-0.1 mass% Hf) and five alloys with 1 at% PGM additions to TMS-75 were investigated. It became clear that in equilibrium state at 1100degreesC, It is slightly partitioned more into gamma' precipitates, Ru has a preference to partition into gamma matrix, in contrast Rh, Pd and Pt are partitioned into gamma' precipitates, and the partitioning ratio of these elements is about K-i(gamma/gamma) approximate to 1/2. Furthermore, it appears that the partitioning behavior of refractory elements, such as W, Re, are not so changed by PGM addition, for example, Re is partitioned into gamma matrix in any alloy (K-Re(gamma/gamma) is in range of 6 to 7.5).

TI Development of a diffusion mobility database for Ni-base superalloys
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB For the fcc phase of the Ni-Al-Co-Cr-Hf-Mo-Re-Ta-Ti-W system, diffusion data in various constituent binary systems were assessed to establish a multicomponent diffusion mobility database. The diffusion assessment relied on an existing thermodynamic database for the calculation of needed thermodynamic factors. The mobilities determined for the self-diffusion of the components in the fcc phase (a metastable state for some components) were consistent with the correlation of the diffusivity with the melting point. The general agreement of calculated and measured diffusion coefficients in the Ni-Co-Cr-Mo and Ni-Al-Cr-Mo quaternary systems demonstrated the ability of the database to extrapolate to higher order systems. Finally, the mobility database, in conjunction with an available thermodynamic database and a finite-difference diffusion code. was used to simulate a multicomponent diffusion couple between two commercial Ni-base superalloys.

SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB Ni-Co-Cr-Al-Y-Si-B coatings were deposited on Ni base superalloys DZ125 and DSM11 by arc ion plating (AIP). The corrosion behaviours of DZ125, DSM11 and Ni-Co-Cr-Al-Y-Si-B coating in molten 75%Na2SO4+25%K2SO4 at 900 degreesC were studied. The results indicate that the coating can protect the DZ125 and DSM11 alloys from hot corrosion destruction due to the formation of a continuous and dense alpha-Al2O3 scale. In the last stage of the hot corrosion process, the hot corrosion behaviours of base alloys have important influences on behaviours of the whole systems.

TI CORRELATION OF TA/W-COMPOSITIONAL RATIOS WITH THE HIGH-TEMPERATURE
   PROPERTIES OF NI-CR-AL-TA-W(-CO) SINGLE-CRYSTAL SUPERALLOYS
SO TETSU TO HAGANE-JOURNAL OF THE IRON AND STEEL INSTITUTE OF JAPAN
AB The optimum Ta/W compositional ratio was searched for in Ni-10/11 mol% Cr-12/14 mol% Al-Ta-W(-5 mol% Co) alloys in order to get an excellent combination of creep-rupture, phase stability and hot-corrosion resistance in a Na2SO4-NaCl salt.  Solidification and precipitation temperatures were also examined as a function of the Ta/W ratio.  The gamma' solvus temperature and the creep-rupture life were found to increase with increasing Ta/W ratio up to 1.0.  However, when the ratio exceeded 1.0, the creep-rupture life reversely decreased probably due to the increase in the residual amount of the eutectic gamma' phase in alloys.  On the other hand, hot-corrosion resistance increased monotonously with the Ta/W ratio.  From the present study it was concluded that the Ta/W compositional ratio of 0.5 to 1.0 was most suitable for balancing the high temperature properties in this alloy system.

TI Compositional variations for small-scale gamma prime (gamma ')
   precipitates formed at different cooling rates in an advanced Ni-based
   superalloy
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB Size-dependent compositional variations under different cooling regimes have been investigated for ordered L1(2)-structured gamma prime (gamma') precipitates in the commercial powder metallurgy Ni-based superalloy RR1000. Using scanning transmission electron microscope imaging combined with absorption-corrected energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, we have discovered large differences in the Al, Ti and Co compositions for gamma' precipitates in the size range 10-300 nm. Our experimental results, coupled with complementary thermodynamic calculations, demonstrate the importance of kinetic factors on precipitate composition in Ni-based superalloys. In particular, these results provide new evidence for the role of elemental diffusion kinetics and aluminium antisite atoms on the low-temperature growth kinetics of fine-scale gamma' precipitates. Our findings have important implications for understanding the microstructure and precipitation behaviour of Ni-based superalloys, suggesting a transition in the mechanism of vacancy-mediated diffusion of Al from intrasublattice exchange at high temperatures to intersublattice antisite-assisted exchange at low temperatures.

AB The influence of gamma precipitates on the deformation behavior of gamma' Ni3Al nanocubes with {100} side surfaces is investigated by molecular dynamics simulations of uniaxial compression tests at 300 K. The plastic deformation of the nanocubes is caused by the nucleation of Shockley partial dislocations near the cube corners followed by the formation of pseudo-twins. While the dominant deformation mechanisms and the flow stress are not affected by the presence of precipitates, the precipitates reduce the yield stress by up to 10 pct and determine the location of dislocation nucleation. These findings can be rationalized by accounting for the misfit stresses caused by the presence of the gamma precipitates. Within the simulated ranges, the results are independent of cube size, rounding of the cube or precipitate corners, surface roughness, and strain rate. The observed precipitate softening in the dislocation-nucleation-controlled deformation of gamma' NiAl nanocubes is in stark contrast to the strengthening effect caused by the presence of a gamma phase in the gamma' precipitates in the microstructure of typical Ni- and Co-based superalloys.

AB In the present study, a Co1.5CrFeNi1.5Ti0.5 high-entropy alloy has been investigated for its high-temperature microstructural stability. This material is shown to possess mainly a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure; the eta phase is present at the interdendritic region in the as-cast condition, and it is stable between 1073 K and 1273 K (800 degrees C and 1000 degrees C); gamma' particles are found throughout the microstructures below 1073 K (800 degrees C). Segregation analysis has been conducted on a single crystal sample fabricated by a directional solidification process with a single crystal seed. Results show that Co, Cr, and Fe partition toward the dendritic region, while Ni and Ti partition toward the interdendritic areas. Scheil analysis indicates that the solid-liquid partitioning ratio of each element is very similar to those in typical single crystal superalloys.

TI Fatigue crack growth mechanisms in superalloys: overview
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Fatigue studies on disc and blade nickel based superalloys by the author and co-workers are reviewed. Crack initiation in single crystal turbine blade alloys is dominated by interdendritic porosity with oxidation processes affecting initiation position. Lifetime trends can be modelled using a multipart Paris type lifing approach. Orientation, loading state, temperature and environment determine stage I/II crack growth mechanisms and the resulting crack path and should be considered in lifing. Mechanistic insights on how complex stress states, subsurface failures and different temperatures/environments affect fatigue processes can thus improve turbine blade lifing, and direct alloy development programmes. In polycrystalline disc alloys cracks at high temperature may initiate at oxidised subsurface carbides or porosity. Grain size controls cycle and time dependent crack growth: the benefits of increased grain size in resisting grain boundary attack mechanisms predominate over those of gamma' distribution variation. Optimising grain boundary character and distribution should yield the best alloy design strategy for high temperature fatigue performance in turbine discs.

AB Cobalt base superalloys are used extensively in applications requiring good wear, corrosion and heat resistance. The main goal of this study is to examine the effect of machining conditions (cutting speed, feed rate and depth of cut) on tool wear, chip morphology and cutting forces in symmetric face milling of cobalt base superalloy with physical vapour deposition coated and uncoated inserts. with the aim of achieving to achieve this goal, 90 milling experiments were carried out with different cutting speeds, feed rate and depth of cut under dry cutting conditions. The settings of machining parameters were determined by using general full factorial design method. Chip morphology, cutting forces and tool wear were compared by using PVD coated and uncoated hard metal inserts which are obtained dependent on feed rate, cutting speed and cutting depth. The cutting forces increase as the feed rate and depth of the cut increases, but cutting speeds' effect on cutting forces has not been observed for symmetric face milling. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Doppler-broadening spectra of positron annihilation radiation for pure metals Ni, Co and Cr and Ni-Co-Cr alloys with three different chemical compositions were measured by 2-detector coincidence technique. And the effect of the 3d electrons on Ni-Co-Cr alloy formation was analyzed. The results show that the 3d electron signal for the metal Ni is relatively higher among the three pure metals. The increase of Ni atom proportion in Ni-Co-Cr alloys leads to an increase in the probability of positron annihilation with free electrons. The experimental ratio curves for three Ni-Co-Cr alloys are greatly similar to the corresponding theoretic ratio curves, which indicate that the bonding nature in Ni-Co-Cr alloys is mainly metallic. This can explain why the Ni-Co-Cr alloys have good metal ductility.

SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Here, we investigate a new type of kink structure that is found at gamma/gamma' interfaces in nickel-based single crystal superalloys. We studied these structures at the atomic and elemental level using aberration corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM). The core of the dislocation absorbs high-Z elements (i.e., Co and Re) that adopt hexagonal arrangements, and it extrudes elements (i.e., Ni and Al) that adopt face centered cubic (fcc) structures. High-Z elements (i.e., Ta and W) and Cr, which is a low-Z element, are stabilized in body centered cubic (bcc) arrangements; Cr tends to behave like Re. High-Z elements, which migrate and adopt a hexagonal structure, induce kink formation at gamma/gamma' interfaces. This process must be analyzed to fully understand the kinetics and dynamics of creep in nickel-based single crystal superalloys. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SO ENTROPY
AB Compositionally complex alloys, or high entropy alloys, are good candidates for applications at higher temperatures in gas turbines. After their introduction, the equiatomic Al17Co17Cr17Cu17Fe17Ni17 (at.%) served as a starting material and a long optimization road finally led to the recently optimized Al10Co25Cr8Fe15Ni36Ti6 (at.%) alloy, which shows promising mechanical properties. Investigations of the as-cast state and after different heat treatments focus on the evolution of the microstructure and provide an overview of some mechanical properties. The dendritic solidification provides two phases in the dendritic cores and two different ones in the interdendritic regions. Three of the four phases remain after heat treatments. Homogenization and subsequent annealing produce a -' based microstructure, similar to Ni-based superalloys. The phase is Co-Cr-Fe rich and the ' phase is Al-Ni-Ti rich. The understanding of the mechanical behavior of the investigated alloy is supported and enhanced by the study of the different phases and their nanohardness measurements. The observations are compared with mechanical and microstructural data from commercial Ni-based superalloys, Co-based alloys, and Co-Ni-based alloys at the desired application temperature of similar to 800 degrees C.

AB Twinning has been found to be a dominate mechanism in the precipitate strengthened Ni-based superalloys during service at intermediate temperatures. Here, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and atomistic simulations have been combined to show that the twin nucleation process can be facilitated by Co replacing a fraction of Al in the precipitates, due to the negative binding energy of Co-Co atoms. The study further reveals that the presence of Co promotes a new twinning pathway featured with nucleation of one complex stacking fault (CSF) on the middle plane in between two separated CSFs. IMPACT STATEMENTWe demonstrate that Co in the precipitates promotes a new twinning pathway featured with nucleation of one CSF on the middle plane between two separated CSFs.

SO PHILOSOPHICAL MAGAZINE
AB The purpose of the present study is to introduce the weld quantitative solidification paths in the newly designed third-generation superalloys. The research has been conducted using both computational and experimental approaches. The model used the Scheil solidification relations to correlate the partitioning elements with their effects on the solidification paths. Accordingly, the k values were calculated for all the participating elements in the superalloy welds. The results of model demonstrated that these were very close to unity for austenite former elements, i.e. Ni, Co, Cr and Fe, while the other elements such as Ti, Nb and Mo displayed a significant tendency for segregation. The mathematical equations were calculated for weld solidification paths of superalloys. In all the welds, a remarkable segregation behaviour was observed, especially for Nb and Ti. The solidification path equations predicted type and amount of secondary phases. The solidification paths were compared with eutectic reactions on the basis of the Ni-Ti-C and Ni-Nb-C ternary phase diagrams. Both the experimental measurements and microstructural observations of eutectics exhibited an appropriate accordance with the solidification paths obtained by model calculations.

It is found that the measured densities of molten pure Ni and Ni-Cr, Ni-Co, Ni-W alloys decrease with increasing temperature in the experimental temperature range. The density of alloys increases with increasing W and Co concentrations while it decreases with increasing Cr concentration in the alloy at 1 773-1 873 K. The molar volume of Ni-based alloys increases with increasing W concentration while it decreases with increasing Co concentration. The effect of Cr concentration on the molar volume of the alloy is little in the studied concentration range. The accommodation among atomic species was analyzed. The deviation of molar volume from ideal mixing shows an ideal mixing of Ni-(Cr, Co, W) binary alloys.

AB Laser engineered net shaping(LENS) process was investigated using Co-based superalloy powder with a high power continuous wave CO2 laser. Thin wall part with smooth surface was obtained by LENS of layer-by-layer deposition of the powder materials. This thin wall sample was tested for metallographic examinations, micro-hardness, X-ray diffraction and mechanical property test. Microstructural results show that the layers possess rapid solidification microstructural feature, fine dendritic crystal and M7C3-type carbides (essentially chromium-rich carbide) dispersed in the gamma(Co,Cr) phase matrix. Dendrite spacing as well as the solidification mode can be controlled through control process parameters. In addition, this microstructural feature of the as-formed Co-base sample leads to an evident hardening and a superior tensile strength and toughness.

TI Oxidation of a chromia-forming nickel base alloy at high temperature in
   mixed diluted CO/H2O atmospheres
SO CORROSION SCIENCE
AB Corrosion of a chromia-forming nickel base alloy, Haynes 230 (R), has been investigated under impure helium containing a few Pa of CO and H2O at 900 degrees C. It has been found that this alloy reacts simultaneously with CO and H2O. Oxidation by CO has been revealed to occur mainly in the first hours. CO diffuses through the scale via short-circuit pathways and oxidizes Al, Cr and Si at the oxide/metal interface. Kinetics of CO oxidation has been investigated and several rate limiting steps are proposed. In the long term, H2O is the major oxidant of chromia-forming nickel base alloys in impure helium.

TI Friction and Wear Characteristics of Haynes 25, 188, and 214 Superalloys
   Against Hastelloy X up to 540 A degrees C
SO TRIBOLOGY LETTERS
AB As demand for more power increases, compression ratios, and operating temperatures keep rising. High speeds combined with high temperatures make turbomachinery sealing applications even more challenging. In order to confirm sufficient service life material pairs should be tested under conditions similar to engine operating conditions. This study presents high temperature friction and wear characteristics of cobalt/nickel superalloys, Haynes 25 (51Co-10Ni-20Cr-15W), Haynes 188 (39Co-22Ni-22Cr-14W), and Haynes 214 (75Ni-16Cr-3Fe-0.5Mn) sheets when rubbed against Hastelloy X (47Ni-22Cr-18Fe-9Mo) pins. Tests are conducted at 25, 200, 400, and 540 A degrees C with a validated custom design linear reciprocating tribometer. Sliding speed and sliding distance are 1 Hz and 1.2 km, respectively. Friction coefficients are calculated with friction force data acquired from a load cell. Wear coefficients are calculated through weight loss measurements. Results indicate that Haynes 25 (H25) has the lowest friction coefficients at all test temperatures. Above 400 A degrees C, H25 and Haynes 188 (H188) exhibit the best wear resistance. Protective cobalt oxide layers are formed on the H25 and H188 at 540 A degrees C in addition to nickel, chrome, and tungsten oxides. Although, it has better oxidation resistance, Haynes 214 has relatively higher wear rates than other tested materials especially at low temperatures. However, its wear performance improves beyond 200 A degrees C.

TI On the Development Concept for a New 718-Type Superalloy with Improved
   Temperature Capability
SO METALS
AB The superalloy 718 stands out for its excellent manufacturability and strength at ambient temperature. However, its application temperature is limited to about 650 degrees C due to the instability of the gamma '' precipitates. Here, we provide an in-depth account of an alloy development concept, allowing for the design of superalloys with 718-type properties, yet with a significantly improved microstructural stability. The article begins with a detailed discussion on how the microstructural and chemical composition must be altered to achieve this objective. Then, model alloys were used to explore and validate the outlined strategy. Finally, it is shown how these considerations ultimately led to a new 718-type superalloy with far more improved microstructural stability-namely, VDM Alloy 780. The introduction of a large amount of Co as a substitute for Fe (and partially Ni) is the most important element of our alloy development concept in terms of chemical composition. The most important microstructural feature is the introduction of low solvus temperature, high misfit gamma'-strengthening, replacing gamma ''-hardening.

AB A Co-Ti-W thin film materials library was fabricated by magnetron sputtering. By using automated high-throughput measurement techniques (resistance mapping, automated XRD measurements) and cluster analysis a yet unknown phase region was revealed. The existence region of the new ternary phase is close to the composition Co60Ti15W25. In order to transfer the results from thin film to bulk material, a bulk sample was prepared by arc melting and subsequent heat treatment. Scanning electron microscopy and chemical micro-analysis data support that a yet unknown ternary phase exists in the system Co-Ti-W.

TI Effect of initial gamma/gamma ' microstructure on creep of single
   crystal nickel-based superalloys: A phase-field simulation incorporating
   dislocation dynamics
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB The initial gamma/gamma' microstructure (e.g. gamma' shape, size, volume fraction) may dramatically affect creep behaviour of single crystal Nickel-based superalloys. However, it is difficult to have accurate control on each of these initial aspects and to understand the role of each by experimental methods. In the present work, a novel coupled model of phase-field and continuum dislocation dynamics is developed for the co-evolution of gamma/gamma' and dislocation microstructures, such that the creep deformation of single crystal Nickel-based superalloys can be described in a physical way. The creep curve can be directly obtained by averaging dislocation activity, without any phenomenological effort that is needed for traditional constitutive models. With the coupled model, we study the effect of initial gamma/gamma' microstructure on creep of single crystal Nickel-based superalloys. The role of initial gamma' shape is studied by comparing simulations with different initial gamma' shapes but with the same gamma' size and volume fraction. The role of initial gamma' size and volume fraction are studied in the same methodology. Simulation results show that as the gamma/gamma' misfit magnitude increases, the gamma' shape transits from circular to cubic and the dislocation microstructure symmetry shifts. The cubic gamma' shape corresponding to gamma/gamma' misfit of -0.003 is the most beneficial for creep resistance, compare with gamma/gamma' misfit of -0.0015 and 0. Bigger gamma' size and higher gamma' volume fraction also result in better creep resistance, especially the benefit of high gamma' volume fraction to creep resistance is dramatic. The simulation results may bring inspirations for design of new single crystal Nickel-based superalloys with excellent creep resistance. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Effect of High Magnetic Field on the Microstructure in Directionally
   Solidified Co-Al-W Alloy
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB Recently, a new Co-Al-W-based alloy with ordered L12 structure has been attracted much attention of researchers, these alloys have higher melting point than Ni-base superalloys with morphologically identical microstructure, but grain defect formation caused by thermosolutal convection has become an important problem for its application. Magnetic field is always applied to damp the convection which reduces the formation of defects. However, there are hitherto few papers to investigate the effect of magnetic field on grain defects during Co-Al-W- based alloy directional solidification. In this work, The effect of high magnetic field on the solidification structure and macrosegregation in directionally solidified Co-Al-Wbased alloy was investigated. The results showed that the application of longitudinal magnetic field can induce convection and cause deformation of the solid-liquid interface shape, forming the macrosegregation and the stray grains in the mushy zone at the pulling rate of 5 mu m/s. With the increase of pulling rate, the macrosegregation and the stray grains disappeared gradually at 2 T magnetic field. While the transverse magnetic field was applied, the macrosegregation became serious and the number of the stray grains increased. The macrosegregation further became more serious and the columnar-to-equiaxed transition was induced after adding the Ta element. The main reason of undercooling nucleation and columnar-toequiaxed transition (CET) was the microsegregation induced by thermoelectric magnetic convention.

SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Diffusion couples for fcc Co-Cr-Ni ternary system are prepared, all of which are annealed at 1573 K for 50 h. Interdiffusion coefficients are evaluated at the intersection points of two independent diffusion paths sharing a common composition. Such main and cross interdiffusion coefficients are then used to inversely retrieve atomic mobilities of Co, Cr and Ni in fcc Co-Cr-Ni alloys, with the aid of available thermodynamic description. Further validation concerning the quality of atomic mobilities is conducted with computational simulations for diffusion couples annealed at 1573 K for 50 h, the results of which are compared with experimental data.

AB The stabilities of the gamma-(Co), gamma'-Co-3(Al,W), mu-Co7W6, beta-CoAl and alpha-(W) phases in the Co-Al-W and Ni-Al-W ternary systems were investigated at 900, 1000, 1100 and 1300 degrees C. Electron probe microanalysis was used to determine compositions of the phases. Scanning electron microscopy was used to determine area fractions of the phases present after heat treatments. Thermodynamic modeling of the Co-Al-Ni-W quaternary system, using Pandat (TM) software, was incorporated to determine relevant thermodynamic parameters for phases in the Co-rich region of the system. Phases were modeled using the substitutional solution model and compound energy formalism. Excellent agreement was found between experiments and thermodynamic modeling. This new thermodynamic database enables predictions of stable gamma-gamma' compositions for a new class of high temperature, high strength Co-base superalloys.

TI Investigation of delamination mechanisms during a laser drilling on a
   cobalt-base superalloy
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY
AB Temperatures in the high pressure chamber of aircraft engines are continuously increasing to improve the engine efficiency. As a result, constitutive materials such as cobalt and nickel-base superalloys need to be thermally protected. The first protection is a ceramic thermal barrier coating (TBC) cast on all the hot gas-exposed structure. The second protection is provided by a cool air layer realized by the use of a thousand of drills on the parts where a cool air is flowing through. The laser drilling process is used to realize these holes at acute angles. It has been shown on coated single crystal nickel-base superalloy that the laser drilling process causes an interfacial cracking (also called delamination), detected by a cross section observation. The present work aims at characterizing interfacial cracking induced by laser drilling on coated cobalt-base super alloy. On the one hand, this work attempted to quantify the crack by several microscopic observations with regards to the most significant process parameters related as the angle beam. On the other hand, we studied the difference of the laser/ceramic and the laser/substrate interaction with real time observation by using a fast movie camera. (c) 2013 The Authors.

TI Atomistic modeling of pure Co and Co-Al system
SO CALPHAD-COMPUTER COUPLING OF PHASE DIAGRAMS AND THERMOCHEMISTRY
AB Interatomic potentials for pure Co and the Co-Al binary system have been developed based on the second nearest-neighbor modified embedded-atom method (2NN MEAM) potential formalism. The potentials can describe various fundamental physical properties of the relevant materials in good agreement with experimental information. The potential is utilized to an atomistic computation of interfacial properties between fcc-Co (gamma) and Co3Al (gamma') phases. It is found that the anisotropy in the gamma/gamma' interfacial energy is relatively small and leaves a room for further modification by alloying other elements. The applicability of the atomistic approach to an elaborate alloy design of advanced Co-based superalloys through the investigation of the effect of alloying elements on interfacial and elastic properties is discussed.

TI Improvement and micro-mechanism of a low expansion superalloy
SO RARE METALS
AB Chromium free low expansion superalloys Incoloy 900 series based on the system Fe-Ni-Co-Nb-Ti are precipitation-strengthen austenitic alloys with combination of very low thermal expansion coefficient and high tensile strength. The most important problem of these alloys is the susceptibility to stress accelerated grain boundary oxygen embrittlement (SAGBO) due to the absence of chromium. The oxidation resistance of the alloys after they were exposed for long time at high temperatures and the notch bar rupture strength have been improved with appropriate rare earth (RE) addition. With trace yttrium addition, the platelet precipitates become smaller and denser and the phase of precipitate transforms from epsilon phase to H phase. The crystal structures of the platelet phases in the conventional and Y-containing superalloys have been investigated and determined. The interface between the H phase and the matrix hits also been demonstrated.

TI On the surface preparation of nickel superalloys before CoNiCrAlY

SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB This work is dedicated to the study and the characterization of the surface of nickel superalloys before the deposition of the MCrAlY (M = Co, Ni or both) bond coat. Our aim is to determine the factors (roughness, contamination and others) that lead to the best properties of the coating in terms of adhesion. We used MAR M247 samples as substrates. Different preparation treatments were considered: dry and wet blasting by corundum with different grain size distribution, dry blasting by silicon carbide and cleaning by solid carbon dioxide. In general, we observed that the highest roughness led to the best adhesion as measured by critical load tests. However, this parameter must be balanced against known problems related to the use of coarse abrasive powders. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SO JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS
AB The present paper describes the corrosion behavior of recently developed Ni-base superalloys: an oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) alloy, two kinds of Ni-Cr-W alloys and Hastelloy XR at 1373 K in a simulated HTGR impure helium gas. Corrosion tests were carried out using a transparent quartz retort at 1373 K for up to 3.6 Ms in circulating helium gas which contained a small amount of H-2, CH4, CO, CO2 and H2O. The mass change versus exposure time relation revealed that the ODS alloy exhibited excellent oxidation resistance. One Ni-Cr-W alloy (113MA) and Hastelloy XR showed exfoliation of the oxide films after the tests. All the alloys were decarburized from the early exposure times. These results are discussed on the basis of phase stability diagrams for constituent elements in the alloys.

TI Isothermal Oxidation Behavior of Single-Crystal Nickel-Base Superalloy
   DD10
SO RARE METAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING
AB The isothermal oxidation behaviors of two kinds of single-crystal nickel-base superalloys DD10 with different cobalt contents were investigated at 900, 1000 and 1100 degrees C in air by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy disperse X-ray analysis (EDX). It is found that increasing the cobalt content can decrease the diffusion activity energy of the alloy and thus increase the oxidation rate slightly. For the oxidation at 900 degrees C and 1000 degrees C, the mass gain basically obeys the parabola law. The oxide scales consist of three layers: an outer layer of Cr2O3 and TiO2, a thin intermediate layer of CrTaO4 and Ta2O5, and a continuous inner layer of Al2O3. For the oxidation at 1100 degrees C, because of the severe spalling of the scale and the volatilization of the CrO3, the kinetics curves deviate from the parabolic law a little. Some spinels such as NiCr2O4, CoAl2O4, CoNiO2 and Co2TiO4 form and inner nitridation phenomenon happens.

TI Phase transformations and gamma ' phase stability in model CoAlW
   superalloys
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB The present work aims at understanding the transformation mechanisms of gamma'-L1(2) precipitates in the ternary Co-Al-W system from quenched state to thermodynamic equilibrium. Three alloys with compositions Co-9Al-7W, Co-10Al-12W and Co-7Al-9W (at.%) were aged at 900 degrees C for 10 h, 200 h and 1000 h. The microstructure has been characterized by transmission and scanning electron microscopies, and the phase composition was determined using atom probe tomography. Results show that irrespective of the initial supersaturation, the quenched state is already decomposed into gamma+gamma'. This indicates that even in the Co-7Al-9W alloy that lies in the gamma+Co3W domain of the phase diagram, gamma' phase forms at first, indicating that gamma' is a metastable phase. In the two other alloys, during ageing at 900 degrees C gamma' phase dissolves and the equilibrium state is composed of gamma, CoAl and Co-3 W phases. The gamma' phase in the Co-7Al-9W alloy dissolves more rapidly compared to the two other alloys that are in the gamma+gamma' metastable domain. The volume fraction of Co3W phase increases rapidly with ageing time in the Co-7Al-9W alloy. Whereas gamma' phase is predominant at short ageing times, it becomes a minor phase after 1000 h of ageing, and is replaced mostly by the Co3W phase. As already observed, the transformation from gamma'-L1(2) to Co3W-D0(19) phase is taking place through a stacking fault. This mechanism occurs in the three alloys. In addition, a new dissolution mechanism interpreted as destabilization of the gamma' phase is evidenced in the Co-9Al-7W. The gamma' precipitates tend to split along {111} planes. Transmission electron microscopy investigations show that the dissolution and splitting mechanism of the gamma' phase is initiated by stacking faults, that are subsequently wetted by the gamma phase.

TI CORROSION OF NICKEL, IRON, COBALT AND THEIR ALLOYS IN MOLTEN-SALT
   ELECTROLYTES
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB The processes of high-temperature corrosion, anodic dissolution and passivation of nickel, iron, cobalt and their alloys are reviewed to reveal the progress in understanding the reaction mechanisms defined in the last two decades. In the first part, the procedures of thermodynamical analysis of corrosion processes by potential - pO(2-) diagrams are outlined. The second part is devoted to the electrochemical corrosion, anodic dissolution and passivation of the metals studied, the reaction mechanisms and composition of the corrosion layers formed. The effect of the alloying elements on the corrosion resistance and anodic behaviour of the base metal is treated in the third part. A brief summary of the kinetics of the so-called ''hot corrosion'' of the studied metals and their alloys in contact with thin molten salt films and aggressive atmospheres is then given. Finally, some conclusions are drawn and some future trends of investigation are indicated.

TI Microstructural Changes during High Temperature Service of a
   Cobalt-Based Superalloy First Stage Nozzle
SO ADVANCES IN MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
AB Superalloys are a group of alloys based on nickel, iron, or cobalt, which are used to operate at high temperatures (T > 540 degrees C) and in situations involving very high stresses like in gas turbines, particularly in the manufacture of blades, nozzles, combustors, and discs. Besides keeping its high resistance to temperatures which may approach 85% of their melting temperature, these materials have excellent corrosion resistance and oxidation. However, after long service, these components undergo mechanical and microstructural degradation; the latter is considered a major cause for replacement of the main components of gas turbines. After certain operating time, these components are very expensive to replace, so the microstructural analysis is an important tool to determine the mode of microstructure degradation, residual lifetime estimation, and operating temperature and most important to determine the method of rehabilitation for extending its life. Microstructural analysis can avoid catastrophic failures and optimize the operating mode of the turbine. A case study is presented in this paper.

TI Prediction of creep rupture life in nickel-base superalloys using
   Bayesian neural network
SO JOURNAL OF THE JAPAN INSTITUTE OF METALS
AB The creep rupture life of nickel-base superalloys has been predicted using a neural network model within a Bayesian framework. The rupture life was modelled as a function of some 42 variables, including temperature, chemical composition: Cr, Co, C, Si, Mn, P, S, Mo, Cu, Ti, Al, B, N, Nb, Ta, Zr, Fe, W, V, Hf, Re, Mg, ThO2, La, four steps of heat treatment (each has its own temperature, duration and cooling rate), sample shape, solidification method, yield strength, ultimate tensile strength and elongation. The Bayesian method puts error bars on the predicted value of the rupture life and allows the significance of each individual factor to be estimated. The scale of the error bars changes with the accuracy of the prediction: it is large when the prediction is uncertain, indicating that the whole prediction system is reliable.

SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB The effects of Co and Ti additions on the microstructures and compressive strength of the Ni-based superalloy Udiemt710 (U710) were investigated. The preliminary results showed that the Ni(3)Ti-type (eta) phase was observed in the alloys with low Co and Ti content; while a (Ni(x)Co(1-x))(3)Ti phase with a hexagonal structure was detected in the alloys with high Co and Ti content. The gamma ' ->eta ->( Ni(x)Co(1-0))(3)Ti phase transformation was discussed in terms of Co and Ti contents. The gamma ' morphology changed from spherical to cuboidal with increasing Co and Ti content. Compressive tests showed that the alloys with Co and Ti addition possessed higher yield strength than the base alloy, U710. The strength increase could be ascribed to solid-solution strengthening of the gamma and gamma ' phases as a result of the Co and Ti additions, and the higher volume fraction of gamma ' in the new alloys.

TI Flow behaviors and microstructural evolutions of a novel high-Co powder
   metallurgy superalloy during hot working
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY
AB To understand how to tailor microstructure of high-Co polycrystalline superalloys during hot processing, the flow curves of a nickel-based superalloy with high Co content was quantitatively analyzed, and the microstructure evolution was studied by a high-throughput method. The results suggested that hot working conditions, especially the temperature, strongly influenced the grain structure at annealing. In specific, deforming under low strain rate and high temperature conditions facilitated the recovery and grain growth to consume the stored strain energy, furthermore, the weakened pinning effects of gamma' precipitates accelerated these procedures, which made the high-Co superalloy more vulnerable to the formation of abnormally large grains during subsequent supersolvus annealing.

AB Low-Pt/Hf co-doped beta-NiAlCrSi and Hf single-doped beta-NiAlCrSi coatings were produced onto advanced single crystal (SC) superalloy IC21 containing Mo, respectively. The cyclic oxidation and interdiffusion behaviour of the coatings at 1200 degrees C were investigated. As compared to the single-doped coating, the co-doped coating revealed suppressed interdiffusion and delayed beta-gamma' phase transformation. Simultaneously, the interfacial voids formation and scale rumpling were inhibited. As a result, the thermally grown oxide (TGO) grown on the co-doped coating exhibited improved adherence and the roles of Pt and Hf in low-Pt/Hf co-doped coating were discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The phases formed at the interface between an intermetallic (NiAl) and a nickel base superalloy joined by combustion synthesis were investigated, particularly the eutectic phases. Owing to their small size, the characterisation of these phases using a Castaing's electron microprobe encounters difficulties. The analysis volume size is generally too large to differentiate the phases from their surrounding matrix, even by using low accelerating voltage. Moreover, the eutectic phases contain boron, which is difficult to characterise by EPMA. Independently of the phases shape, the characterisation can be solved by viewing this complex system as a surrounding matrix and a multi layer system. The results of these simulations revealed the presence of two categories of borides: the eutectic boride MM'B-2(2) (M = Mo and M' = Co, Cr) and the solid solution boride [Cr1-x (Mo, W)(x)]B.

TI Effect of superficially applied ZrO2 inhibitor on the high temperature
   corrosion performance of some Fe-, Co- and Ni-base superalloys
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB High temperature corrosion is an acute form of corrosion occurring at elevated temperature in the presence of an oxidizing gas and is associated with a thin electrolytic deposit (salt or ash) on alloy. Inhibitors and fuel additives have been used with varying success to combat oil ash corrosion. In this paper, the effect of an oxide additive namely ZrO2 on the hot corrosion behaviour of some superalloys, viz. Superfer 800H (alloy A), Superco 605 (alloy B) and Superni 75 (alloy C) has been investigated in an Na2SO4-60% V2O5 environment at 900 degrees C for 50 cycles. Each cycle consisted of 1 h heating in a Silicon Carbide Tube furnace followed by 20 min cooling in ambient air. Weight change measurements after each cycle were taken by an electronic balance having an accuracy of 0.01 mg. XRD, SEM and EPMA analyses of the exposed specimens were carried out to characterize the oxide scales. In the Na2SO4-60% V2O5 environment, the corrosion rate for the Co-base alloy was found to be highest, whereas that for the Ni-base Superni 75 a lowest. Whereas, with ZrO2 superficial coating, the overall weight gains got reduced for the alloys B and C, however the inhibitor was marginally effective in the alloy A. A thick scale was observed in the latter case, which was rich in Cr, Ni, Fe and V. Absence of protective continuous chromia layer and presence of less protective NiO was probably the main reason for more corrosion rate in this case. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

TI Effect of Ti and Al on microstructure and partitioning behavior of

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MINERALS METALLURGY AND MATERIALS
AB The microstructure and partitioning behaviors of alloying elements in the gamma and gamma' phases in Ni-based powder metallurgy superalloys with different Ti and Al contents were investigated. The results showed that Ti and Al were mainly enriched in the gamma' phase, partially partitioned in the gamma matrix, and slightly distributed in the carbides. Different Ti and Al contents in various alloys influenced the composition and amount of MC carbides but did not influence the MC carbides' morphology. With increasing Ti and Al contents, gamma + gamma' fan-type structures formed at the grain boundary, eventually resulting in a coarsened gamma' phase. In addition, the morphology of the secondary gamma' phase transformed from nearly spherical to cuboidal. The saturation degrees of Cr, Co, and Mo in the gamma matrix were substantially improved with increasing Ti and Al contents.

TI Properties of newly developed Co-based brazing fillers
SO WELDING IN THE WORLD
AB Co-based materials are widely used in high temperature applications like aircraft industry, industrial furnaces, or gas turbine manufacturing. The main requirements on the Co superalloys are high temperature and corrosion resistance. To produce complex structures, it is necessary to join these alloys. In this work, Co-based brazing fillers for high temperature service conditions are developed. The influence of different alloying elements on the melting behavior as well as on the microstructure is investigated. A melting temperature below 1200 degrees C is achieved via addition of Ti to the near eutectic alloy CoZrTaC9, developed in previous studies. Brazing tests are carried out on the Co-based superalloy Mar M 509 using induction heating. The mechanical properties are determined by tensile tests at room temperature and at an elevated temperature of 850 degrees C. The fracture morphology of the tensile samples is investigated by light microscopy as well as SEM.

TI Activation Energy of Oxidation of Novel Co-Al-W Superalloys at High
   Temperatures
SO RARE METAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING
AB Co-Al-W alloy is a novel Co-base superalloy, with the precipitation strengthening phase of ternary compound gamma'-Co(3)(Al,W). The kinetic data of oxidation mass gain were measured for the Co-Al-W alloy at 800 and 900 degrees C in air, and the oxidation rate constants at different temperatures were determined by the relevant linear fitting. According to Arrhenius relation of the oxidation rate constants, the activation energy of oxidation was derived for this alloy at 800 and 900 degrees C. It is found that 9W alloy has the highest value of activation energy of oxidation among 7.5W, 9W and 10.7W at different temperatures. The addition of refractory elements Mo, Nb, Ta and Ti can change the mass gain and activation energy of oxidation of the Co-Al-W alloy; therefore, the oxidation resistance of the superalloy at high temperatures can be forecast.

TI Microsegregation behavior of alloying elements in single-crystal
   nickel-based superalloys with emphasis on dendritic structure
SO MATERIALS CHARACTERIZATION
AB Directionally solidified single crystal of CMSX-4 superalloy was investigated to show the evolution of microsegregation and the effect of crystal orientations on the solute distribution. As the solidification proceeded, Al, Ti, Ta and Mo consistently segregated to the residual liquid, while Co, W and Re segregated to the solidified y dendrite core. Cr did not exhibit a consistent segregation tendency to either side. Increasing the solid volume fraction resulted in increasing segregation levels of Al, Ti, Ta, Co, W and Re, whereas the segregation levels of Cr and Mo did not consistently change. For most of the alloying elements, the solute profiles of the same element were similar along the [100] and the [110] crystal orientations. For Al, Ti and Ta, the solute contents increased from the dendrite core towards its periphery. Re, W, and Co showed the opposite trend. For Mo and Cr, uniform distribution profiles were shown along the [100] orientation with increasing distance from the gamma dendrite core towards its periphery, while a large variation in the solute contents of both elements was observed along the [110] orientation. The solutes across a typical dendrite distributed more homogeneously along the [100] orientation than those along the [110] orientation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A so called multiphase separation method (MPSM) is proposed to quantitatively separate precipitated phases from their surrounding matrix phase in chemistry for bulk alloy/steel samples under EPMA/SEM-EDS measurement conditions. Applied examples to comparisons of the results through the MPSM with the values either cited or obtained via other analytical means relevant are indicative of the feasibility, accuracy as well as applicability of the MPSM, which deal with chemistry, amount, lattice parameter, elemental partitioning, atomic-site occupancy and stability of precipitated phases of either superalloy or heat-resistant steel samples analyzed. Successful applications of the MPSM not only show a significant improvement for difficulties in accurate quantification in phase chemistry under the EPMA/SEM-EDS measurement conditions but also provide with a useful and helpful tool to determine some other important physical quantities in alloys and steels, which make it possible to quantitatively and more widely evaluate structure-property relationships of the materials investigated through analyzing their bulk samples under EPMA/SEM-EDS measurement conditions.

AB Recently, operating temperature of USC plants is getting higher and planned up to 700 degrees C. Austenitic superalloys are promising instead of ferritic heat resistant steels because of necessity of high strength at around 650-700 degrees C. In general, austenitic Ni base superalloys indicate higher creep rupture strength than ferritic heat resistant steels, however their thermal expansions are higher, creep rupture ductilities lower, and costs higher. Firstly, to obtain low thermal expansion we have noticed Mo containing superalloy, then investigated the effect of Mo and Co content, the amount of gamma prime phase, Al/Ti ratio in gamma prime phase on thermal expansion, tensile properties, and creep rupture properties, compared with conventional Mo containing alloy252 as a reference. As a result, a developed superalloy, although it contains no Co, combined with modified heat treatment, indicated much higher creep rupture elongation than Alloy252, keeping low thermal expansion and high creep rupture strength close to Alloy252.
   Furthermore, Creep-rupture properties at 700 degrees C up to about 20,000h were evaluated for long-term applications, and weldability and mechanical properties of weld joint at 750 degrees C were also investigated for boiler tube applications.

AB The oxidation behavior of Ni-based superalloys was examined by cyclic oxidation tests at 850 and 1000 degrees C. The present study focused on the investigation of two newly developed and three commercial alloys (GTD-111, IN738LC, and CM247LC). The oxidation resistance of the superalloys were evaluated by the oxidation rate constants and the mass gains. The oxidation scales mainly consisted of outer Cr2O3 and inner Al2O3 layers at both temperatures, as well as oxides of minor elements such as TiO2, NiCr2O4, CrTaO4, HfO2, and TaO. The oxidation resistance of the alloys containing larger amounts of Al, W, and Ta and lower Mo and Ti concentrations was higher than those of the other alloys. The ranking of oxidation resistance for the alloys corresponded to the statistical prediction drawn from a response surface analysis. Furthermore, these alloys contained more Ta oxides, such as CrTaO4 and TaO, suggesting that Ta oxides had an active role in improving the oxidation resistance.

AB The newly developed TMW (R) disk superalloy exhibits better overall mechanical properties in the intended service temperature region (650-750 degrees C) than the most advanced cast & wrought disk alloy U720Li. Clarification of the underlying mechanisms is beneficial for designing advanced superalloys. Among the TMW alloys, TMW-4M3 has the best tensile strength and creep resistance. In this study, tensile tests of U720Li and TMW-4M3 were conducted at temperatures ranging from 25 degrees C to 750 degrees C. The deformation microstructures have been investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Dislocation activity, involving anti-phase boundary (APB), was the dominant mechanism in U720Li up to 725 degrees C. However, the transition of deformation mechanisms from dislocation pairs cutting to stacking fault (SF) shearing and deformation twinning was observed in TMW-4M3. A concise model related to the increased surface energy is put forward to describe the competing mechanisms. It is found that APB energy, SF energy (SFE), and volume fraction of tertiary gamma' have important influence on the transition of deformation mechanisms. The controlling of deformation mechanism by alloy design is discussed.

AB The atomic structure of some Ni-base single-crystal superalloys has been investigated using atom-probe field ion microscopy (APFIM) and the results compared with numerical estimations obtained from the alloy design program (ADP) and the cluster variation method (CVM). Re-containing CMSX4 and V-containing RR2000 alloys, together with TMS63 are the subjects of this study. It is found that Ti, Ta and Hf have a strong preference for the gamma' phase, whereas Cr, Co, W, Re and Mo tend to dissolve in the gamma phase. V has a very weak preference for the gamma phase. The results agree very well with both ADP and CVM. The APFIM analyses have also revealed that Re atoms in CMSX4 tend to preferentially occupy the sites normally designated for Al atoms in the gamma' phase. It is demonstrated that the site occupancy of other alloying elements such as Ta, W, Mo and Co can be estimated accurately using CVM, although there are some discrepancies for the distributions of Cr, Ti and Ni. The effect of solute atom distribution on creep properties is discussed briefly.

TI Formation of primary M6C carbide and its effect on cast die superalloys
   with high content of tungsten
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB Nickel based superalloys with high content of tungsten (W) have been applied to cast the large size die. Because the formation of large amount of primary M6C phase embrittles the die, it is necessary to explore the forming condition of primary M6C. The experiments prove that the alloys containing carbon content higher than 0.15% (mass fraction) tend to precipitate primary M6C carbide and 10% Co can restrict the formation of M6C effectively. The primary M6C forms at 1375 V. The cooling rate between the solid and liquid temperature range can influence the precipitation of this phase sensitively. Rapid cooling retard the formation of M6C obviously. The section size effect of the formation of M6C exists in castings. For a heavy section possessing dendrite spacing higher than 150 mum, it is very easy to form M6C with a millimeter magnitude, which damages the high temperature strength of alloys. To prevent the precipitation of M6C in large size section die, the composition of alloy is recommended to maintain at the level of 0.04%-0.07% C and 10%-15% Co.

TI Rafting of gamma' precipitates in a Co-9Al-9W superalloy during

SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB The rafting of gamma' precipitates was investigated in a single crystal of Co-9Al-9W(at%) superalloy after compression creep tests at 850 degrees C. Scanning electron micrographs show that the gamma' precipitates raft perpendicular to the compressive stress axis, due to their positive lattice parameter misfit. The rafting of gamma' precipitates occurred after the minimum strain rate was reached. The dislocation structure and stacking faults were investigated by transmission electron microscopy. Dislocations preferentially moved in the horizontal gamma matrix channels where they can relieve the coherency stress at horizontal gamma/gamma' interfaces. After extended periods of creep, rafting of the gamma' precipitates perpendicular to the external compressive stress axis occurred. The merging of gamma' precipitates during rafting initiated at the precipitates corners, leaving pockets of matrix phase in the vertical gamma channels between adjacent gamma' precipitates. The necessary diffusion of alloying elements during the rafting process between the two orientations of matrix channels should be decelerated as diffusion is slower in the ordered L1(2) gamma' phase than in the disordered gamma phase.

TI Stability of TaC precipitates in a Co-Re-based alloy being developed for
   ultra-high-temperature applications
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED CRYSTALLOGRAPHY
AB Co-Re alloys are being developed for ultra-high-temperature applications to supplement Ni-based superalloys in future gas turbines. The main goal of the alloy development is to increase the maximum service temperature of the alloy beyond 1473 K, i.e. at least 100 K more than the present single-crystal Ni-based superalloy turbine blades. Co-Re alloys are strengthened by carbide phases, particularly the monocarbide of Ta. The binary TaC phase is stable at very high temperatures, much greater than the melting temperature of superalloys and Co-Re alloys. However, its stability within the Co-Re-Cr system has never been studied systematically. In this study an alloy with the composition Co-17Re-23Cr-1.2Ta-2.6C was investigated using complementary methods of small-angle neutron scattering (SANS), scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and neutron diffraction. Samples heat treated externally and samples heated in situ during diffraction experiments exhibited stable TaC precipitates at temperatures up to 1573 K. The size and volume fraction of fine TaC precipitates (up to 100 nm) were characterized at high temperatures with in situ SANS measurements. Moreover, SANS was used to monitor precipitate formation during cooling from high temperatures. When the alloy is heated the matrix undergoes an allotropic phase transformation from the "phase (hexagonal close-packed) to the gamma phase (face-centred cubic), and the influence on the strengthening TaC precipitates was also studied with in situ SANS. The results show that the TaC phase is stable and at these high temperatures the precipitates coarsen but still remain. This makes the TaC precipitates attractive and the Co-Re alloys a promising candidate for high-temperature application.

Particular attention is paid to the morphology, particle size distribution, and surface composition of the as atomised powders and their effect on subsequent consolidation. The consolidated powders are fully characterised in terms of microstructure and the composition and distribution of secondary phases. The effect of hipping temperature on the microstructure, hardness, and tensile properties of the powders are discussed in terms of the optimum processing temperature for the various alloys.

SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB NiAlCr-X overlay coatings deposited by magnetron sputtering on IN100 and CMSX-4 superalloys and thereafter top-coated with 7YSZ thermal barrier coatings by EB-PVD were investigated with emphasis on the effects of superalloy type and Hf or Zr doping. The sputtered films in the "as coated" condition (after EB-PVD deposition) showed strong diffusion effects of different elements from the superalloys. The measured phase content of beta and gamma' was in good agreement with calculated data obtained from experimental compositions normalized to a Ni-Al-Cr system following the guidelines of site preference of ternary alloying elements. Microstructure evolution and failure characteristics after furnace cyclic tests at 1100 degrees C were investigated as well. The lifetime of the coatings is equivalent to standard MCrAlY TBCs systems and is compared to PtAl and NiCoCrAlY coatings from literature. The effects of microstructure and elements diffusing from the substrates into the bond coat (Ti, Co, Mo and Ta) in combination with the effect of Hf- or Zr-doping is presented and discussed.

AB The useful operating life of superalloy components operating in gas turbines is dependent to a large extent on the ability of applied surface coatings to resist corrosive degradation. Coatings have been fine-tuned over many years of use to give satisfactory performance in airborne applications, but the recent adoption of I:as turbines in the utility sector has placed renewed demand on the need to evaluate and develop existing and new coating systems. This paper describes the behaviour of a series of vacuum plasma sprayed MCrAlY(Si) and Al/Si coatings applied to the Ni-base IN738 and UD520 and Co-base FSX-414 and X45 superalloys. Test specimens have been exposed to both simple argon-O-2-SO2 gas mixtures and to simulated combustion gas mixtures in a low-velocity burner rig for times up to 1000 hours in the temperature range 800 to 1000 degrees C, The results obtained in the form of microstructural changes suggest an upper temperature limit below 900 degrees C for the application of high Al anti Si-containing coatings due to interdiffusion with the base alloy and a strong influence of combustion gas composition on corrosion rate.

Upon isothermal holdings at 1100, 1150, and 1200 degrees C, a "superstructure contraction" of the crystal lattice was observed. The degrees of long-range order at room temperature were determined for these alloys. Alloying with Nb, Ti, W, and V favors the retention of the high degree of long-range order in the alloy, whereas Cr, Co, and Fe added in Ni3Al decrease its value.

   superalloys
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB Single crystal nickel-base superalloys with spherical, intermediately shaped and cuboidal gamma' precipitates have been observed in Ru-containing superalloys with substantial amounts of Re and W. The gamma' precipitates experienced stress-induced directional coarsening (rafting) during creep deformation at 950 degrees C and 290 MPa indicative of a wide range of gamma-gamma' lattice misfit, which vary from negative to near-zero to positive. The precipitate morphology, lattice misfit and compositions of the gamma and the gamma' phases are interrelated, and therefore, the elemental partitioning between the phases were investigated to determine the origin of the unusual microstructural features. TEM-based EDS analysis of the gamma and gamma' phases indicate that the combination of Ru and Cr influences the partitioning of Re, which displays a wide range of partitioning behavior within the investigated alloy compositions. In alloys containing 5.7-9.6 wt.% Ru and no Cr, Re partitioned to both the gamma and gamma' phases. With high levels of Cr (6.7 wt.%) the Re strongly partitioned to the gamma matrix, while in alloys with intermediate Cr and Ru levels, the Re displayed intermediate partitioning behavior. The Ru and Co partitioned nearly equally between the gamma and the gamma' phase in all of the experimental Ru-containing alloys investigated. The degree of Cr partitioning was also similar among the alloys investigated, however, it partitioned more strongly to the gamma phase. These investigations demonstrate that Ru and Cr control the lattice misfit and precipitate shape, through the associated changes in system thermodynamics that alter the gamma and gamma' phase compositions.

TI A continuum approach to combined gamma/gamma ' evolution and dislocation
   plasticity in Nickel-based superalloys
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLASTICITY
AB In single crystal Nickel-based superalloys subject to creep loading, the gamma/gamma' phase microstructure co-evolves with the system of dislocations under load. Computational modeling thus requires multiphysics approaches capable of describing and simulating both phase and defect microstructures within a common conceptual framework. To do so, we formulate a coupled continuum model of the evolution of phase and dislocation microstructures. The simulated gamma/gamma' phase microstructure accounts for concentration as well as crystallographic order parameters. Dislocation microstructure evolution is described in terms of dislocation densities and associated stress-driven dislocation fluxes. The creep strain curve is obtained as a natural by-product of the microstructure evolution equations. We perform simulations of gamma/gamma' evolution for different dislocation densities and establish the driving forces for microstructure evolution by analyzing in detail the changes in different contributions to the elastic energy and chemical free energy density, as well as the evolution of stress concentrations that may trigger the transition from dislocation flow in the gamma channels towards shearing of the gamma' precipitates. Our investigation reveals the mechanisms controlling the process of directional coarsening (rafting) and demonstrates that the kinetics of rafting significantly depends on characteristics of the dislocation microstructure. In addition to rafting under constant load, we investigate the effect of changes in loading conditions and explore the possibility of improving creep properties by pre-rafting along a different loading path.

Significant differences between IN738LC and Mar-M509 were observed with respect to grain size, grain shape and texture sharpness. Alloy IN738LC exhibits coarse and elongated grains with a sharp texture and thus a pronounced mechanical anisotropy. Alloy Mar-M509 shows smaller grains with only moderate structural and mechanical anisotropy. The different micro structural and mechanical characteristics are attributed to the different recovery and recrystallization behavior of IN738LC and Mar-M509. The high stacking fault energy (SFE) of IN738LC results in pronounced recovery of lattice defects without affecting the basic grain structure, whereas the low SFE in Mar-M509 favors recrystallization with the effect of significant grain refinement and weakening of the solidification texture. The effect of microstructure and the structural anisotropy on the orientation-dependent values of the Young's modulus and the mechanical properties are further discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TI Microstructure and mechanical behavior at elevated temperatures of a
   novel nickel base superalloy heavily alloyed with forming and
   substitution elements
SO LETTERS ON MATERIALS
AB A novel nickel base superalloy heavily alloyed with gamma' forming and substitution elements, particularly with rhenium and tungsten, has been proposed in the present work as a potential die material for die forging of the most hard-to-deform nickel base superalloys. The superalloy composition is Ni-13(Al, Ti, Nb, Ta)-27(Cr, Co, Mo, W, Re, Si, C, B) (wt.%). The superalloy ingot was manufactured by vacuum induction melting. Microstructure examination showed that the as-cast condition was characterized by a coarse grained dendritic structure consisted of coarse gamma grains containing gamma' precipitates with a size 0.3 -1 mu m and primary gamma' particles with a size 5 -100 mu m. A small amount of carbides and topologically close packed (TCP) phases was also detected. The microstructure examination suggests that the general solidification pathway was L ->gamma ->gamma', as it is in nickel base superalloys. At the same time, the primary gamma' particles were probably formed via the peritectic reaction L-noneq + gamma ->gamma', where L-noneq is the nonequilibrium liquid, which was retained at the peritectic temperature. The superalloy was subjected to heat treatment including solid solution treatment and ageing. The heat treatment led to coagulation of the primary gamma' phase and to a slight decrease in the volume fractions of carbides and TCP phases. The heat treated condition was used to prepare samples for compression tests, which were performed at 900-1200 degrees C up to the true strain e= 0.1. The yield strength of the novel superalloy was generally appreciably higher as compared with those of known nickel base superalloys and alloys based on the Ni3Al intermetallic phase.

TI Micropillar compression deformation of single crystals of Co-3(Al,W)
   with the L1(2) structure
SO SCRIPTA MATERIALIA
AB The compression deformation behavior of single-crystal micropillars of L1(2)-Co-3(Al,W) has been investigated at room temperature as a function of pillar size and crystal orientation. The critical resolved shear stress (CRSS) obeys an inverse power-law scaling against pillar size and is independent of orientation. With the bulk CRSS value of Co-3(Al,W) at room temperature estimated by extrapolating the size dependence of CRSS for micropillars, comparison of high-temperature strength is made on the CRSS values for Co-3(Al,W) and Ni3Al-based compounds. Co-3(Al,W) has turned out not to be strong enough to provide excellent high-temperature strength for Co-based superalloys, at least for ternary composition. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

TI EFFECT OF LONG-TERM 1093-K EXPOSURE TO AIR OR VACUUM ON THE STRUCTURE OF

CY JUN 06-09, 1993

AB Long-term 1093 K heat treatments of three commercial superalloy sheet materials were undertaken in air and vacuum. With either exposure, significant precipitation of second phases occurred in the Co-base Haynes(R) Alloy 188 (HA 188) and the Ni-base Haynes(R) Alloy 230 (HA 230); however, much less precipitation was found in the exposed Ni-base alloy Inconel(R) 617 (IN 617). Although some grain growth occurred in HA 188, no changes in the grain size of either RA 230 or IN 617 were observed after 22,500 h at temperature. Oxidation during air heat treatments led to weight gain due to the formation of chromia + spinel scales and surface-connected grain boundary pits/oxides in all three superalloys. Both the weight gain and depth of intergranular attack were dependent on the square root of time, which is indicative of diffusion-controlled phenomena. Because many alloy samples had neighbors in close proximity, most vacuum heat treated specimens did not suffer significant loss of volatile elements. However, some exposed samples were subjected to unrestricted vacuum heat treatments, allowing estimates of volatilization to be made. Based on the data for HA 188, the weight loss during 1093 K vacuum exposure was diffusion controlled once the inhibiting effects of surface films on the as-received alloys were broken down.

TI Creep Degradation of Thermally Exposed IN738C Superalloy
SO JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING FOR GAS TURBINES AND POWER-TRANSACTIONS OF THE
   ASME
AB Creep degradation of an IN738C superalloy after long-term thermal exposure in an atmospheric furnace was investigated by means of accelerated creep tests. Experimental observation showed that the minimum creep rate increased by increasing the exposure time or exposure temperature and is a key factor for predicting creep life during long time, high temperature service. Concerning the exposure temperature and time, an empirical equation has been presented to estimate the creep lives of the pre-exposed specimens. Furthermore, the accuracy of the Monkman-Grant (Proceedings of ASTM, Vol. 56, pp. 593-620) relationship has been verified by experimental results.

TI Diffusion coefficients of transition metals in fcc cobalt
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB Using first-principles density functional theory (DFT), we calculate the diffusivities of 32 different solute elements all transition metals, together with Al and Si in fcc cobalt within the formalism of the five frequency model. For self-diffusion in fcc cobalt, we compare the accuracy of various approximations to the exchange-correlation energy functional of DFT in estimating the activation energy, and find that only the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) approximation agrees well with experimental reports and all other functionals largely overestimate it. Our calculations also show that an accurate estimation of the self diffusion coefficient requires explicit calculation of the effective jump frequency and vacancy formation entropy via phonons. Using accurate self-diffusion data and scaling all solute-related attempt frequencies with respect to the attempt frequency for self-diffusion using a simple relation involving the atomic mass and melting temperature of the solute yields solute diffusivities in excellent agreement with experiments, where such data is available. We find that large solutes spontaneously relax toward the nearest neighbor vacancy to relieve the misfit strain, and the extent of this relaxation correlates negatively with the migration energy. Thus, in general, larger solutes have lower migration energies and diffuse faster than smaller solutes in fcc cobalt. However, extremely large solutes, e.g., group III elements Sc, Y, Lu, tend to be trapped in an energy valley located halfway toward the vacancy, and monovacancy mediated diffusion may no longer be valid in such cases. Finally, for all the solutes considered, we systematically tabulate the diffusion-related quantities calculated-diffusion prefactors, migration and activation energies constructing an extensive and accurate first-principles database for solute diffusion in fcc cobalt.

TI Cyclic oxidation behavior of aluminide coatings on the Co-base
   superalloy DZ40M
SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB Aluminide coatings are prepared on a new Co-base superalloy DZ40M by low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LP-CVD), and their cyclic oxidation behavior is investigated. The results show that the coating degradation primarily results from Al-depleting to heal the oxide scale on the outer surface during the cyclic oxidation, unlike that primarily from inward Al diffusion to the substrate during the isothermal process. The effect of Ti on the oxidation resistance is very different for various intermetallic alloys, and the addition of Ti will increase the degradation for the present coating during high-temperature oxidation. These experimental results are helpful to clarify the understanding of the Ti-modification effect on aluminide coatings for Co-based superalloys. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Microstructural characterization of the M23C6 carbide in a long-term
   aged Ni-based superalloy
SO PHILOSOPHICAL MAGAZINE LETTERS
AB The microstructural features of M23C6 carbide in a long-term aged heat- and corrosion-resistant Ni-based superalloy have been investigated in detail using various kinds of transmission electron microscope (TEM) techniques. It is found that TEM contrast, which is related to structural and chemical inhomogeneities inside the grains, always exists in the interior of grains in the alloy. The structure of these inhomogeneous regions has been determined to be the same as that of the and t-M23C6 phases, where t-M23C6 indicates a transitional and metastable phase. Although possessing the same structure as the M23C6 phase, the chemical composition of the t-M23C6 is different from that of the M23C6 phase. Compared with M23C6, t-M23C6 is richer in Ni, Co, Al and Ti but poorer in W, Mo and Cr. This phenomenon of structural and chemical inhomogeneity demonstrates that pristine M23C6 carbide (p-M23C6) precipitated in standard heat-treated samples is unstable. Therefore, upon long-term ageing treatment, Ni, Co, Al and Ti may locally enrich inside the p-M23C6 phase, finally forming the phase, which can be described by the decomposition reaction p-M23C6M23C6+.

TI DEVELOPMENT OF NI-BASED DS SUPERALLOY WITH EXCELLENT OXIDATION

CY SEP 09-13, 2012

SP TMS
AB In advanced industrial gas-turbine systems, there is a great demand for a new, excellent superalloy which can be used for large gas-turbine blades. Because it is very difficult to produce a large-scale Ni-based Single Crystal (SC) blade, we have developed new Directionally Solidified (DS) superalloys with an excellent combination of high-temperature creep strength, low-cycle-fatigue strength, good oxidation resistance, castability and hot-corrosion resistance. In this study, three kinds of Ni-based DS superalloys were designed with the aid of the d-electrons concept. The chemical compositions of these alloys were in the range of 1.4%Ti, 8.2%Cr, 11%Co, (0-1.0)%Ru, 3.6%Ta, 9.2%W, 1.0%Re, 5.2%Al, 1.40%Hf and balanced Ni in weight percent (wt%). Creep rupture tests, hot-corrosion burner-rig tests, low-cyclefatigue tests and oxidation tests were conducted with heat-treated DS specimens of these alloys. Two of the designed alloys showed the same level of creep rupture life as those of the 2nd generation DS superalloys currently in wide use. Oxidation tests at 1313K proved that the oxidation resistance of all the designed alloys was superior to that of all the reference alloys. The results of the hot-corrosion burner-rig tests showed that all the designed alloys had better corrosion resistance than the 2nd generation DS superalloys. As for Low-Cycle-Fatigue (LCF) strength, it was found that even 0.6%Ru addition greatly improved LCF strength, and the 0.6%Ru containing Alloy-B showed better LCF strength than any commercially used reference DS superalloys. A casting test was accomplished in a model bucket of a first stage blade of a 25MW-class gas turbine.
   Alloy-B is potentially a suitable alloy for making gas turbine blades with prolonged lifetimes and low maintenance costs in recent 1500 degrees C-class or even higher class gas turbines for power generation.

TI Interdiffusion and Atomic Mobilities in fcc Co-Cr-Mo Alloys
SO JOURNAL OF PHASE EQUILIBRIA AND DIFFUSION
AB The diffusion couples of Co-Cr-Mo ternary alloys were prepared and annealed at 1473 K for 72 h in order to determine the interdiffusion coefficients by using the electron probe microanalysis combined with Whittle and Green method. The experimental interdiffusion coefficients were critically assessed to the atomic mobilities by means of DICTRA software package. Good agreements were obtained from comprehensive comparison between the model-predicted diffusion properties and the experimental data, meanwhile, considered that the calculated diffusion coefficients were within the acceptable uncertainty of the experimentally measured diffusion coefficients, which verified the reliability of the atomic mobilities. The diffusion phenomena, such as diffusion paths and the concentration-distance profiles in the Co-Cr-Mo ternary system can be reasonably described by the presently obtained atomic mobilities.

TI Evolution of Microstructures and Properties of a New gamma/gamma '
   Co-Based Superalloy via Forging Process
SO JOM
AB A new gamma/gamma ' Co-based superalloy has been developed with a large temperature range between the gamma ' solvus and solidus temperature, which can be formed through the conventional casting and wrought processing route. The microstructure, mechanical and corrosion resistance properties of this new gamma/gamma ' Co-based superalloy are characterized in the present study. The results show that even in the forged state, the partial recrystallization and grain growth processes occur, but the gamma ' precipitates remain very fine. Forging and aging increase the mechanical strength and facilitate the formation of stable passive films due to decreased low-angle boundaries and increased sigma 3 twin boundaries. The twin boundaries are beneficial for improving both the mechanical properties and corrosion resistance, which provides guidance for tailoring the microstructure and properties of novel Co-based superalloys.

TI Comparison of oxidation resistance of NiCoCrAlTaY-coated and -uncoated
   Mar-M247 superalloys in the air at 1150 degrees C
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Oxidation resistance of NiCoCrAlTaY coated and uncoated Mar-M247 superalloys were compared experimentally in the air at 1150 A degrees C. It was found that the oxidation behavior of the NiCoCrAlTaY coated and uncoated Mar-M247 superalloys generally followed the parabolic kinetics with the rate of 1.5 and 9.8 x 10(-3) mg(2)/cm(4) h for each one. Microstructural observation and elemental analysis indicated that after 200 h the uncoated alloy covered with an oxide scale of 6-10 times thicker than the coated one, beneath which a fairly continuous and relatively thin alpha-Al2O3 could be found along the interface close to the substrate. Comparatively, the NiCoCrAlTaY coated alloy uniformly produced the continuous, dense and thick alpha-Al2O3 layer adhesive to the coating to prevent the metal elements against excessive oxidation, and finally formed the steady oxide scales: outer (Ni, Co)(Al, Cr)(2)O-4 spinels, NiO, (Al, Cr)(2)Ni-3; inner protective alpha-Al2O3 with a little Cr2O3. On the surface of the uncoated alloy, however, it mainly formed the Ni-rich oxides in which a large quantity of cracks propagated to result in the more oxidation.

TI Elastic Properties of Novel Co- and CoNi-Based Superalloys Determined
   through Bayesian Inference and Resonant Ultrasound Spectroscopy
SO METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND
   MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Bayesian inference is employed to precisely evaluate single crystal elastic properties of novel gamma gamma' Co- and CoNi-based superalloys from simple and non-destructive resonant ultrasound spectroscopy (RUS) measurements. Nine alloys from three Co-, CoNi-, and Ni-based alloy classes were evaluated in the fully aged condition, with one alloy per class also evaluated in the solution heat-treated condition. Comparisons are made between the elastic properties of the three alloy classes and among the alloys of a single class, with the following trends observed. A monotonic rise in the c(44) (shear) elastic constant by a total of 12 pct is observed between the three alloy classes as Co is substituted for Ni. Elastic anisotropy (A) is also increased, with a large majority of the nearly 13 pct increase occurring after Co becomes the dominant constituent. Together the five CoNi alloys, with Co:Ni ratios from 1:1 to 1.5:1, exhibited remarkably similar properties with an average A 1.8 pct greater than the Ni-based alloy CMSX-4. Custom code demonstrating a substantial advance over previously reported methods for RUS inversion is also reported here for the first time. CmdStan-RUS is built upon the open-source probabilistic programing language of Stan and formulates the inverse problem using Bayesian methods. Bayesian posterior distributions are efficiently computed with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), while initial parameterization is randomly generated from weakly informative prior distributions. Remarkably robust convergence behavior is demonstrated across multiple independent HMC chains in spite of initial parameterization often very far from actual parameter values. Experimental procedures are substantially simplified by allowing any arbitrary misorientation between the specimen and crystal axes, as elastic properties and misorientation are estimated simultaneously.

TI Experimental and Computational Study of Interdiffusion for fcc Ni-Co-W
   Alloys
SO JOURNAL OF PHASE EQUILIBRIA AND DIFFUSION
AB By means of the diffusion couple technique, electron probe micro-analyzer measurement and diffusion controlled transformation simulation, the interdiffusion behavior of ternary fcc Ni-Co-W alloys has been investigated. In the present work, the concentration profiles of fcc Ni-Co-W diffusion couples annealed at the temperatures of 1273, 1373 and 1523 K for the whole Ni-Co edge (i.e. W-poor) region of the fcc phase were measured. Based on the concentration profiles, the interdiffusion coefficients were deduced and used to assess the diffusion mobilities in conjunction with the thermodynamic description. The calculated diffusivities and experimental diffusion coefficients agree well. In addition, validation of the diffusion mobilities have been performed by further comparing the calculated concentration profiles and diffusion paths with the experiment data obtained in the present work.

AB Standard reactive element (RE) studies have characterized the behavior of single RE additions such as Y, La or Hf. However, several commercial alumina-forming alloys are "co-doped" with two or more RE additions which allows the total amount of RE dopant in the alloy to be reduced. The oxidation performance of both commercial and laboratory-made co-doped alloys shows better scale adhesion and/or slower scale growth rates than comparable alloys with one RE addition. Characterization of the alumina scales showed no significant change in the grain structure with co-doping; however, as the total RE addition was reduced in co-doped alloys, a smaller volume of RE-rich oxides was observed within the scale. Quantification of the amount of RE ionic segregation on alumina scale grain boundaries formed on single doped and co-doped alloys showed similar amounts of segregation.

TI Interdiffusivities and atomic mobilities in FCC Co-Mo-W alloys
SO CALPHAD-COMPUTER COUPLING OF PHASE DIAGRAMS AND THERMOCHEMISTRY
AB By employing six groups of bulk diffusion couples together with electron probe microanalysis technique, the composition dependence of ternary interdiffusion coefficients in Co-rich fcc Co-Mo-W alloys at 1373 K was determined via the Whittle and Green method. The experimental interdiffusion coefficients were critically assessed to obtain the atomic mobilities of Co, Mo and Win fcc Co-Mo-W alloys by using the DICTRA (Diffusion-Controlled TRAnsformations) software package. Comprehensive comparisons between the calculated and experimental data show that a good agreement is obtained for diffusivities in binary Co-Mo and ternary Co-Mo-W systems. In addition, a further verification of the obtained atomic mobilities was carried out through comparing the model-predicted concentration profiles/diffusion paths of several diffusion couples with the corresponding experimental data. The results indicate that the atomic mobilities can reproduce the experiment data reasonably well. This work contributes to the establishment of a Co-based kinetic database for computational design of superalloys. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

SO CORROSION SCIENCE
AB Surface Cr oxidation mechanism of Alloy 617 was investigated in He-CO-CO2 environments with P-co/P-co2 of either 9 or 1320 at temperatures 750-850 degrees C. The activation energy for surface oxidation was 169.0 +/- 13.2 kJ/mol in He-P-co/P-co2 = 9 and 234.4 +/- 8.9 kJ/mol in He-P-co/P-co2 = 1320. The ambient oxygen partial pressure dependence of the measured oxidation rates was consistent with n-type behavior of Cr2O3, in which Cr interstitials are the primary mobile species. The oxidation rates measured were greater than that can be sustained only by lattice diffusion of Cr in Cr2O3, indicating that grain boundary diffusion of Cr plays a role in the Cr2O3 growth kinetics.

AB The microstructural evolution of Ni-20 pct Cr wires was studied during pack cementation where Al and Ti, with and without prior cementation with Mo, are deposited to the surface of the Ni-Cr wires and subsequently homogenized in their volumes. Mo deposition promotes the formation of Kirkendall pores and subsequent co-deposition of Al and Ti creates a triple-layered diffusional coating on the wire surface. Subsequent homogenization drives the alloying element to distribute evenly in the wires which upon further heat treatment exhibit the gamma + gamma' superalloy structure. Unexpectedly, formation of cellular structures is observed at some of the boundaries between primary gamma' grains and gamma matrix grains. Based on additional features (i.e., ordered but not perfectly periodic structure, confinement at gamma + gamma' phase boundaries as a cellular film with 100 nm width, as well as lack of topologically close-packed phases), and considering that similar, but much larger, microstructures were reported in commercial superalloys, it is concluded that the present cellular structure solidified as a thin film, composed of eutectic gamma + gamma' and from which the gamma' phase was subsequently etched, which was created by incipient melting of a region near the phase boundary with high solute segregation.

TI Fundamental investigation of the degradation laws of aluminide coatings
   during high-temperature oxidation
SO MATERIALS AND CORROSION-WERKSTOFFE UND KORROSION
AB During high-temperature oxidation, the aluminide coating degrades by two mechanisms, one is the oxidation of the outer surface, and the other is A1 diffusion into the substrate. The relevant laws are investigated for coatings on Co-base superalloys oxidised in air at high temperatures. The driving force mainly comes from the oxidation reaction for the outer degradation layer, and the chemical potential for the inner degradation layer. By an approximation approach, it can be concluded that the life of the outward-diffusion coating is roughly directly proportional to the second power of the main-phase thickness of the coating.

TI Microstructure and oxidation behavior of Al plus Si co-deposited
   coatings on nickel-based superalloys
SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB Diffusion coatings have been widely used to metallic protective coatings or bond coats in thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) to protect the aeronautical turbine blades from detrimental oxidation and hot corrosion. However, degradation of these coatings caused by oxidation or hot corrosion can be particularly severe and rapid in the operating environment of the turbine. We present an experiment to modify gamma-Ni + gamma'-Ni3Al coating by co-deposition of Al and Si in order to improve the performance of coatings. In this study, microstructure and oxidation behavior of Al and Si co-deposited diffusion coatings were investigated. These coatings were deposited by Pt electroplating followed by aluminization and siliconization using the pack cementation process. The composition (in wt.%) of the packs was 2Al-4NH(4)Cl-xSi-(94 - x)Al2O3 with different Si contents (x = 4, 6, 8 and 10) and the corresponding microstructure of the coatings was delta-Ni2Si. The isothermal oxidation tests at 1000 degrees C in air indicated that the coating formed using the packs containing 10 wt.% Si had optimal oxidation resistance. After oxidation, the microstructure of the coatings was that of Cr2NiO4 + NiO or NiO + Al2O3. The mechanisms through which Si-rich coating forms and protects against oxidation are discussed.

AB In this work, statistical analyses are conducted to measure the stacking fault density and stacking fault energy in a Ni-Co-based superalloy at different deformation temperatures and strain rates. High stacking fault density and low stacking fault energy indicate that the dynamic strain aging effects are caused by Suzuki segregation, which is enhanced by serious intersections of stacking faults in the superalloy. These results provide new insight into understanding stacking fault effects on dynamic strain aging in engineering alloys. (C) 2014 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Effect of Mo content on the microstructure and stress rupture of a Ni

SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB Ni base single crystal superalloys of three kinds of Mo content were prepared by screw selecting method. The microstructures and stress rupture properties of the superalloys with 2%, 3% and 4% Mo were compared. The results showed that as-cast structures of the three alloys were composed of gamma and gamma' phases. After heat treatment, mu phase obviously precipitated and grew in the alloys with 4% Mo, while only a few p phase in the alloys with 3% Mo, and in 2% Mo containing alloy no mu phase precipitated after heat exposure to 1100 degrees C /500 h. The mu phase was mainly composed of Mo, Re, W, Cr, Co, Nb etc., in which for the tendency of forming mu phase Mo is the strongest, Re, W, Cr are the second place and Co, Nb are the weakest. A lot of precipitation of rod-like mu phases damaged high temperature stress rupture properties of alloys. Due to a few mu phase no effect on the stress rupture property and the solid solution strengthening of Mo, the optimum Mo content should be 3% for the based alloy Ni-5Cr-10Co-4W-3Re-5.6Al-8Ta-1Ti-0.5Nb.

AB Interest in the use of laser technology is growing in the aeronautical sector. The implementation of new Yb: YAG solid laser sources and new optical generations (dynamic focal length; 2in1 fiber:Fiber core and ring core) offers advantages in terms of quality, accuracy, reproducibility and weld dimensions. The LASER beam Yb:YAG of these new sources is generated, no longer from a bar of yttrium-aluminum garnet but from a disk. Moreover, a top-hat shaped power distribution and a top-hat shaped power distribution with a sharply limited recess in the center (ring structure) may be at the focal point using respectively the inner fiber and the coaxial fiber. These technological innovations offer new possibilities for cutting and welding of sheet metal parts. The welding domains of EN AW-6061 aluminum alloy, Commercial Purity Titanium -Grade 2 (T40), AISI 321 stainless steel alloy, nickel based Hastelloy X and Inconel 625 and cobalt based Haynes 188 superalloys are defined according to process parameters such as power density, focal diameter, welding speed and fiber type. Optimal welding parameters are determined for each alloy. The evolution of the microstructures and the mechanical properties of each zone of the welds are explained according to the power density, the heat input energy and the welding speed.

AB Synchronous improvement of strength and plasticity (SISP) is realized for the first time in a precipitated-phase strengthened Ni-Co based superalloy through reducing stacking fault energy (SFE). Microstructure characterizations indicate that, with lowering SFE, the dislocation slip mode transforms from wavy to planar slip, meanwhile, the twinnability is also improved. Both the planar slip mode and the increased twinnability enhance the strain-hardening capability of the superalloy, which postpones the initiation of necking. Thus, the SISP in the double-phase superalloy is achieved.

AB Super alloys, which can be divided into three categories, i.e. Ni-base, Co-base, and Fe-base alloys, are widely used for high temperature applications. Since superalloys contain many alloying elements and precipitates, their chemistry and processing parameters need to be carefully designed. In this study, we designed a new Ni alloy to prevent corrosion due to water vapor and gases at high temperatures. The new alloy was designed using the theoretical value of the resulting energy electronic state calculation(DV-X alpha method). The components that were finally used were Cr, Mo, and Ti, with Ni as a base. For these alloys, elements were selected in order to compare their values with that of the average theoretical basis for an Inconel 625 alloy. Finally, two kinds of Ni alloy were designed: Ni-28Cr-4Mo-2Ti and Ni-20Cr-10Mo-1Ti.

SO RARE METAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING
AB Thermal fatigue properties of DZ40M directionally solidified cobalt-base superalloy was investigated by scanning electric microscope. The results show that the crack propagation rate increases and the thermal fatigue resistance decreases with the rise of the upper temperature. Resistance of thermal fatigue is improved with the holding time prolonging at the same upper temperature, which is caused by the formation of uniform and compact film of oxide on the surface. Due to different thermal expanding coefficients of the matrix and the carbides, crack holes are easily formed in the boundary of the matrix and carbides at alternating temperatures during thermal fatigue; as a result, cracks of thermal fatigue initiate. The interconnection of crack holes makes thermal fatigue crack propagate.

AB A continuous gamma/gamma' two-phase field has been identified extending between the ternary Co-Al-W system to the binary Co-Ti system. The lattice misfits of two phase gamma/gamma' alloys from the Co-Al-W-Ti quaternary system were measured by X-ray diffraction and found to be positive and vary linearly with composition. Differential scanning calorimetry measurements showed that the solidus and liquidus temperatures decrease from the W and Al rich end to the Ti rich end, whilst the gamma' solvus temperature increases. Long term heat treatments identified the occurrence of discontinuous precipitation at the grain boundaries in many of the alloys studied. The high temperature strength and creep resistance of the quaternary alloys in the intermediate composition range surpassed those of the binary and ternary alloys. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

TI PORE FORMATION IN P/M FERRITIC ODS SUPERALLOYS DURING HIGH-TEMPERATURE
   HEAT-TREATMENT .2. THERMODYNAMIC CONSIDERATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS
SO POWDER METALLURGY INTERNATIONAL
AB The pore formation in ferritic ODS superalloys was investigated.  Thermodynamic calculations were performed in order to obtain estimates of the pressures of gaseous species originating from the alloy system.  The CO pressures originating from dissolved or bonded oxygen and carbon are of the order of 5 . 10(-2) bar or less and thus cannot be responsible for pore formation.  The same is true for nitrogen.  Hydrogen from occluded water vapour could account for local high pressures but due to the high permeation rate of hydrogen, it is very unlikely that the pressure can be sustained for sufficient periods of time.  A model is proposed that could explain the mechanisms of both pore formation and growth.  The mechanisms comprise void coagulation around the primary oxygen-contaminated surfaces caused by stress-induced vacancy migration and oxide shell growth around the pore walls via a reduction mechanism of entrapped water vapour.  Experimental investigations which support these assumptions are presented.

TI Interdiffusion and the vacancy wind effect in Ni-Pt and Co-Pt systems
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS RESEARCH
AB In this study, bulk and multifoil diffusion couple experiments were conducted to examine the interdiffusion process in Ni-Pt and Co-Pt binary alloy systems. Inter-, intrinsic-, and tracer-diffusion coefficients at different temperatures, and as a function of the composition, were estimated by using the experimental data. Results show that in both the alloy systems, Pt is the slower diffusing species, and hence the interdiffusion process is controlled by either Ni or Co. The thermodynamic driving force makes the intrinsic diffusion coefficients of Co and Ni higher in the range of 30-70 at.%. The low activation energy for Co and Ni impurity diffusion in Pt compared with Pt in Ni and Co indicates that the size of the atoms plays an important role. The vacancy wind effects on the diffusion process are examined in detail, and it was demonstrated that its contribution falls within the experimental scatter and hence can be neglected.

TI Friction and Wear Characteristics of Single Crystal Ni-Based Superalloys
   at Elevated Temperatures
SO TRIBOLOGY LETTERS
AB The purpose of this study was to investigate the friction and wear behavior of single crystal superalloys at elevated temperatures. Pin-on-plate experiments were conducted using a custom-built high-temperature fretting/wear apparatus. Measurements were performed on two single crystal Ni-based alloys and Waspaloy (R) (used as a baseline material). The coefficient of friction for the single crystal materials (i.e., during running-in and steady state) was lower compared to the Waspaloy (R). In addition, the experiments showed that the friction coefficient of the single crystal is dependent on the crystallographic plane; the friction coefficient was lower for the tests on the {100} plane compared to the {111} plane. The wear behavior was aligned with the friction behavior, where the single crystal Ni-based alloys showed slightly higher wear resistance compared to the Waspaloy (R). Ex situ analysis by means of FIB/SEM and XPS analysis revealed the formation of Co-base metal oxide layer on the surface of the single crystal alloy. Similarly, a Co-base oxide layer is observed on the counterface providing a self-mated oxide-on-oxide contact and thus lower friction and wear compared to the Waspaloy (R).

   ENGINEERING
AB High-temperature corrosion behavior of plasma-sprayed aluminum oxide coatings on ASME-SA213-T-22 boiler tube steel at 850 degrees for 25 cycles has been studied. The Cr2O3 plasma coatings were sprayed at M/S Metallizing Equipment Co. Pvt. Ltd., Jodhpur. The experiments were performed in salt mixture of 60% NaSO4-40% V2O5 in silicon-carbide tube furnace. The experiments were done for 25 cycles, and each cycle consisted of 1 h of exposing the specimen at 850 degrees followed by cooling at room temperature for 20 min. The thermogravimetric technique was used to establish the kinetics of corrosion. Corrosion products were analyzed, and it was found that coated samples show better corrosion resistance behavior than uncoated samples at 850 degrees.

TI Segregation of alloying elements to planar faults in gamma'-Ni3Al
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB Systematic first principles calculations are performed to determine the interaction energies between solutes (Co, Cr, Nb, Ta) and stable stacking faults in gamma'-Ni3Al. Our results show that there is no obvious driving force for segregation to already formed SISF, SESF, or twin boundaries, which is in contrast to direct experimental evidence for segregation as provided by high spatial resolution structure and chemical analysis using scanning transmission electron microscopy techniques. This apparent discrepancy provides evidence for possible formation mechanisms of these planar faults via metastable precursor structures that are found to be attractive for solutes. In addition, we study the underlying reasons for the segregation in terms of size and chemical mismatch and find that a favorable change in bonding environment, rather than the solute misfit volume, dominates the solute/fault interaction energy.

TI Microstructure and oxidation behavior of Al and Hf co-deposition
   coatings on nickel-based superalloys
SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB This study focuses on investigating the microstructure and oxidation behavior of Al and Hf co-deposition diffusion coatings deposited by Pt electroplating followed by combined aluminizing and hafnizing using the pack cementation technique. The composition (in wt.%) of the packs was 2NiAl-2NH(4)Cl-xHf-(96 - x)Al2O3 with different Hf levels (x = 2, 6, 12 and 16), and the corresponding microstructure of the coatings was gamma-Ni + gamma'-Ni3Al, NiAl + Al16Hf6Ni7, Al16Hf6Ni7 and Al1.65HfNi0.35, respectively. In the post heat-treatment process, with Hf and Al diffusing towards the superalloy substrate and Ni diffusing in the opposite direction, Al16Hf6Ni7 and Al1.65HfNi0.35 were transformed into Ni3Al + Al3HfNi12 and NiAl + Al3HfNi12, respectively. The isothermal oxidation tests at 1000 degrees C in air indicated that the coating formed in the packs containing 2 wt.% Hf had the lowest weight gain, while the weight gain of the coating formed in the packs having 6 wt.% Hf was the largest. The mechanisms of Hf-rich phase formation and their effects on oxidation resistance of the coatings were discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Precipitation behaviors of gamma ', epsilon and eta phases in
   Fe-Ni-Co-Nb based superalloys
SO TETSU TO HAGANE-JOURNAL OF THE IRON AND STEEL INSTITUTE OF JAPAN
AB An Fe-38Ni-13Co-4.7Nb-1.5Ti-0.4Si alloy (alloy 909) and an Fe-29.5Ni-19.7Co-4.0Nb-1.3Ti-0.6Al-0.4Si alloy (alloy 929) are the latest low thermal expansion superalloys. This study was carried out to elucidate the relation between the age-hardening and the precipitation behaviors of gamma', epsilon and eta phases in these alloys by micro Vickers hardness test and transmission electron microscopy.
   The results obtained in this study are as follows;
   (1) In aging at 893K hardening proceeds gradually with aging time and reaches to the maximum hardness; the hardness after aging for 720 ks in alloys 909 and 929 are HV400 and HV460, respectively. The rate of hardening increases with increaseing aging temperature. After reaching to the maximum hardness the hardness decreases gradually because of the coarsening of gamma' phase and the precipitation of epsilon and eta phases. The precipitation and growth rates of these phases in alloy 929 are lower than those in alloy 909.
   (2) The precipitation in alloy 909 follows in a sequence of supersaturated gamma phase --> gamma' phase --> Widmanstatten epsilon phase --> cellular eta phase. That in alloy 929 follows in a sequence of supersaturated gamma phase --> gamma' phase --> Widmanstatten (epsilon + eta) phases.
   (3) The main constituent elements of the epsilon and eta phases in these alloys are Ni, Co, Nb, Ti, and Fe and Ni, Nb, Co, Fe, and Si, respectively. The epsilon phase contains more Co and less Ni contents than the phase. There is no distinct difference in the composition between the Widmanstatten and cellular eta phases.

TI Corrosion of various types of steel and stainless superalloys in
   tritiated water - Influence of tritium and radiolytic spaces
SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
AB To better understand the phenomena in metal equipment corrosion in tritiated water, a study of the behavior of oxide layers on a cobalt-based stainless superalloy was made in this highly radioactive medium, The oxide characteristics are modified from the corrosion potential, in passivity and up to the passivity and transpassivity limits. The corrosion of oxide sublayers, as exfoliation of the oxide, was shown. This would appear to be due to diffusion of tritiated species in the oxide. These species accumulate at the oxide-alloy interface, thus modifying the number of charge carriers in the oxide.

AB Molecular dynamics simulations were used to analyze lattice constant a, cohesive energy E-0, and elastic constants c(11) and c(12) of nickel-based superalloys with Al, Ti, V, Cr, Co, Ni, Nb, Mo, Hf, Ta, W, and Re additions. Interatomic potential parameters were evaluated for various additive elements, Ni, and Ni3Al so that lattice constant a, cohesive energy E-0 and elastic constants c(11) and c(12) could be reproduced. Changes of all physical quantities evaluated here were found to be proportional to the changes of concentration of additive elements. The dependencies were fitted by the linear least square method and the obtained parameters were saved as a database. The calculated slope parameters of the lattice constant were compared to measured slope parameters for various additives in the gamma phase. The measured slope parameters were reproduced very well.

SO METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND
   MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB The chemistry of the Ni-base superalloys used for turbine disks is critiqued by making use of the recently developed Alloys-By-Design computer-based tools. Compositions within the Ni-Cr-Co-Al-Ti-Mo-W-Ta(-Zr-C-B) design space are evaluated virtually. The assessment is made on the basis of sub-models for yield strength, creep behavior, oxidation resistance, and density; microstructural factors such as volume fraction and solvus temperature are considered where needed. The trade-offs between the different factors are studied in a quantitative sense. Diagrams are developed for the different alloy properties to highlight the limitations and challenges that one encounters when designing new grades of alloy or when optimizing existing grades. Composition-property maps are constructed that allow for an informed approach when defining an alloy composition. Specifically, the impact of chromium, molybdenum, and tungsten additions when mechanical behavior and lifing considerations are of concern is demonstrated.

AB Oxidized MC carbides which act as main crack initiation sites in a polycrystalline superalloy under thermal-mechanical fatigue (TMF) conditions at 850 degrees C were studied. Microstructural observations in the TMF tested specimens were compared to findings from bulk samples exposed isothermally in air at 850 degrees C for 30 hours in the absence of any external applied load. Carbides were found to oxidize rapidly after exposure at 850 degrees C for 30 hours resulting in surface eruptions corresponding to oxidation products, from where micro-cracks initiated. Plastic deformation due to volume expansion of the often porous oxidized carbides led to high dislocation densities in the adjacent matrix as revealed by controlled electron channeling contrast imaging. The high dislocation density facilitated the dissolution kinetics of gamma' precipitates by segregation and diffusion of chromium and cobalt along the dislocations via pipe diffusion, resulting in the formation of soft recrystallized grains. Atom probe tomography revealed substantial compositional differences between the recrystallized grains and the adjacent undeformed gamma matrix. Similar observations were made for the TMF tested alloy. Our observations provide new insights into the true detrimental role of oxidized MC carbides on the crack initiation performance of polycrystalline superalloys under TMF.

TI Laser brazing of a nickel-based superalloy using a Ni-Mn-Fe-Co-Cu high
   entropy alloy filler metal
SO MATERIALS LETTERS
AB In this study, we demonstrate the successful brazing and superior mechanical performance of laser brazed Inconel (R) 718 using a Ni-Mn-Fe-Co-Cu high entropy alloy filler metal with a nominal Ni:Cu:Co:Fe:Mn molar ratio of 1:1:1:0.25:1.75. A maximum 220 MPa shear strength is achieved. The high entropy alloy experiences the hardness increases 3-4 times after brazing. If the brazing temperature is higher than 1200 degrees C, the bonding strength suffers due to excessivediffusion between the base metal and the filler metal. The hardness behavior is attributed to a combination of the cocktail effect and lattice distortion induced by brazing. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB A first-principles approach is proposed to investigate the partitioning behaviors of the alloying elements Re, Co, and Cr, and the influence of Ru and Ir addition on them. The results show that Re, Co, and Cr all partition strongly to the gamma matrix. The Ru addition decreases the gamma phase partitioning trend of Re, Co, and Cr. The results are consistent with the early experimental work. Besides Ru, Ir results in Re less strongly partitioning to gamma. Our study shows that the influence of Ru (or Ir) on the partitioning characteristics of alloying elements originates from the strong interactions between Ru(Ir)-Re-Ni through the d-d orbitals hybridization.

TI Effect of Ru on the Solidification Microstructure of a Ni-Based Single
   Crystal Superalloy with High Cr Content
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB Ni-based single crystal superalloys have been widely used in manufacturing the critical components of aero-engines, such as turbine blades and vanes. Improvements in phase stability on the addition of Ru are well known in the field of Ni-based superalloy development. Cr is beneficial to hot corrosion resistance of Ni-based superalloys. Generally, superalloys which used under easy corrosion conditions should contain high levels of Cr. Early researches about the influence of Ru on solidification microstructures in Ni-based single crystal alloys are mostly focused on low-Cr systerms (<6%). Since Cr has complex interactions with Ru, it is meanful to study the effects of Ru on solidification microstructures in high-Cr (>10%) Ni-based single crystal superalloy systems. The materials used in this work are Ni-based single crystal superalloy with high Cr content. Three superalloys by changing Ru addition (0, 1.5%, 3%, mass fraction) were designed. By observing the as-cast structure, the effect of Ru on the elements distribution and the precipitation characters of different phases in these alloys were studied. It is found that as the Ru content increases, the primary and secondary dendrite arm spacings decrease gradually; the volume fraction of (gamma+gamma') eutectic increases firstly and then decreases; the gamma' size is reduced progressively. The addition of 3% Ru leads to the formation of beta-NiAl phase, which contain a certain amount of Cr, Co and Ru except the basic elements Ni and Al. The typical "reverse partitioning" of other alloying elements is exhibited with the addition of Ru, while the formation of b-NiAl phase can reduce the "reverse partitioning" of other alloying elements. The addition of Ru could enhance the segregation of positive segregation elements Ta, Al and negative segregation element Re while reduce the segregation of positive segregation elements Mo and Cr.

TI Deformation behavior of the cobalt-based superalloy Haynes 25:
   Experimental characterization and crystal plasticity modeling
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB The deformation behavior of a wrought, cobalt-based superalloy, Haynes 25, was studied using a combination of experimental techniques and crystal plasticity modeling. The microstructure was examined by transmission electron microscopy and electron backscattered diffraction to determine the deformation and hardening mechanisms contributing to the mechanical behavior of the alloy. A high density of stacking faults within the grains, consistent with planar glide, was found to be the predominant defect mechanism with no evidence of deformation twinning observed. A strain-rate and temperature-sensitive hardening law that includes effects of planar glide was developed for the material and implemented in a self-consistent homogenization scheme. The hardening of individual crystals is based on the evolution of dislocation densities per plane and includes the effects of strain rate and temperature through thermally activated recovery and dislocation interactions. The model is validated on a comprehensive set of compression tests performed at temperatures ranging from 298 to 673 K and strain rates ranging from 10(-3) to 2600 s(-1) and found capable of reproducing the stress-strain response and texture for all tests with a unique set of single-crystal hardening parameters.

   Ni-Based Superalloys: A Viewpoint From Interdiffusion Coefficients in
   Ni-Al-X Ternaries
SO METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND
   MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB A popular area of research in the field of high-temperature alloys concerns the search of substitutional elements for Re in order to manufacture single-crystal Ni-based superalloys with less or even no Re addition. To find the elements with similar or even lower diffusion coefficients than Re is an effective strategy. Based on 29 fcc diffusion couples in ternary Ni-Al-X (X = Re, Os, and Ir) systems, high-throughput measurement of composition- and temperature-dependent interdiffusivity matrices was performed using our recently developed numerical inverse method implemented in HitDIC software. The reliability of the determined interdiffusivities was validated by comprehensively comparing the model-predicted composition/interdiffusion flux profiles for each diffusion couple with the corresponding experimental data. Moreover, we also conducted a comparison with the interdiffusivities evaluated using the traditional Matano-Kirkaldy method as well as those from the literature and in boundary binary systems. After that, a comprehensive comparison of the interdiffusion coefficients in fcc Ni-2 wt pct Al-6 wt pct X (X = Ti, Co, Ni, Nb, Mo, Ru, Rh, Ta, W, Re, Os, Ir, and Pt) alloys at 1423 K to 1573 K was conducted. Results indicate that the diffusion rate of Re is lower than that of Os at 1473 K and 1523 K; but higher at 1573 K, while the diffusion rate of Ir is always slightly higher than those of Os and Re at 1473 K to 1573 K. Further analysis of the magnitude of the interdiffusion coefficient correlates with the alloying concentration, activation energy, atomic number, and atomic radius of different diffusing transition metal species (i.e., Ti, Co, Ni, Nb, Mo, Ru, Rh, Ta, W, Re, Os, Ir, and Pt) was conducted, which is expected to provide useful information regarding element choice in the development of new-generation Ni-based single-crystal superalloys.

TI Phase constituents in Ni-Al-Co-Ti quaternary alloys
SO INTERMETALLICS
AB The phase constituents in Ni-Al-Co-Ti quaternary alloys with compositions of Ni (18.2-90.8), Al (0-9.2), Co (16.6-83.1) and Ti (0-16.9)(wt,%) at 750 degrees C and 1100 degrees C have been investigated in the samples, which were prepared by mixing two base alloys (Ni-9.2 wt.%Al and Co-16.9 wt,%Ti). Experimental results showed that disordered fcc gamma and L1(2) ordered gamma' phases with a fcc/L1(2) structure formed in the quaternary alloys heat treated in the temperature range of 750-1100 degrees C. A partial isothermal phase diagram was plotted. The gamma/gamma' two-phase structure existed continuously from Ni-Al side (Ni-9.2 wt.%Al) to Co-Ti side (Co-16.9 wt.%Ti). The obtained results could play an important role in the design and development of new high-temperature materials with an fcc/L1(2) structure. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

SO RARE METAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING
AB The high-temperature oxidation resistance of Co-Al-W alloy, strengthened by a ternary compound gamma'-Co-3(Al, W) phase, was investigated. The kinetic data of mass gain and the cyclic oxidation behavior of the Co-Al-W alloys, including Co-9Al-7.5W (7.5W), Co-9Al-9.8W (9.8W) and Co-9.2Al-10.7W (10.7W), were studied at 800 and 900 degrees C by XRD, SEM and EPMA technologies, and they were compared with a nickel-base Manaurite900 (MAN900) alloy. The results show that the anti-oxidative ability of 9.8W alloy is the best at 800 degrees C among these alloys. But at 900 degrees C the square of mass gain of 7.5W and 9.8W alloys are much greater, while the anti-oxidant property of MAN900 and 10.7W alloys are superior to other alloys. The oxide scales at 800 and 900 degrees C exhibit a multi-layered structure, including an outer layer of Co3O4, an intermediate layer composed of complex oxides of Co, Al and W elements layer, and an internal attacked layer with oxides of Co and Al.

TI Interdiffusion and Growth of the Phases in CoNi/Mo and CoNi/W Systems
SO METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND
   MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Deleterious topological-closed-packed (tcp) phases grow in the interdiffusion zone in turbine blades mainly because of the addition of refractory elements such as Mo and W in the Ni- and Co-based superalloys. CoNi/Mo and CoNi/W diffusion couples are prepared to understand the growth mechanism of the phases in the interdiffusion zone. Instead of determining the main and cross-interdiffusion coefficients following the conventional method, we preferred to determine the average effective interdiffusion coefficients of two elements after fixing the composition of one element more or less the same in the interdiffusion zone. These parameters can be directly related to the growth kinetics of the phases and shed light on the atomic mechanism of diffusion. In both systems, the diffusion rate of elements and the phase layer thickness increased because of the addition of Ni in the solid solution phase, probably because of an increase in driving force. On the other hand, the growth rate of the mu phase and the diffusion coefficient of the species decreased because of the addition of Ni. This indicates the change in defect concentration, which assists diffusion. Further, we revisited the previously published Co-Ni-Mo and Co-Ni-W ternary phase diagrams and compared them with the composition range of the phases developed in the interdiffusion zone. Different composition ranges of the tcp phases are found, and corrected phase diagrams are shown. The outcome of this study will help to optimize the concentration of elements in superalloys to control the growth of the tcp phases.

TI Directional Diffusion and Influencing Factors of Elements during Creep
   of Nickel-Base Single Crystal Superalloys
SO RARE METAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING
AB By means of calculating the elements diffusion mobility and gamma'-phase directional coarsening rate of Ni-Cr-Co-W-Mo-Al-Ta single crystal superalloys with different compositions, the effect of element reaction on the rate of element diffusion and gamma'-phase directional coarsening was studied. Results show that during the gamma'-phase directional coarsening period, the rafted rate of gamma'-phase changes with composition and stress, and the rafted time is decreased with the stress increasing. The driving force of the elements diffusion and gamma'-phase directional coarsening during tensile creep are related to the applied stress and elastic modulus. Element reaction has effect on the diffusion rate of Al. As the total content of Ta+Mo and the ratio of Ta/W increased, the diffusion activation energy of Al is increased and diffusion rate decreased, and the rafted time of gamma'-phase is elongated. In the diffusion field of gamma'-phase directional coarsening, the formation of gamma'-order phase is attributed to the concentration of the atoms Al and Ta, which is a spontaneous process of the decreased free energy. The Al, Ta atoms with bigger radius are diffused to {100} planes to form the stable arranging order and the linking bond of the atoms with different kinds, which is a main reason of gamma'-order phase formation with Ll(2) structure.

TI Corrosion resistance of structural materials to Ga2O at 1000 degrees C
SO JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS
AB The thermally-induced gallium removal (TIGR) process is capable of removing gallium from oxide powders through the sublimation of Ga2O at elevated temperatures in a reducing atmosphere. Heat-resistant structural materials typically used in the construction of furnaces and reaction chambers may be susceptible to embrittlement and corrosion in the gallium-rich environment of the TIGR process. The susceptibilities of several heat-resistant structural materials to corrosion in Ga2O-rich atmospheres are experimentally evaluated. Tungsten and SiC are found to be highly resistant to corrosive attack by Ga2O at elevated temperatures. Superalloys containing chromium and cobalt as well as a tungsten alloy containing nickel and copper are found susceptible to corrosive attack by gallium. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

In this study a thermodynamic assessment of the entire Al-Co-Fe system has been made according to the CALPHAD method after a critical review of the relevant literature data. The order-disorder model has been adopted to describe the A1/L1(2) and A2/B2 phase relations, respectively. Thermodynamic interaction parameters have been optimized, considering the available experimental data, especially about the complex equilibria arising from the interaction between chemical and magnetic ordering in the A2 and B2 phases. Several isothermal and vertical sections have been calculated and discussed in comparison with experimental results in the whole composition range. A satisfactory agreement was obtained.

AB Nickel based superalloys have good oxidation and creep resistance and hence they can function under high mechanical stress and high temperatures. However, their undesirable tribological behaviour is the major technical barrier to the challenging high-temperature, lubricant-free plasma sintering tool application. In this study, nickel based CM247 superalloy surfaces were co-alloyed using innovative active screen plasma technology with both interstitial element (e. g. N) and substitutional alloying elements (e. g. V and Ag) to provide a synergy effect to enhance its tribological properties. The tribological behaviour of the plasma co-alloyed CM247 superalloy surfaces were fully evaluated using reciprocal and pin-on-disc tribometers at temperatures from room temperature to 600 degrees C. The experimental results demonstrate that the co-alloyed surface with N, Ag and V can effectively lower the friction coefficient, which is expected to help demoulding during lubricant-free plasma sintering.

TI Formation of microstructures responsible for remarkable properties of
   the Ni- and Co-based superalloys
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB This article, by the example of 3 superalloys, discusses the principles that should be followed in designing new multicomponent alloys. Experimentally, it was shown that these principles are as follows: 1. Chemical interaction between dissimilar atoms exist always, in all alloys and at any temperature of heating; 2. Alloys have a not previously known property of changing the sign of the chemical interaction at a change of the temperature, subsequently leading to a change in the type of microstructures; 3. A model of pairwise interaction is realized in multicomponent alloys, according to which the chemical interaction between dissimilar atoms (which exists within each of the diffusion couples of a multi component alloy), occurs similarly to the chemical interaction in a corresponding binary alloy. Using this approach, it has been found experimentally that the process of partitioning of a multicomponent alloy into diffusion couples takes place in the liquid solution. It has been found that the remarkable properties of alloys of the Hastelloy and Tribaloy types are manifested by the fact that the tendency to phase separation takes place in the majority of their diffusion couples. It is shown that the formation of multicomponent chemical compounds (Laves phases) under conditions where in alloys there is a tendency to phase separation is impossible.

TI Vacancy effect on the generalized stacking fault energy of alloyed
   gamma-Ni system: A first-principles study
SO COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB It is of great importance to explore alternative alloying elements to replace rhenium (Re) for the design of low-cost Ni-based single crystal (SC) superalloys. Due to the partitioning of Re to gamma matrix, the individual and the combined effects of the single (vacancy, Mo, W and Re) and solute-vacancy complex (Mo-Va, W-Va and Re-Va) defects on the plasticity of gamma-Ni have been studied by the first-principles calculations of generalized stacking fault energies (GSFE). It is found that a single vacancy and an alloying solute Mo/W/Re at the fault plane decreases the intrinsic stacking fault energy of Ni from 131 mJ/m(2) to 106 mJ/m(2) and similar to 97 mJ/m(2) respectively. Further reductions are made by the introduction of a solute-vacancy complex defect (similar to 80 mJ/m(2)). Furthermore, the unstable planar fault energies tuned by the Mo-Va and W-Va complex defects are almost identical, which are both slightly smaller than those by Re-Va. Finally, the calculated values of three twinnability measures elucidate that W and Mo provide similar enhancements in the twinning propensity of gamma-Ni to that by Re. This result suggests a possibility of partly replacing Re by Mo or W in Ni-based SC superalloys.

TI Overview on Recent Developments of Bondcoats for Plasma-Sprayed Thermal
   Barrier Coatings
SO JOURNAL OF THERMAL SPRAY TECHNOLOGY
AB The performance of MCrAlY (M = Ni, Co) bondcoats for atmospheric plasma-sprayed thermal barrier coatings (APS-TBCs) is substantially affected by the contents of Co, Ni, Cr, and Al as well as minor additions of Y, Hf, Zr, etc., but also by manufacturing-related properties such as coating thickness, porosity, surface roughness, and oxygen content. The latter properties depend in turn on the exact technology and set of parameters used for bondcoat deposition. The well-established LPPS process competes nowadays with alternative technologies such as HVOF and APS. In addition, new technologies have been developed for bondcoats manufacturing such as high-velocity APS or a combination of HVOF and APS for application of a flashcoat. Future developments of the bondcoat systems will likely include optimization of thermal spraying methods for obtaining complex bondcoat roughness profiles required for extended APS-TBC lifetimes. Introduction of the newest generation single-crystal superalloys possessing low Cr and high Al and refractory metals (Re, Ru) contents will require definition of new bondcoat compositions and/or multilayered bondcoats to minimize interdiffusion issues. The developments of new bondcoat compositions may be substantially facilitated using thermodynamic-kinetic modeling, the vast potential of which has been demonstrated in recent years.

TI High-temperature site preference and atomic short-range ordering
   characteristics of ternary alloying elements in gamma '-Ni3Al
   intermetallics
SO PHILOSOPHICAL MAGAZINE
AB Remarkable high-temperature mechanical properties of nickel-based superalloys are correlated with the arrangement of ternary alloying elements in L1(2)-type-ordered. gamma '-Ni3Al intermetallics. In the current study, therefore, hightemperature site occupancy preference and energeticstructural characteristics of atomic short-range ordering (SRO) of ternary alloying X elements (X = Mo, W, Ta, Hf, Re, Ru, Pt or Co) in gamma '-Ni3Al 21.875 X 3.125 alloy systems have been studied by combining the statistico-thermodynamical theory of ordering and electronic theory of alloys in the pseudopotential approximation. Temperature dependence of site occupancy tendencies of alloying X element atoms has been predicted by calculating partial ordering energies and SRO parameters of Ni-Al, Ni-X and Al-X atomic pairs. It is shown that, all ternary alloying element atoms (except Pt) tend to occupy Al, whereas Pt atoms prefer to substitute for Ni sub-lattice sites of Ni 3 Al intermetallics. However, in contrast to other X elements, sublattice site occupancy characteristics of Re atoms appear to be both temperature-and composition-dependent. Theoretical calculations reveal that site occupancy preference of Re atoms switches from Al to both Ni and Al sites at critical temperatures, T c, for Re > 2.35 at%. Distribution of Re atoms at both Ni and Al sub-lattice sites above T c may lead to localised supersaturation of the parent gamma '-Ni3Al phase and makes possible the formation of topologically close-packed (TCP) phases. The results of the current theoretical and simulation study are consistent with other theoretical and experimental investigations published in the literature.

   at Ni3Al grain boundary
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB The dual-species model is based on the Monte Carlo simulation conjoined with the embedded atom method (EAM) potentials. The model suggests that during relaxation of Ni-3 Al grain boundary, the trace element atoms can be seen not only as segregating species but also as inducing species. As segregating species the trace element atoms segregate (or enrich) to the grain boundary, but as inducing species they induce Ni atoms to segregate (or enrich) to the grain boundary. Evidently, the model can explain why the trace element atoms and Ni atoms co-segregate (or co-enrich) to the grain boundary. According to combination of positive (as inducing species) and negative (as segregating species) effects, the model explains the most obvious Ni-enrichment phenomenon at Ni-3 Al grain boundaries.

TI Microstructural characterisation of oxide formation from MCrAlY coatings
   on nickel-based superalloys
SO MATERIALS AT HIGH TEMPERATURES
AB Nickel-based superalloys are commonly used in industrial gas turbine engines for power generation due to their ability to withstand the arduous environments. Coating systems are employed to increase the service life of components by increasing the oxidation/corrosion resistance and high temperature capabilities. MCrAlY coatings are a common coating system used, not only to protect the substrate from oxidation and corrosion but also to act as a bond coat for thermally insulating coatings. The 'M' in the MCrAlY coatings is generally Ni, Co or a mixture of the two, with Co being added to improve the hot corrosion resistance (in conjunction with Cr) and to make the coatings more ductile. These coatings work by forming oxides that act as protective layers against further oxidation (known as tire thermally grown oxide, TGO). Alumina is most commonly formed oxide from the MCrAlY bond coat, which acts as a reservoir of elements for the oxide formation.
   It is necessary to understand the formation and nature of the TGO as a function of composition variation in the coating. This mechanistic understanding can be used to inform modelling methodologies for both service life prediction and the development of new coatings. This research is therefore concerned with the effect of compositional changes in the MCrAlY coating and their effect oil the TGO formation. Various ageing temperatures and times have been Studied, representative of service conditions. The alumina layer has been studied, however, the formation of other oxides, including isolated spinels, has been characterised in detail. Microstructural observations were carried out using scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray analysis and electron backscattered diffraction. Higher resolution characterisation was carried Out using a dual beam focused ion beam scanning electron microscope for site specific TEM preparation and STEM/TEM for microstructural evaluation. The results are then discussed in the light of both the bond coat composition and ageing conditions.

SO SCRIPTA MATERIALIA
AB Macroscopically zero-strained twin lamellae are observed in a coarse-grained Ni-Co-based superalloy after plastic deformation. The twin lamellae presented as three layers of overlapping stacking faults with zero overall Burgers vector. The atomic stacking sequence in the twin lamellae is consistent with pairs of parallel stacking faults at neighboring or next-neighboring glide planes. The twinning is facilitated by the low stacking fault energy of the superalloy and the lengthening of stacking faults by shear stress from nearby stacking faults. (C) 2014 Acta Materialia Inc.

TI SURFACE MODIFICATION AND ITS INFLUENCE ON THE MICROSTRUCTURE AND CREEP
   RESISTANCE OF NICKEL BASED SUPERALLOY RENE 77
SO ARCHIVES OF METALLURGY AND MATERIALS
AB Superalloy Rene 77 is very wide used for turbine blades, turbine disks of aircraft engines which work up to 1050 degrees C. These elements are generally produced by the investment casting method. Turbine blades produced by conventional precision casting methods have coarse and inhomogeneous grain structure. Such a material often does not fulfil basic requirements, which concern mechanical properties for the stuff used in aeronautical engineering. The incorporation of controlled grain size improved mechanical properties. This control of grain size in the casting operation was accomplished by the control of processing parameters such as casting temperature, mould preheating temperature, and the use of grain nucleates in the face of the mould. For nickel and cobalt based superalloys, it was found that cobalt aluminate (CoAl2O4) has the best nucleating effect. The objective of this work was to determine the influence of the inoculant's content (cobalt aluminate) in the surface layer of the ceramic mould on the microstructure and mechanical properties at high temperature of nickel based superalloy Rene 77. For this purpose, the ceramic moulds were made with different concentration of cobalt aluminate in the primary slurry was from 0 to 10% mass. in zirconium flour. Stepped and cylindrical samples were casted for microstructure and mechanical examinations. The average grain size of the matrix (gamma phase), was determined on the stepped samples. The influence of surface modification on the grain size of up to section thickness was considered. The microstructure investigations with the use of light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) enable to examine the influence of the surface modification on the morphology of gamma' phase and carbides precipitations. Verification of the influence of CoAl2O4 on the mechanical properties of castings were investigated on the basis of results obtained form creep tests.

TI Development of Ni-based single crystal superalloys for power-generation
   gas-turbine blades
SO TETSU TO HAGANE-JOURNAL OF THE IRON AND STEEL INSTITUTE OF JAPAN
AB In advanced industrial gas-turbine systems, there has been a great demand for new single crystal (SC) superalloys with an excellent combination of high-temperature creep strength, hot-corrosion resistance and oxidation resistance. In this study, ten nickel-based SC superalloys were designed with the aid of the d-electrons concept. Their chemical compositions were in the range of 1.2-1.5% Ti, 3.8-6.5% Cr, 11% Co, 01.4% Mo, 6.5-7.4% Ta, 5.0-6.0% W, 3.6-5.4% Re, 5.1-5.5% Al, 0.12-0.14% Hf and balanced Ni in mass% units. A series of experiments such as creep rupture tests, burner rig tests and cyclic oxidation tests was conducted with the heat-treated SC specimens of these alloys. All the designed alloys were found to be superior in the creep rupture life to a second generation superalloy, CMSX-4. In the hot-corrosion resistance estimated from the burner rig tests, any designed alloys were comparable or even superior to CMSX-4. The oxidation resistance was very different amount the designed alloys, but some of them showed higher resistance than CMSX-4. Thus the SC alloys containing about 4-5 mass% Re had about 20 K higher temperature capability than CMSX-4, while exhibiting excellent hot-corrosion resistance and oxidation resistance.

TI Influence of high-temperature protective coatings on the mechanical
   properties of nickel-based superalloys
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB The low-pressure plasma spray coating process has been established in the field of gas turbines and is used for hot parts, such as turbine blades and duct segments, which are exposed to corrosive gases at high temperatures. Overlay coatings based on the MCrAlY alloy system (M is Ni, CO or both) are commonly employed as oxidation- and corrosion-resistant coatings. Mechanical properties, such as creep and fatigue lives, of various MCrAlY coating systems were investigated at high temperature as compared with the uncoated substrates, such as eqiaxis IN738LC, directional solidified CM247LC and single-crystal CMSX-2. It was clear that the MCrAlY coatings had no significant influence on the creep lives of substrates for the sake of superior ductility of MCrAlY coatings at high temperature. The low-cycle fatigue lives of MCrAlY coated superalloys at high temperature showed only a little superior performance in comparison with the uncoated results. However, the high-cycle fatigue lives of MCrAlY coated superalloys at high temperature showed inferior performance in comparison with the uncoated results. It was because that the low-cycle fatigue cracks initiated at casting cavities inside the substrate in both the coated and the noncoated cases. However, the high-cycle fatigue cracks initiated at interface defects, such as small pores and grit residues, between the MCrAlY coating and the substrate and grew into the MCrAlY coating, and then into the substrate.

TI Influence of transition group elements on the stability of the delta-
   and eta-phase in nickelbase alloys
SO MODELLING AND SIMULATION IN MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
AB To improve the high-temperature capability of 718-type wrought nickel-base superalloys, the gamma'-phase (Ni3Al) can be stabilized. However, this also reduces the size of the forging window because forging has to be done above the grand below the solvus temperature of the phase that is used to enable fine-grain forging, i.e. the delta-phase of Ni3Nb type or the eta-phase of Ni3Ti-type. Understanding the influence of alloying elements on the formation of these phases is therefore important. In this paper, density functional theory calculations at 0 K are performed to determine the stabilizing effect of aluminium and of the transition group elements on the stability of the delta-phase and eta-phase. Most of the transition group elements of 5th and 6th period stabilize the delta-phase, whereas the stabilizing effect on the eta-phase is weaker. According to the calculations, Mo, Tc, W, Re, and Os may be expected to stabilize the delta-phase but not the. eta-phase, whereas Al and Zn strongly stabilize the eta-phase. V, Zr, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, Cd, Hf, Ta, Ir, Pt, Au, and Hg stabilize both phases. For some elements (Cr, Mn, Fe, Co), magnetic effects in the d and especially in the.-phase are shown to be significant at the concentrations studied here.

AB The effect of ceramic shell strength on hot tearing susceptibility during solidification was inspected practicing investment casting of the cobalt-base superalloy samples with the same casting conditions, but different ceramic shell systems. Results showed that the lower the ceramic shell strength upon using polymer additives, the lower the hindered contraction rate, and the lower the hindered contraction rate, the smaller the hot tearing tendency. Optical microscopy and electron microscopy scanning revealed that the hot tear propagated along the last solidified interdendritic phase, and that the hot tear surface had two major modes: 1) the ductile region in the outer layer; and 2) the inner region of liquid embrittlement.

AB A multi-source ion-plasma deposition technique was used to create a series of three combinatorial libraries across the Co-Ni-Al-W-Cr-Ta composition space relevant to the formation of Co-based gamma/gamma ' microstructures. Alloys were isothermally oxidized for 1 hour in air at 1100 degrees C, and screened for Al2O3 scale formation using a high-throughput photo-stimulated luminescence spectroscopy technique. Select compositions were then analyzed in cross-section via EDS in the SEM and TEM. The resulting oxide microstructures are presented, and paths to explain their evolution are proposed. Compositions forming alpha-Al2O3 with thinner amounts of overlying oxides are highlighted. The thinnest scale observed was similar to 1 mu m, comparable to second-generation Ni-base superalloys oxidized under the same conditions.

TI Solidification and Segregation Behaviors with Solidification Rate in Co
   base superalloy, FSX-414
SO JOURNAL OF THE KOREAN INSTITUTE OF METALS AND MATERIALS
AB Co base superalloys have been widely used for the parts of gas turbine due to their excellent strength, thermal fatigue, oxidation resistance and weldability at high temperature. In this study, directional solidifications were carried out at various solidification rates, including 0.5 similar to 300 mu m/s in the Co base superalloy FSX-414. The cellular interface were formed at a low solidification rate, 1 mu m/s, and the dendritic interface was found at higher solidification rates, 5 similar to 300 mu m/s. As the spacing of dendrite structure decreased, the size and spacing of eutectics decreased. Dendrite arm spacing decreased with increasing solidification rates and temperature gradient. It was interesting to find the M23C6 eutectic microstructure formed between gamma dendrites. Composition analysis showed that Cr and W were segregated severely between the dendrites, which resulted in the formation of Cr-rich M23C6 and W-rich MC carbides.

TI Modes of tool deterioration during milling of 718Plus superalloy using
   cemented tungsten carbide tools
SO WEAR
AB Understanding the detailed progression of cutting tool deterioration is important in order to improve the milling of Ni-based superalloys. Therefore, a series of documented experiments have been conducted on alloy 718Plus using cemented carbide (WC-Co) tools. It has been observed that the commonly recognised build up layer in the initial stage does not significantly affect the tool deterioration process. Instead, from the beginning of milling, cutting forces/stresses could cause small chipping locally in the initially sharp cutting edge. Fracturing locally with cracks propagating outside the cutting edge along the flank face in the subsurface region could also take place and was consistent with the direction of the cutting force. There was an initial period of time during which a number of microcracks had initiated in and near the cutting edge on the rake face side. These cracks soon propagated resulting in extensively fracturing and blunting of the tool. Coating of the tools had provided little protection as in the cutting edge area the coating had broken away soon after milling started. The major tool failure mode was Co binder material having heavily deformed to fracture, separating the WC grains. Loss of strength in binder material at cutting temperatures is discussed.

AB ZrCo2 and HfCo2 Laves phases were found and characterized in gamma-gamma' Co-base superalloys using high-energy X-ray diffraction, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy. They formed during casting and are stable during long-term annealing at 900 degrees C. The ZrCo2 phase with a cubic MgCu2-type structure exhibits numerous nano-twins and stacking faults, while HfCo2 has a hexagonal MgNi2-type structure instead of MgCu2-type in contrast to literature. Their chemical compositions strongly deviated from stoichiometry and significant amounts of Al and Ware contained in these phases. These could affect the atomic radius ratio and valence electron concentration and thus change the structure of the Laves phases. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI EFFECTS OF HIGH-TEMPERATURE AGING ON THE CREEP-RUPTURE PROPERTIES OF
   HIGH-TUNGSTEN COBALT-BASE SUPERALLOYS
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB The effects of high-temperature ageing on creep-rupture properties were studied using cobalt-base superalloys containing about 14-20 wt % tungsten (W) at 1089 K (816-degrees-C) and 1311 K (1038-degrees-C) in air. A high-temperature ageing for 1080 ks at 1273 K after solution treatment caused grain-boundary and matrix precipitates of W solid solution and carbide phases in these alloys, and grain boundaries were serrated especially in the alloys with higher W content. The high-temperature ageing largely improved the rupture life in the alloys with higher W content, particularly under lower stresses at 1089 K, whereas it caused the creep ductility to decrease a little in the alloy containing 20% W. The high-temperature ageing also improved the rupture life without decreasing creep ductility in these alloys under higher stresses at 1311 K. Under the same ageing conditions of 1080 ks at 1273 K, the initiation of grain-boundary cracks was retarded in the solution-treated and aged specimens, as well as in the aged specimens with serrated grain boundaries, for the alloys with higher W content at both 1089 and 1311 K. A large amount of grain-boundary serration also occurred in the non-aged specimens of the alloys with higher W content during creep at 1311 K, and contributed to the strengthening of the alloys. The solution-treated and aged specimen had almost the same rupture strength as the aged specimens with serrated grain boundaries in these cobalt-base alloys. The rupture strength of the solution-treated and aged specimens largely increased with increasing W content under the lower stresses at 1089 K and under the higher stresses at 1311 K. A ductile grain-boundary fracture surface, which was composed of dimples and grain-boundary ledges associated with grain-boundary precipitates, was observed in the solution-treated and aged specimens, as well as in the aged specimens with serrated grain boundaries at both 1089 and 1311 K. The fracture surface of the non-aged specimens was a brittle grain-boundary facet at 1089 K, but it became a ductile grain-boundary fracture surface, as serrated grain boundaries were formed owing to grain-boundary precipitates occurring during creep at 1311 K.

SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Dissimilar transient liquid phase joints were fabricated between Ni-based GTD-111 and Co-based FSX-414 superalloys using a 50 mu m thick amorphous Ni-Si-B interlayer. The athermally solidified zone in the middle of joint contained the ternary eutectic of gamma/Ni3B/Ni6Si2B and few amounts of Ni3Si. The amount of eutectic phase was decreased by increasing the bonding time. The complete isothermal solidification was obtained at the joining time of 100 min. The completion of isothermal solidification was controlled by several factors including the diffusion of Si and B from the bonding zone into the base metals, the diffusion of Ti, Al, Co and Cr from the base metals into the bonding zone and proportional re-distribution of them throughout the joint. The width of bonded zone (about 80 mm) was greater than the thickness of interlayer due to the coupled diffusion and dissolution phenomena. After the homogenization heat treatment, an increase of 34% in shear strength of the joint was observed due to the uniform distribution of strengthening precipitates across the bonding area.

TI THE CRITICAL RESOLVED SHEAR-STRESS OF GAMMA'-STRENGTHENED NICKEL-BASED
   SUPERALLOYS WITH GAMMA'-VOLUME FRACTIONS BETWEEN 0.07 AND 0.47
SO ACTA METALLURGICA ET MATERIALIA
AB Gamma'-strengthening of four nickel-based superalloys has been investigated theoretically and experimentally. The critical resolved shear stress (CRSS) of under- and of peak-aged single crystals has been measured as a function of the radius and of the volume fraction f of the gamma'-particles. f ranged from 0.07 to 0.47. The observed variation of tau(p) (= contribution of the gamma'-particles to the CRSS) with f cannot be described by current models of gamma'-strengthening. The reason is an apparent increase of the gamma'-antiphase boundary energy gamma with f. This variation of gamma with f is tentatively interpreted as being due to the recently reported inhomogeneity of the composition of the gamma'-particles: their outer layers are relatively poor in Ni and Al and relatively rich in Co and Cr. If current models of gamma'-hardening are modified to allow for the variation of gamma with f, these models lead to satisfactory descriptions of the experimental data.

   MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB L605 (20Cr-15W-10Ni wt pct) and CCM (28Cr-6Mo wt pct) cobalt-based superalloys are candidates for a wide range of applications, from gas turbine components to biomedical implants. Attention is currently focused on the optimization of grain structure as an appropriate approach to increase yield stress without affecting significantly the ductility. In this study, the Laser Ultrasonics for Metallurgy (LUMet) technology is used to examine in situ the evolution of the mean grain size associated with recrystallization and grain growth during heat treatments from the cold-rolled state. The recrystallization process is completed at 1373 K (1100 A degrees C) for L605 and 1273 K (1000 A degrees C) for CCM. The subsequent grain growth rate in L605 is larger compared to CCM. Continuous measurements of the grain size evolution are found to be consistent with grain growth affected by solute drag. Through in situ measurements, the laser ultrasonic technology significantly accelerates the determination of metallurgical parameters allowing for fast optimization of process parameters required to meet specific applications.

AB Our current understanding of the properties of V-Si-B alloys produced by a powder and an ingot metallurgy route is reported. This novel group of materials with high melting points above 1900 degrees C and a low density of 5.21-5.85 g/cm(3) has been identified as a potential alloy system for applications at temperatures up to 1000 degrees C. A powder metallurgical V-9Si-13B alloy with a three-phase microstructure is introduced and characterized in terms of creep behavior in the as-received and annealed state. Annealing at 1300 degrees C leads to grain growth and improved creep resistance. For comparison, the same alloy composition is produced via arc-melting, yielding a coarser microstructure. Another powder metallurgically processed alloy having the nominal composition of the phase V5SiB2 is comparably assessed. Compression creep tests at temperatures between 900 degrees C and 1050 degrees C demonstrate that these novel alloys are competitive compared to Al-Ti materials and Ni-Co superalloys.

SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB The effect of alloying elements in the substrate on the interdiffusion processes between a NiCoCrAlY-coating and model Ni-base superalloys was studied. Four single-crystal substrates Ni-10Cr-8Al-X (wt%, X = 10Co, 9Ta, 6 W) were coated with a conventional NiCoCrAlY-coating and exposed to air for up to 1000 h at 1050 degrees C. The microstructural analyses (LOM/SEM/EDX) revealed a strong dependence of the coating degradation rate on the substrate composition. The coating applied to the ternary base Ni-10Cr-8Al alloy and to the quaternary Co-containing substrate degraded most rapidly while the Ta addition to the substrate effectively suppressed interdiffusion. The degradation phenomena such as beta-NiAl depletion and propagation of the secondary reaction zone (SRZ) were interpreted in terms of a thermodynamical analysis in Thermo-Calc and by using a CALPHAD-based thermodynamic-kinetic diffusion model.

The hierarchical scales of fatigue crack formation and their correspondence to strain-life relations were considered for cast A356-T6 A1 in recent work by McDowell and co-workers using a microstructure-property framework that related cyclic plasticity near debonded silicon particle and large casting pores to formation and early growth of micro structurally and physically small fatigue cracks. In this paper, we turn our attention to the analogous role of carbides, oxides or other hard ceramic particles in fatigue crack formation in nickel-base superalloys. Cyclic plasticity of a directionally solidified (DS) nickel-base superalloy is evaluated in the [0 0 1] orientation. The effects of loading parameters (strain amplitude, R-ratio) and microstructural parameters (nonmetallic inclusion shape, spacing, etc.) on local cyclic plasticity at microstructure-scale notches are evaluated. The effect of neighboring grain orientation on intensification of plastic strain around inclusions is analyzed, and functions are determined for relating applied strain to cyclic plastic shear strain near the inclusion/matrix debond (micronotch) that contributes to LCF crack formation. Use of such a framework for predicting microstructure-dependence of fatigue crack initiation life and its variability are discussed, as are additional mechanisms of microfracture associated with cumulative plastic deformation.

TI Experimental investigation of the phase equilibria in the Co-Fe-Ti
   ternary system
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MATERIALS RESEARCH
AB Phase equilibria in the Co-Fe-Ti ternary system were investigated by means of the equilibrated alloy method with X-ray powder diffraction and electron probe microanalysis. No ternary compounds were found. The experimental results indicated the existence of seven two-phase and one three-phase regions at 600 degrees C, five two-phase and two three-phase regions at 800 degrees C, and six two-phase and two three-phase regions at 950 degrees C. The solubility of Co in TiFe2 was determined to be larger than 54 at.% at all investigated temperatures, and the solubilities of Fe in TiCo3 and Ti2Co showed an appreciable increase with increasing temperature. The three-phase equilibrium in the Ti-rich corner at 800 degrees C was revealed to be ((beta-Ti) + Ti(Fe, Co) + Ti2Co) rather than ((alpha-Ti) + Ti(Fe, Co) + Ti2Co) reported in previous investigations. Based on the experimental data obtained in the present work, three isothermal sections at 600, 800 and 950 degrees C were established.

TI Alloying solid solution strengthening of Fe-Ga alloys: a
   first-principles study
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS D-APPLIED PHYSICS
AB First-principles spin polarized calculations have been implemented by using the Discrete Molecular (DMol3) package to investigate the strengthening effects of alloying addition including Nb, Mo, V and Co in a cubic solid solution of Fe - Ga alloys. Mayer bond order values were used to evaluate the atomic bond strengths in the alloys and were then used to assess the alloying strengthening characteristics. Results from the calculations suggest that the transition metal Nb achieves the best strengthening effect in Fe - Ga alloys. The solid solution strengthening follows a decreasing order trend from larger to smaller from Nb, Mo, V to Co. The effect of Ga on individual bond strength variations between Fe and alloying elements and also on alloying strengthening was examined.

   faults in gamma'-Ni3Al via first principles calculations
SO SCRIPTA MATERIALIA
AB First principles calculations are used to investigate the segregation behaviour of Co, Cr, Re, Mo and W to intrinsic and extrinsic stacking faults in gamma'-Ni3Al. It is shown that the change in stacking fault energy depends on local alloying concentration and is related to subtle changes in the electronic structure of the alloying elements and adjacent nickel atoms. The results are consistent with observed stacking fault segregation in commercial super-alloys and in particular the behaviour of Co and Cr. (C) 2015 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Nb is one of the common refractory elements added in Ni, Co and Fe based superalloys. This lead to the formation of brittle topological close packed (tcp) mu phase, which is deleterious to the structure. It mainly grows by interdiffusion and in the present article, the interdiffusion process in different Nb-X (X=Ni, Co, Fe) systems is discussed. The activation energy for interdiffusion is lower in the Co-Nb system (173 kJ/mol) than Fe-Nb system (233 kJ/mol), which is again lower than the value found in the Ni-Nb system (319.7 kJ/mol). The mole fraction of Nb in this phase is less than Fe or Co at stoichiometric compositions in the Nb-Fe (that is Fe7Nb6) and Nb-Co (that is Co7Nb6) systems. On the other hand, the mole fraction of Nb is higher than Ni in the same phase (Ni6Nb2) in Ni-Nb system. However, in all the phases, Nb has lower diffusion rate. Possible diffusion mechanism in this phase is discussed with respect to the crystal structure.

AB Increasing demand for more efficient power generation forces turbomachinery to operate at higher temperatures and compression ratios. High speeds combined with high temperatures make turbomachinery sealing applications even more challenging. In order to confirm sufficient service life, seal material pairs should be tested similar to engine operating conditions. The high temperature friction and wear characteristics of cobalt superalloys, Haynes 25, 188 and 214 sheets, rubbed against Hastelloy X pins are presented in this work. Tests are conducted at 25, 200 and 400 C with a validated custom design linear reciprocating tribometer. Sliding speed and distance are 1Hz and 1.2 Km respectively. Friction coefficients are calculated with friction force data acquired from load cell and the dead weight where wear coefficient is calculated through mass loss after the tests.

TI Enlightening from gamma, gamma' and beta phase transformations in
   Al-Co-Ni alloy system: A review
SO CURRENT OPINION IN SOLID STATE & MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Alloys based on the ternary Al-Co-Ni system have found their broad applications in high-temperature structural materials as well as functional materials due to the existence of three major phases-gamma, gamma', beta and the phase transformations between them. The knowledge of phase equilibria and fundamental understanding of phase transition behaviors are of great importance to the research and design of industrial Al-Co-Ni alloys. This paper provides a comprehensive review and discussion of recent progresses in Al-Co-Ni system including the phase equilibria investigations, catalytic properties, shape memory effect and mechanical properties of Al-Co-Ni alloys consisting of different intermetallic phases. The differences between experimental determinations of the phase equilibria and calculated results using CALPHAD method and first-principles based thermodynamic model are evaluated, where the existence of Nishizawa horn is also discussed. Finally, prospective research topics in Al-Co-Ni alloys regarding further experimental and theoretical studies are proposed. The review provides general references and suggestions for developing novel Ni-based alloys with desired microstructure and performance through phase transformations.

AB In advanced industrial gas-turbine systems, there has been a great demand for new single crystal (SC) superalloys with an excellent combination of high-temperature creep strength, hot-corrosion resistance and oxidation resistance. In this study, 12 nickel-based SC superalloys were designed with the aid of the d-electrons concept. Their chemical compositions were in the range of 1.2-1.5%Ti, 3.8-6.5%Cr, 11%Co, 0-1.4%Mo, 0-3.0%Ru, 6.5-7.4%Ta, 5.0-6.4%W, 3.6-5.4%Re, 5.1-5.5%Al, 0.12-0.14%Hf and balanced Ni in wt%. A series of experiments such as creep rapture tests, burner rig tests and cyclic oxidation,tests were conducted with the heat-treated SC specimens of these alloys. Almost all the designed alloys were found to be superior in creep rupture life to a second generation superalloy currently used in the world. For hot-corrosion resistance, estimated from the burner rig tests, any of the designed alloys were comparable or even superior to a second generation superalloy. The. oxidation resistance was very different among the designed alloys, but some of them showed better resistance than the second generation superalloy. Thus the SC alloys containing about 4-5 wt%Re had about 30 degrees C or more higher temperature capability than the second generation superalloy, while exhibiting excellent hot-corrosion resistance and good oxidation resistance.

TI INFLUENCE OF MELT SUPERHEATING TREATMENT TEMPERATURE ON SOLUTE
   DISTRIBUTION BEHAVIOR OF A NEW Ni-BASED SINGLE CRYSTAL SUPERALLOYS
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB Solute partition coefficient plays an important role in determining the microstructure and mechanical properties of Ni-based superalloys. Melt superheating treatment can greatly affect the melt structure and redistribution of solute atom in the melt. However, up to date, there are few investigations of the influence of melt superheating treatment on the solute partition coefficient, especially for the new-generation Ni-based single crystal super alloy with additions of Re and Ru. Therefore, in this work, the influence of melt superheating treatment temperature on the solute partition coefficient of a new Ni-based single crystal superalloy with Re and Ru elements under planar solid/liquid (S/L) interface under directional solidification conditions was systematically investigated by using EPMA. It was found that the distribution of solute elements, such as Al, Ta, Ru, Re, W, Co, showed remarkable change in both sides of the S/L interface with increasing melt superheating treatment temperature, but there was little change for the solute elements of Mo and Cr. With increasing the melt superheating treatment temperature, the concentration of solute elements for Al and Ta increased firstly and then decreased, but it showed an opposite trend for Re, W, Ru and Co. Additionally, the change of the solute partition coefficients for Ru, Co, Mo and Cr were small with increasing the melt superheating treatment temperature. The main reasons related to the above changes can be ascribed to that the variation of melt superheating treatment temperature affects the size of the atom clusters in melt, which gives rise to the variation of atomic distribution, and thus leads to the change of solute partition coefficients.

TI Suzuki segregation in Co-Ni-based superalloy at 973 K: An experimental
   and computational study by phase-field simulation
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB Suzuki segregation in Co-Ni-based superalloys is of longstanding interest. In this study, the development of widely extended stacking fault (SF) ribbons was confirmed in a Co-Ni-based superalloy aged at 973 K after deformation at room temperature, which supports the decrease in stacking fault energy (SFE) due to Suzuki segregation. In addition, the plastic deformation behaviors of Co-Ni-based superalloys with various Nb contents up to 3 wt.% were investigated focusing on the effect of Nb addition on dynamic strain-aging by Suzuki segregation. The negative strain-rate dependence of flow stress due to dynamic strain-aging became more significant with increasing Nb content; however, attempts to detect segregating elements by scanning transmission electron microscopy and energy-dispersive spectroscopy analysis were not successful. A phase-field simulation of Suzuki segregation suggested strong Ni depletion with segregation of Cr and Mo atoms at the SF, and the SFE can become negative as a consequence of the segregation. This agrees with the experimentally observed formation of wide SFs by the aging at 973 K after cold deformation. It is also suggested that Nb atoms are strongly depleted at SFs, and a small amount of Nb addition dramatically enhances Cr segregation, resulting in further decreases in the SFE, which is probably responsible for the observed enhancement of dynamic strain-aging by Nb addition. In addition, the local structural changes, such as short-range ordering and/or an in-plane ordering, accompanying the segregation were discussed as possible additional mechanisms for strain-aging enhancement.

AB The alloying system Co-Al-W-Ta is comprehensively investigated in the vicinity of the compositional point Co-9Al-10W-2Ta, at. pct. These investigations provided a large amount of quantitative information, which can be used for alloy development, namely, the compositional dependences of the gamma'-solvus, solidus, and liquidus temperatures; fraction of the extrinsic phases after casting; the compositional dependence of the gamma/gamma'-lattice misfit; the element partitioning between gamma- and gamma'-phases; and the two phase compositional area gamma/gamma' in the Co-rich part of the Co-Al-W-Ta phase diagram at 900 degrees C. It is shown that additions of Ta elevate the gamma'-solvus temperature and increase the gamma/gamma'-lattice misfit, but adding more than about 3 at. pct Ta results in a large amount of undissolvable extrinsic phases. Additionally, two Co-Al-W-Ta alloys with lower content of W were developed and solidified as [001] single crystals for mechanical testing in a temperature range between 20 and 1200 degrees C. These tests included measurement of the Young modulus, tensile tests with constant strain rate, and stress rupture tests. It was found that at temperatures up to about 750 degrees C the ultimate tensile strength of Co-Al-Ta-W alloys can be at the same level or even higher than of Ni-based superalloys.

SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Uncoated and coated nickel base superalloys designed for use in gas turbine blades and vanes were tested at 900-degrees-C in a high velocity burner rig. Diesel fuel, with an injection of 5 ppm sea salt, was used to simulate marine engine conditions. The uncoated alloys, namely, single crystal SRR99, CMSX-2, SX60A, and MMT143 and polycrystalline MAR-M002, IN 738 LC, and IN-100, were all severely attacked by oxidation and corrosion after only 100 h of the cyclic test. A high chromium level in the alloy improved the hot corrosion resistance, whereas high molybdenum and tungsten contents were detrimental. The degradation in the 900-degrees-C tests was much greater than that experienced in previous tests at 1100-degrees-C using aviation kerosene fuel. Simple diffusion aluminide, platinum aluminide RT22, and four overlay coatings (air plasma sprayed LCO22, LCO22 plus aluminising, sputter ion plated Ni-Cr-Al-Si, and electron beam physical vapour deposited Ni-Co-Cr-Al-Y) all protected the alloys. The Ni-Co-Cr-Al-Y coating failed after 400 h but the other coatings were still protective after 1000 h. A rank order for the coatings has been obtained via metallographic studies.

AB Co is considered to be one of the main ingredients in superalloys. Co is considered a critical element and its substitution is difficult due to its unique ability to form high temperature stable structures with high mechanical and corrosion/oxidation resistance. High entropy alloys (HEA) represent a relatively new concept in material design. HEA are characterised by a high number of alloying elements, in unusually high proportion. Due to their specific particularities, high entropy alloys tend to form predominant solid solution structures that develop potentially high chemical, physical and mechanical properties. Present paper is studying Co-less high entropy alloys with high potential in severe environment applications. The high entropy alloys based on Al-Cr-Fe-Mn-Ni system were prepared by induction melting and casting under protective atmosphere. The as-cast specimens were heat treated at various temperatures to determine the structure and property behaviour. Samples taken before and after heat treatment were investigated for chemical, physical, structural and mechanical characteristics. Sigma phase composition and heat treatment parameters had major influence over the resulted alloy structure and properties.

SO PROTECTION OF METALS AND PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY OF SURFACES
AB High temperature Co- and Ni-based metallic coatings were applied on samples of 310 stainless steel using plasma spray and high velocity oxy fuel (HVOF) methods. The samples were sprayed with Na2SO4, V2O5 and NaCl salt solutions and exposed in air at 900A degrees C to cyclic conditions with an aim to simulate an environment typically encountered in oil refinery operation. Extent of hot corrosion damage was assessed using gravimetric measurements while microstructure of the coatings was examined using scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. X-ray diffraction was used to determine phase constitution. The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the performance of specific coatings in hot corrosive environments. Experimental results indicate that the presence of V2O5 and NaCl serves to enhance hot corrosion while Co-based coatings perform better than Ni-based coating.

TI Microstructural Characterisations and High Temperature Oxidation Studies
   of Nanostructured Co-Al Coatings Deposited on Superalloy
SO TRANSACTIONS OF THE INDIAN INSTITUTE OF METALS
AB The microstructural characterizations and high temperature oxidation of magnetron sputtered Co-Al coatings on the superalloy substrate have been studied in the present work. FE-SEM/EDS and XRD were used to characterize the morphology and formation of different phases in the coatings, respectively. Thermo gravimetric technique was used to investigate the oxidation of the coatings, in air at 900A degrees C. The growth kinetics of the oxide layers was predicted using weight change of the coated sample measured during oxidation. It was found that the oxidation rate of Co-Al coated superalloy was lower than that uncoated superalloy due to the formation of continuous dense, adherent and protective oxide scale such as CoO, Al2O3, Cr2O3, CoCr2O4, and CoAl2O4 over the surface of the coatings exposed to air at high temperature oxidation, 900A degrees C. The microstructural features and phases of the oxidised coatings were used to elucidate the mechanism of high temperature oxidation.

TI Corrosion of metals and alloys in molten glasses. Part 1: glass
   electrochemical properties and pure metal (Fe, Co, Ni, Cr) behaviours
SO CORROSION SCIENCE
AB Corrosion of pure metals Fe, Ni, Co, Cr in molten glass was studied at 1050 degreesC by electrochemical techniques and thickness losses measurements. These two techniques are in good agreement. The electrochemical apparatus was used to determine the formal potential of some redox couples, to identify the corrosion reactions and to evaluate the corrosion rates.
   Among tested metals, only chromium is a passivable material. The passivation is due to the formation of a chromium oxide (Cr2O3) protective layer at the glass/metal interface. Then superalloys used in molten glass must contain a high chromium level to resist to corrosion. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI EFFECTS OF Re AND Ru ON MICROSTRUCTURE AND SEGREGATION OF Ni-BASED
   SINGLE-CRYSTAL SUPERALLOYS
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB The influence of Re and Ru on segregation and microstructure evolution during heat treatment has been investigated in four Ni-based single-crystal superalloys with varied contents of Re (3%-6%, mass fractions) and Ru (0% and 3%). The additions of Re and Ru lead to the more severe segregation of alloying elements in as-cast structures. However, the effects of Ru on as-cast segregation can be neglected after the stepwise solution heat treatments. The additions of Re and Ru lead to the lower gamma'-coarsening rate, more cuboidal gamma'-morphology and reduced gamma'-size. Electron microprobe analysis (EPMA) indicates that Al, Ta and Ni partition to the gamma'-precipitates, whereas Re and Cr strongly partition to the gamma-matrix. In comparison to Re and Cr, Ru and W show the less tendency to partition to the gamma-matrix. Additionally, Re increases the supersaturation of Re, Cr, Co and W in the gamma-matrix, whereas Ru only slightly suppresses the partition of these TCP-forming elements to the gamma-matrix.

TI Pre-oxidation of Inconel alloys for inhibition of carbon deposition from
   heated jet fuel
SO OXIDATION OF METALS
AB Exposure of superalloy surfaces to jet fuel at elevated temperatures leads to the formation of carbonaceous deposits and metal sulfides. The formation of stable oxide layers on alloy surfaces can reduce the activity of the constituent transition metals that catalyze the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons and the subsequent carbon deposit growth. The metals Ni, Cr, Fe, Mn, Al, Ti and Nb + Ta form thermodynamically stable oxide layers after oxidation above 800 degrees C under O-2 flow. In this study, we investigated the formation of oxides and spinels on three different Ni-base superalloys (Inconel 600, Inconel 718, and Inconel X750) and their activity towards carbon and sulfur deposit formation from jet fuel (JP-8) thermal stressing at 600 degrees C and 34 atm (500 psig) for 5 hr. Metal oxide formation during pre-oxidation and the behavior of pre-oxidized samples in thermal stressing were found to depend strongly on the minor element composition of these superalloys.

TI INFLUENCE OF SEGREGATION ON LIQUID DENSITY IN THE MUSHY ZONE OF DZ483
   Ni-BASED SUPERALLOY
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB Ni-based superalloys have been widely applied in advanced aeroengine as gas turbine blades and vanes. The freckles in superalloys formed during directional solidification have deleterious influence on the properties of the alloys. The generation of freckles is associated with the local liquid density gradient in the mushy zone, which is obviously influenced by microsegregation of alloy elements. However, the individual contributions of the various elements to the total density variation are still not well known. Therefore, the effect of microsegregation on the liquid density variation in DZ483 Ni-based superalloy was investigated by isothermal solidification together with liquid quench method. Solidification microstructures were observed by optical microscope and SEM, and the compositions of the solids and the residual liquid were determined by EDS. Based on the compositions of residual liquids; the densities of liquids at different temperatures were calculated. The results show that the onset solidification temperature of DZ483 alloy is a little bit below 1335 degrees C; and MC, which is enriched with Ta and Ti, formed at about 1325 degrees C. The segregation coefficients of different elements show that W and Co are negative segregation elements, Ta and Ti positive segregation elements, while Al and Cr show little segregation. The density of the residual liquid generally decreases as the decrease of temperature, with the exception that it increases somewhat from 1325 to 1315 degrees C. Calculation results show that temperature has insignificant influence on liquid density, and variation of density is mainly due to rnicrosegregation. Segregations of Mo and Ta lead to the increase of density, but segregations of Ti and W present opposite effect. Contribution of each element to the variation of the liquid density is analyzed. The sequence of contributions of alloy elements to the variation of total liquid density is Ti>Ta>W>Cr>Mo>Al>Co. The formation of MC consumes an abundant of Ti and Ta, resulting in the increase of liquid density from 1325 to 1315 degrees C.

TI Carbides in Co-Re-Cr-based high-temperature alloys
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Co-Re-base alloys with very high melting point are being developed to supplement Ni-superalloys in future gas turbines in which much higher gas entry temperatures are expected. The microstructure of Co-17Re-23Cr-2.6C and Co-17Re-23Cr-1.2Ta-2.6C alloys has been investigated by scanning and transmission electron microscopy. These alloys are mainly strengthened by carbides of Cr and/or Ta, but it is not trivial to accurately quantify the composition of the carbides. The compositions of the various carbides in Co-Re-base alloys were quantified with near-atomic resolution using atom probe tomography. The Cr as well as Ta carbides exists in the alloys with different morphologies, ranging from extremely fine (nm scale) to large (mu m scale) sizes. The composition and the crystal structure of the investigated phases were measured and reported. It is shown that both types of carbides are stable up to 1000 degrees C but the Ta carbides are more stable than the Cr carbides at 1200 degrees C after long-time ageing. They are also effective as strengthening precipitates.

TI Synergistic effect of co-alloying elements on site preferences and
   elastic properties of Ni3Al: A first-principles study
SO INTERMETALLICS
AB The site preferences of co-alloying elements (Mo-Ta, Mo-Re, Mo-Cr) in Ni3Al are studied using first-principles calculations, and the effects of these alloying elements on the elastic properties of Ni3Al are evaluated by elastic property calculations. The results show that the Mo-Ta, Mo-Re and Mo-Cr atom pairs all prefer Al-Al sites and the spatial neighbor relation of substitution sites almost has no influence on the site preference results. Furthermore, the Young's modulus of Ni3Al increases much higher by substituting Al-Al sites with co-alloying atoms, among which Mo-Re has the best strengthening effect. The enhanced chemical bondings between alloying atoms and their neighbor host atoms are considered to be the main strengthening mechanism of the alloying elements in Ni3Al. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Codeposition of Al and Si on nickel base superalloys by pack cementation
   process
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB The vapour pressure of halide species generated at high temperatures in pack powder mixtures containing Al, Si, halide salt and Al2O3 were analysed by means of thermochemical calculations in an attempt to identify suitable halide activators and pack ;compositions for codepositing Al and Si to form diffusion coatings on nickel-base superalloys by the pack cementation process. The halide salts investigated were AlF3, AlCl3, NH4Cl and CrCl(3)(.)6H(2)O. The results of thermochemical calculations suggested that compositions of pack powder mixtures activated by NH4Cl and CrCl(3)(.)6H(2)O may be adjusted to create deposition conditions favourable for codepositing Al and Si, but the pack powder mixtures activated by AlF3 or AlCl3 may only deposit Al. Guided by the thermochemical calculations, a series of pack powder mixtures activated by CrCl(3)(.)6H(2)O were formulated and coating deposition experiments were carried out at 1000 and 1100 degreesC. With adequate control of pack compositions and deposition conditions, it was found that codeposition of Al and Si could indeed be achieved at these temperatures. A mixture of elemental Al and Si powders may be used as a depositing source instead of using Al-Si master alloy powders as conventionally recommended. Depending on the deposition temperature used, the coatings could be formed either through the inward diffusion of Al and Si or through the outward diffusion of Ni together with other substrate elements such as Cr and Co with the respective coating structures associated with the two coating formation mechanisms. The pack compositions and deposition conditions may be adjusted to control the microstructure of the coatings formed by the codeposition process. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Determination of Cu, Zn, As, Cd, In, Sn, Pb, and Bi in nickel-based
   superalloys after multi-matrix separation
SO ATOMIC SPECTROSCOPY
AB A procedure has been developed for the determination of critical elements such as Cu, Zn, As, Cd, In, Sn, Pb, and Bi present at trace/ultra-trace levels in different types of Ni-based superalloys. These elements were quantitatively separated from a multicomponent superalloy (nearly 10 major constituents) by a solvent extraction method using 1M KI + 2M H2SO4 medium, then extracted into MIBK (Methyl Isobutyl Ketone), and determined by Inductively Coupled Plasma Quadrupole Mass Spectrometry (ICP-QMS). Significant separation of all the major matrix elements (Al, Ti, V, Cr, Co, Nb, Mo, Hf, Ta, W, Ni, and Re) has been achieved.
   Recoveries of > 95% were achieved for the elements Cu, Zn, Cd, In, Sn, Pb, and Bi, and 85% for As. Good agreement was observed for these results with the certified values of British Chemical Standard (BCS 346) and with the values obtained from the direct analysis by Glow Discharge Quadrupole Mass Spectrometry (GD-QMS).
   Reproducibility of the procedure is 20% RSD and the accuracy is within +/- 25% for the elements at trace levels. The procedure provides detection limits of 0.7 mu g kg(-1) (Bi) and 0.07 mg kg(-1) (Zn).

Cu addition to a FeNiCr model alloy lead to the formation of an almost continuous Cu layer at the oxide/metal interface, greatly improving the metal dusting resistance.

TI Comparison of thermal expansion and oxidation behavior of various
   high-temperature coating materials and superalloys
SO MATERIALS AT HIGH TEMPERATURES
AB The thermal expansion mismatch between a metallic substrate and its external oxide scale generates a strain on cooling that is a primary cause of spallation of protective oxide scales. This study compares thermal expansion behavior and cyclic oxidation performance of the two major composition classes of high-temperature commercial coatings for protection of single-crystal superalloys. The thermal expansion of cast MCrAlY (M = Ni and/or Co) alloys and cast aluminides (NiAl, (Ni,Pt)Al and Ni(3)Al) was measured at temperatures up to 1300degreesC and compared to that of a single-crystal Ni-base superalloy. The tendency for scale spallation from each alloy was evaluated by cyclic oxidation testing at 1150degreesC. The coefficients of thermal expansion for the aluminides were lower than those of the MCrAlY-based alloys at all temperatures and scale adherence to the Hf-doped aluminides was generally superior. Scale adherence to the various compositions of MCrAlY-type alloys did not directly correlate to their thermal expansion behavior or substrate strength. For both types of materials, the presence of a reactive element (Y,Hf, etc.) had no detectable effect on thermal expansion but a major effect on scale adherence. There was no obvious influence of At content on the thermal expansion of beta phase Ni-Al compositions. The addition of Pt resulted in a lower average thermal expansion for hyperstoichiometric (Ni,Pt)AI at temperatures above 930degreesC, but this effect was not observed in hypostoichiometric (Ni,Pt)AI.

AB Single-crystal elastic constants of Co(3)(Al,W) with the cubic L1(2) structure have been experimentally measured by resonance ultrasound spectroscopy at liquid helium temperature. The values of all the three independent single-crystal elastic constants and polycrystalline elastic constants of Co(3)(Al,W) experimentally determined are 15 similar to 25% larger than those of Ni(3)(Al,Ta) but are considerably smaller than those previously reported. Two-phase microstructures with cuboidal L1(2) precipitates being well aligned parallel to < 100 > and well faceted parallel to {100} are expected to form very easily in Co-base superalloys because of the large value of E(111)/E(100) and c(ij) of Co(3)(Al,W). This is indeed confirmed by experiment. Values of yield stress obtained for both [001] and [123] orientations of L1(2)/fcc two-phase single crystals moderately decrease with the increase in temperature up to 800 degrees C and then decrease rapidly with temperature above 800 degrees C without any anomaly in yield stress. Slip on {111} is observed to occur for both orientations in the whole temperature range investigated.

TI Atomic diffusion in liquid nickel: First-principles modeling
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB Self- and impurity diffusion coefficients are assessed in the liquid nickel system by the fundamental ab initio molecular dynamics approach. The impurity diffusion coefficients in the Ni-X systems (X=C, Co, N, Nb, Ta, Ti, W) are mostly not available in the current literature. The simulations are performed at four temperatures, in the range from 1903 to 2303 K, which allows to extract activation energies and frequency factors for the temperature dependent diffusion coefficient assuming an Arrhenius-type behavior in the liquid. In addition to the temperature dependence, the concentration-dependent impurity diffusion was investigated for the Ni-Co system. The data are of relevance for the development of the state-of-the art Ni-based superalloys and alternative binder systems in cemented carbides. The obtained theoretical results are in very good agreement with the limited experimental data for the diffusion in liquid Ni systems. Published by AIP Publishing.

SO CORROSION SCIENCE
AB The kinetic aspects of the competitive reaction of CO and H2O in the formation of chromia layer on a nickel base alloy at high temperature were studied by thermogravimetry combined to gas phase chromatography. It was shown that competitive adsorption occurred between both molecules and that whatever P-CO/P-H2O ratio, CO mainly reacted in the first instants of oxidation and H2O became the main long-term oxidant species. After an interfacial and diffusion mixed kinetic regime, the long-term oxidation rate was parabolic and did not depend on the water vapor content in the gas phase. The oxidation kinetics was well described by considering that the rate limiting step was the outwards diffusion of interstitial chromium cations in the oxide layer. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The static-immersion results reveal that the corrosion depth after testing for 100 h roughly remains at the same level for the alloys added with 5 wt.% Al or added with Fe, Ti and Nb (FeTiNb) separately, but decreases greatly by co-adding 5 wt.% Al with FeTiNb. However, a further increase of Al content to 15 wt.% in the co-added alloy degrades the corrosion resistance. The corrosion mechanism was discussed based on the analysis of the corrosion layer.

TI Microstructure, phase stability and mechanical properties of
   Nb-Ni-Ti-Co-Zr and Nb-Ni-Ti-Co-Zr-Hf high entropy alloys
SO PROGRESS IN NATURAL SCIENCE-MATERIALS INTERNATIONAL
AB Owning to their excellent thermal stability and high strength at elevated temperature, high entropy alloys (HEAs) possess great potential for the application in aviation and aerospace fields. In present work, two novel Nb-Ni-Ti-Co-Zr and Nb-Ni-Ti-Co-Zr-Hf HEAs were prepared by arc melting and copper mold suction-casting method. The microstructure, phase stability, mechanical properties at room temperature and elevated temperature of the two HEAs were studied. Both of the HEAs possess high yield stress at room temperature, especially for the Nb-Ni-Ti-Co-Zr (with 2331 Mpa). In addition, the Nb-Ni-Ti-Co-Zr HEA exhibited high yield stress of 564 Mpa at elevated temperature of 800 degrees C and large compressive plastic strain (more than 50% at 800 degrees C). Nb-Ni-Ti-Co-Zr-Hf alloy showed new phase precipitation at 800 degrees C, whereas the structure of Nb-Ni-Ti-Co-Zr was more stable, which is one of the reason why it possesses high strength at room temperature and elevated temperature. The high temperature properties of the Nb-Ni-Ti-Co-Zr HEA make it promising for high temperature application. (C) 2015 The Authors.

AB The microstructure and hot corrosion behavior of a Si-Y-Co-modified aluminide coating prepared on a nickel base superalloy DZ125 by the pack cementation process was studied. The Co-Al-Si-Y coated specimen had a mass gain of only 0.25 mg/cm(2) after being exposed to NaCl + Na2SO4 salt for 100 h at 1173 K. Thus the addition of Si to a Y-Co-modified aluminide coating increased its hot corrosion resistance by 40 %. The improved hot corrosion resistance of the Co-Al-Si-Y coating was mainly attributed to the formation of an Al2O3 scale with SiO2 on the surface of the coating during the hot corrosion test. SiO2 can prohibit the high fluxing rate of dissolution of the protective Al2O3 scale and prevent rapid corrosion attack owing to its low solubility over a wide range of salt acidity and its weak oxygen permeability.

AB With rising operating temperatures of gas turbines, interdiffusion may occur between the structural material of the blades (superalloy) and the corrosion-resistant layer (MCrAlY) leading to premature coating failure. Depositing a diffusion barrier between the base material and the layer is a conceivable means to suppress this diffusion. alpha-Al2O3 appears to be well suited as a diffusion barrier since it passes through no phase transition at high temperatures and possesses a hcp crystal structure with a very small number of defects. However, chemical vapor deposition of alpha-Al2O3 is known to be difficult because of preferred whisker formation due to the high contents of Ni and Co in the substrate. In this paper two ways to suppress the growth of whiskers and to deposit smooth alpha-Al2O3 films on nickel base superalloy substrates are presented. Furthermore, the efficiency of the diffusion barrier was tested by annealing experiments at 1100 degrees C for 100 h. The alpha-Al2O3 films remained dense and very effective as a diffusion barrier.

AB The isothermal oxidation behavior at 900 and 1100 degrees C in pure oxygen of several commercial single-crystal Ni-base superalloys (CMSX2, CMSX4, CMSX6, AM3, MC2, SRR99) and modified versions of some of them has been investigated. Oxide scales formed at 900 degrees C are adherent and reveal the dendritic microstructure of the subjacent alloy. These scales are composed of three layers 1- (Ti,Co,Ni)-rich oxides, 2- Cr-rich oxides and 3- (Ta,W,Ti)-rich oxides. Al-internal oxidation zone and y' depleted zone are identified. Oxide scales formed at 1100 degrees C are not adherent and spall off extensively regardless of cooling rate. The critical temperature drop to initiate spallation (Delta T) depends on the oxide layer thickness (xi) and the interfacial rupture energy (y(F)). For a given oxide/metal couple (Delta T)(2) xi/y(F), is constant (EVANS and LOBB model). AM3 and CMSX4 alloys follow this model while AM3 and MC2 modified alloys have different behavior. Addition of Si and Hf and substitution of Mo by Re or Pt and Ti by Ta improve oxidation resistance at 900 degrees C and scale adherence at 1100 degrees C.

TI Atomistic simulations of solid solution strengthening in Ni-based
   superalloy
SO COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB The interaction between an edge dislocation and the solid solution elements (Co, Ru and Re) of different concentration in Ni is investigated by means of molecular dynamics simulation. It is figured out that Ru atoms hinder dislocation movement more effectively than Co atoms under the same concentration. The solid solution strengthening of Re atoms being introduced to Ni crystal is obviously stronger than that of Co and Ru atoms addition. With first-principles density functional theory approach, it is found that one of the leading factors of solid solution strengthening can be attributed to the interaction between host atoms and solid solution elements located in the slip plane, which leads to the stacking-fault energy increasing.

TI Determination of thallium in nickel-based superalloys by ICP-QMS after
   multi-matrix separation
SO ATOMIC SPECTROSCOPY
AB A simple and rapid method is proposed for the determination of critical thallium present at trace and ultra-trace levels in different types of Ni-based superalloys by inductively coupled plasma quadrupole mass spectrometry (ICP-QMS).
   Thallium was quantitatively separated from a multi-component superalloy (containing nearly 10 major constituents) by a solvent extraction method using 1M HBr, then extracted into diethyl ether, and measured by ICP-QMS. Significant separation of all major matrix elements (Al, Ti, V, Cr, Co, Nb, Mo, Hf, Ta, W, Ni, and Re) was achieved.
   Recovery of thallium was found to be 99%. Reasonable agreement was observed for these results with the certified values of British Chemical Standards (BCS-346 and BCS-345) and with the values obtained from the direct and matrix-separation analysis by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (GFAAS).
   Using ICP-QMS, the reproducibility of the method was 10% RSD at trace levels and 20% RSD at low parts per billion levels. The accuracy was within +/- 15% at trace levels, and the detection limits achieved were 2 ng g(-1) for thallium.

It was observed that the mu phase distribute at interdendritic area and precipitate mainly from the gamma' phase in this experimental alloy. Orientation relationship between the gamma and the mu phase was found as (111)gamma parallel to (0001)(mu) and < 110 >(gamma) parallel to < 11 (2) over bar0 >(mu).

TI Neutron and synchrotron probes in the development of Co-Re-based alloys
   for next generation gas turbines with an emphasis on the influence of
   boron additives
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED CRYSTALLOGRAPHY
AB Nickel-based superalloys are the materials of choice in the hot section of current gas turbines, but they are reaching temperature limits constrained by their melting temperature range. Co-Re alloy development was prompted by a search for new materials for future gas turbines, where the temperature of application will be considerably higher. Addition of the very high melting point refractory metal Re to Co can increase the melting range of Co alloys to much higher temperatures than the commercial Co alloys in use today. The alloy development strategy is first discussed very briefly. In this program, model ternary and quaternary compositions were studied in order to develop a basic understanding of the alloy system. In situ neutron and synchrotron measurements (small and wide angle) at high temperatures were extensively used for this purpose and some selected results from the in situ measurements are presented. In particular, the effect of boron doping in Co-Re-Cr alloys and the stability of the TaC precipitates at high temperatures were investigated. A fine dispersion of TaC precipitates strengthens some Co-Re alloys, and their stability at the application temperature is critical for the long-term creep properties.

Under all conditions the alloys underwent significant attack with formation of scales containing both Fe and Al. However corrosion in Na2SO4 pure or mixed with NaCl slowed down significantly with time, while corrosion in Na2SO4-V2O5 mixtures was more severe, irregular and long-lasting. Except for the Na2SO4-NaCl mixture, Fe3Al corroded more than FeAl. The scales consisted always of an outer layer rich in iron oxide and an inner layer containing mostly Al but also Fe and S whose actual composition differed for the two salt mixtures. The corrosion mechanism involved to a different extent mixed oxidation-sulfidation and scale fluxing.

AB The Ni-based superalloy, Inconel 738LC, was corroded between 800 and 1000 degrees C for up to 100 h in the Ar/0.2%SO2 gas. The formed scales were susceptible to breakage and spallation, due partly to the incorporation of sulfur. They consisted primarily of Cr2O3, along with some TiO2 and NiO. Preferential oxidation of Cr to Cr2O3 led to the Cr depletion in the Al2O3-rich internal oxidation zone, where Ni, Co, W, and Ta tended to accumulate as corrosion progressed.

TI Effect of W Content on Oxidation Resistance of Experimental Third
   Generation Single Crystal Superalloys
SO RARE METAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING
AB The isothermal oxidation behaviors of three kinds of experimental third generation single crystal superalloys with different tungsten contents were investigated at 1100 degrees C in air by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning election microscopy (SEM) and energy disperse X-ray analysis (EDS). The results show that three kinds of alloys approximately obey subparabolic rate law during oxidation at 1100 degrees C for 100 h. The mass gain of 8 wt% W-containing alloy is higher than that of 6 wt% and 7 wt% W-containing alloys. The oxide scale exposed at 1100 degrees C consists of three layers: an outer Ni(Co)O layer, an intermediate layer mainly composed of oxides and spinels, and an inner Al2O3 layer. The gamma'-free layer is formed in the base alloy. In the current alloy system, the transition of oxidation mechanism happens with increasing W content at 1100 degrees C; therefore, it is found that the alloys with W content less than 7% exhibit relative balance between oxidation resistance and solution strength.

AB In this study zirconium incorporated Cr3C2-(NiCr) coating has been sprayed on three superalloys viz. Superni 718, Superni 600 and Superco 605 using D-gun technique. A comparative study has been carried out to check the cyclic oxidation in air and hot corrosion in simulated incinerator environment (40%Na2SO4-40%K2SO4-10% NaCl-10%KCl) for the coated specimens at 900 degrees C for 100 cycles. Oxidation kinetics has been established for all the specimens using weight change measurements. Corrosion products have been characterized using X-ray diffractometer (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive analysis (SEM/EDAX). Cr3C2-(NiCr) + 0.2%wtZr coating provides very good corrosion resistance in air oxidation for all the three coated superalloys. As all the three coated superalloys shows parabolic behaviour with parabolic rate constant as 0.07 x 10(-10) (g(2) cm(-4) s(-1)) for Superni 718, 0.43 x 10(-10) (g(2) cm(-4) s(-1)) for Superni 600 and 0.3 x 10(-10) (g(2) cm(-4) s(-1)) for Superco 605 This coating is also effective in the molten salt environment but coating on Co-based superalloy Superco 605 did not perform satisfactorily. The parabolic rate constants for coated Superni 718 is 0.61 x 10-10 (g(2) cm(-4) s(-1)), for coated Superni 600 is 6.72 x 10(-1) (g(2) cm(-4) s(-1)) and for coated Superco 605 is 17.5 x 10(-10) (g(2) cm(-4) s(-1)).

AB Diffusion behaviors of Rh, Ta, W, Re, Os, and Ir in ternary gamma'-Ni3Al alloys were investigated at 1373-1473 K using solid-solid single-phase diffusion couples together with the recently developed HitDIC software. The temperature-and concentration-dependent ternary interdiffusivities in Ni3Al-X (X - Rh, Ta, W, Re, Os, and 1r) were determined from the experimental concentration profiles, and also fully validated. After that, a thorough comparison among the interdiffusivities in gamma' Ni-22.9 at% Al-0.1 at% X (X = Ti, V, Cr, Fe, Co, Ni, Nb, Mo, Ru, Rh, Ta, W, Re, Os, Ir and Pt) alloys at 1373-1473 K was then conducted, from which it can be concluded that W exhibits the lowest interdiffusivities in gamma'-Ni3Al alloy, followed by Ta. It is finally suggested that addition of W and Ta in gamma' phase can retard the coarsening of gamma' phase and stabilize the microstructure of the nickel-based single crystal superalloys in terms of the diffusion coefficient.

TI Optimization of Parameters Using Conductive Powder in Dielectric for EDM
   of Super Co 605 with Multiple Quality Characteristics
SO MATERIALS AND MANUFACTURING PROCESSES
AB Experiments were performed using conductive powder-mixed dielectric in electrical discharge machining of Super Co 605 and optimization is carried out by means of Taguchi method. The process input parameters selected are flushing pressure, discharge voltage, pulse on-time, polarity, peak current, and pulse off-time to study the performance characteristics in the form of surface roughness, tool wear, and material removal rate. Experiments based on appropriate orthogonal array are conducted and significant parameters are identified. The optimum process conditions simultaneously leading to a better surface roughness, lower tool wear, and higher material removal rate are then demonstrated by confirmation testing. The experimental results confirm an improvement in surface roughness, tool wear, and material removal rate when Taguchi method is used.

   Al-Co-Cr-Cu-Fe-Ni-Ti -Based High Entropy Alloys
SO JORDAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Widely investigated AlCoCrCuFeNi high entropy alloy has been chosen for optimization of the microstructural and mechanical properties. Different paths have been chosen for optimization; namely the decrease of segregating element Cu, the increase of oxidation protective elements Al and Cr and the approach towards gamma-gamma' microstructure as in Ni-based superalloys. Microscopical observation has been made for each optimization step and compared with results obtained by Vickers microhardness measurements. Out of five derivate alloys: AlCoCrFeNi, Al23Co15Cr23Cu8Fe15Ni16, Al8Co17Cr17Cu8Fe17Ni33, Al8Co17Cr14Cu8Fe17Ni33Mo1Ti1W1 and Al10Co25Cr8Fe15Ni36Ti6, the most promising one has been chosen for further investigation.

TI Stability of ordered L1(2) and B-2 precipitates in face centered cubic
   based high entropy alloys - Al0.3CoFeCrNi and Al0.3CuFeCrNi2
SO SCRIPTA MATERIALIA
AB Adding a small amount of Al to the well-known high entropy alloy (HEA), Al0.1CoCrFeNi, to form Al0.3CoCrFeNi, leads to the precipitation of highly refined ordered L1(2) precipitates, which are stable at 550 C. However, the L12 precipitates (stoichiometry of (Ni,Cr)(3)(Al,Fe,Co)) are de-stabilized and replaced by coarser B2 precipitates on annealing at 700 C. Contrastingly, in the Co-free, Al0.3CuCrFeNi2 high entropy alloy, the L1(2) precipitates are stable at both 550 degrees C (similar to 5 nm) and 700 degrees C (similar to 50 nm), and exhibit a stoichiometry of (NLCu)(3)(ALFe,Cr). These results lead to interesting insights into the stability of ordered phases in HEAs as a function of composition and temperature. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Lattice stability and the effect of Co and Re on the ideal strength of
   Ni: First-principles study of uniaxial tensile deformation
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB Using first-principles density functional calculations, lattice stability of gamma - Ni under [001], [110], and [111] uniaxial tensions and the effect of alloying elements Co and Re on the uniaxial tensile behavior of gamma - Ni were studied in this paper. With elastic constants and phonon spectra calculations, we examined the mechanical stability and phonon stability of Ni during the uniaxial tensions along the three characteristic directions. The results show that the mechanical stability and phonon stability of a lattice occurs before the maximum stress-strain point under the [001] and [111] tension, respectively. The effects of Co and Re on the ideal tensile strength of gamma - Ni show a significant directivity: Co and Re have little effect on the stresses in [001] and [111] directions, but increases the ideal strength of the system in the weakest uniaxial tensile direction. Moreover, the strengthening effect of Re is significantly better than that of Co. By further analyzing electronic structure, it is found that the effect of alloying elements on the uniaxial tensile behavior of g -Ni comes from their interactions with host atoms.

AB The tensile creep behavior of a Co-Al-W-base single crystal alloy containing Ta and Ti was investigated at 982 degrees C and 248 MPa. The lattice misfit of experimental alloy was measured to be positive by synchrotron X-ray diffraction at high temperature, and long term heat treatment at 1000 degrees C for 1000 h revealed a gamma' volume fraction of 75% without secondary phases. The creep test indicated that the creep properties of experimental alloy exceeded commercial 1st generation Ni-base single crystal superalloy CMSX-3 with respect to the rupture life. The initial cuboidal gamma' precipitates directionally coarsened parallel to the applied stress axis during the creep process. The stacking faults in {111} planes within gamma' rafts were the primary creep deformation mode by TEM investigation.

TI Site preference and alloying effect of tungsten in the mu phase of
   Co7Mo6
SO PHILOSOPHICAL MAGAZINE LETTERS
AB The electronic structures of the phase of Co7Mo6 were investigated by means of first-principles calculation based on the density functional theory. The calculated equilibrium lattice parameters of Co7Mo6 are in good agreement with the experimental results. The results of calculation reveal that the addition of tungsten (W) promotes the stability of the phase of Co7Mo6 and W tends to participate in its formation. Through analysing the calculated electronic structure (partial density of states and charge density difference), it can be noted that a strong interaction exists due to d-d hybridization. Also, the majority of the atoms may contribute their valence electrons to the formation of metallic bonds in binary and ternary systems. Furthermore, the calculated results show that the doped W atom prefers to occupy the Co site in Co7Mo6 phase.

TI A first-principles study of the effect of Ta on the superlattice
   intrinsic stacking fault energy of L1(2)-Co-3(Al,W)
SO INTERMETALLICS
AB New Co-based alloys containing a L1(2) reinforcement phase display exceptional high-temperature properties. Early research has shown that the quaternary alloy Co-8.8Al-9.8W-2Ta (at.%) has a high-temperature strength comparable to single-crystal Ni-based superalloys above 1200 K. Associated With high strength is an unusual high density of intrinsic stacking faults within the gamma' precipitates. In this work, Density Functional Theory, the Axial Next Nearest Neighbor Ising model and Special Quasi-random Structures have been used to calculate the stacking fault energy of L1(2)-Co-3(ALW) and the effect of small Ta additions on the stacking fault energy. The model predicts a superlattice intrinsic stacking fault energy of 90-93 mJ/m(2), which increases up to 30% when one Ta atom is substituted on the AIM/ sub-lattice. This effect can be explained by considering d-band effects resulting from the addition of Ta. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Effect of Microstructure Evolution on Micro/Nano-Mechanical Property of
   Fe-Co-Ni Ternary Alloys Solidified under Microgravity Condition
SO STEEL RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL
AB Rapid solidification of highly undercooled Fe-Co-Ni alloys is realized by drop tube technique. The microstructures of Fe-10%Co-10%Ni, Fe-15.6%Co-12%Ni, and Fe-10%Co-20%Ni alloys are all composed of single alpha(Fe) solid solution phase, which are confirmed by the results of XRD and DSC. With the decrease of droplet diameters, the cooling rate and undercooling increase, meanwhile, the microstructural characteristic of alpha(Fe) phase transforms from coarse dendrites to equiaxed grains. The size of coarse dendrites decreases to one tenth for the refined equiaxed grains. Employing the Vickers hardness and nano indenter techniques, the mechanical properties of alpha(Fe) dendrites are investigated. The average Vickers microhardness of alpha(Fe) phase is remarkably enhanced with the decrease of the grain size. Due to the more homogenous solute distribution in the dendrite trunks, the nanohardness presents a gentle fluctuation. Once the droplet diameter exceeds a critical value, the solutes concentrate at the grain boundaries. As a result, the closer the indenters to the grain boundary, the larger the nanohardness.

TI Microstructural stability and tensile properties of a Ti-containing

SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB Microstructural stability and tensile properties of a Ti-containing single-crystal Co-Ni-Al-W-alloy with low tungsten content have been investigated. The alloy possesses relatively lower density and higher gamma' solvus temperature compared to some high-tungsten-content Co-Al-W-base alloys. After aging at 900-1000 degrees C for 400 h, the alloy maintains the stable gamma/gamma' two-phase microstructure without the presence of secondary phases. In the low and medium temperature range (R.T.-800 degrees C), the alloy exhibits superior tensile strength compared to the reported single-crystal Co-Al-W-base alloys, while above 800 degrees C, the yield stress decreases rapidly with temperature increasing. The major deformation mechanisms of the alloy consist of shearing of the gamma' precipitates by pairs of a/2 < 110 >-type dislocations from room temperature to 800 degrees C and bypassing of the gamma' precipitates by a/2 < 110 >-type matrix dislocations above 900 degrees C. At 900 degrees C, it shows a transition from the gamma' shearing to bypassing. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI MCrAlY coating design based on oxidation-diffusion modelling. Part I:
   Microstructural evolution
SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB To improve the efficiency of modern gas turbines, it is highly desired to develop durable MCrAlY alloys, to be used as protective coatings against oxidation and corrosion for superalloys which are the base materials for some hot components like turbine blades and vanes. In this paper, an oxidation-diffusion model was used to simulate the diffusion of alloying elements and the corresponding microstructural changes in different superalloy-coating systems at high temperature. Two important processes are considered in this model: oxidation of the coating and interdiffusion between the superalloy and the coating. The model showed an accurate predictability of the diffusion and microstructural evolution in real superalloy-coating diffusion couples studied at high-temperature exposure. The model was further applied to investigate the elemental effects of Ni, Co, Cr and Al on the microstructural evolution, considering the development of two important phases in superalloys and coatings, i.e. FCC-gamma' and BCC-beta, at different temperatures. The results in this paper deepen the knowledge of the MCrAlY coating design for superalloy-coating systems in high-temperature applications. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The influence of microstructure stability on the creep properties of single crystal nickel-based superalloys was investigated by means of the measurement of the creep curves and microstructure observation. Results show that the superalloy with 4%(mass fraction)W in Ni-Al-Cr-Ta-Co-5.5%Mo-x%W systems displays a better microstructure stability, but the P phase is precipitated in the superalloy with 6% W during aging. The strip-like mu phase is precipitated to be parallel or perpendicular to each other along the < 110 > orientation, and grown into the slice-like morphology along the {111} planes. The superalloy with 4%W displays a better creep rupture lifetime under the applied stress of 200 MPa at 982 degrees C, but the creep lifetime of alloy is obviously decreased with the increase of the element W content up to 6%. The fact that the mu phase is precipitated in the superalloy with 6% W during applied stress and unstress aging results in the appearance of the poor regions for the refractory elements. This is one of the main reasons for reducing the creep rupture lifetime of the superalloy.

SO RARE METAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING
AB The microstructure evolution and coarsening behaviors of disordered gamma phase in the inverse Co-19.7Ti alloy have been investigated by experiments and a phase-field method. Both the experimental and simulated results show that the morphologies of gamma phase evolve from near-spherical shape to plate-like shape as the aging time increases. The coarsening kinetics for the mean particle size obeys the cube law r(3) = kt, and it can be obtained as: (r) over bar (3)(t) = 1.126 x 10(19) t exp[-349890/RT]. There exist two distinct stages of the mean particle size increase versus aging time, the growth rate is dramatically larger in the stage 1 and has a relatively slower increase in the stage II. The summit of precipitate size distributions becomes larger and the breadth of the distributions decreases from 700 degrees C to 750 degrees C. The simulated results reproduce well the experimental results.

AB We proposed a new method for developing Ni-base turbine disc alloy for application at temperatures above 700 degrees C by mixing a Ni-base superalloy U720LI with a two-phase alloy Co-16.9 wt pet Ti in various contents. The microstructure and phase stability of the alloys were analyzed using an optical microscope, a scanning electron microscope, energy-dispersive spectroscopy, and an X-ray diffractometer. The yield strength was studied by compression tests at temperatures ranging from 25 degrees C to 1200 degrees C. The results show that all the alloys had a dendritic structure. Ni3Ti (eta) phase was formed in the interdendritic region in the alloys with the addition of Co-16.9 wt pet Ti, and its volume fraction increased with the increase in the addition of Co-16.9 wt pet Ti. The results of exposure at 750 degrees C show that the addition of Co-16.9 wt pet Ti to U720LI had a great effect on suppressing the formation of a phase due to the reduced Cr content in the gamma matrix. Compared to U720LI, the alloys with the addition of Co-16.9 wt pet Ti possessed higher yield strength. The solid-solution strengthening of gamma and gamma' and higher volume fraction of gamma' were assumed to cause this strength increase.

AB The molar volume of nickel and the partial molar volumes of Cr, Co, W, Ta, Al, Mo, and Re are computed from the densities of liquid nickel and liquid Ni-based binary alloys measured by the modified sessile drop method (MSDM) and the modified pycnometric method (MPM). The molar volumes of Hf, Nb, and Ti are calculated from the literature density values of these elements. A prediction model for the densities of liquid Ni-based alloys is developed based on the obtained molar/partial molar volumes of the elements in liquid Ni-based alloys. The validity of this model is verified by the density data of liquid Ni-based ternary (Ni-Co-Al), quaternary (Ni-Co-Al-Cr, Ni-Co-Al-Mo, and Ni-Cr-Al-Mo), and commercial alloys measured by both MSDM and MPM. It is also verified by the density values of liquid Ni-based commercial alloys in the literature. It has been shown that the present model can provide reasonable estimation for the density and its temperature dependency of liquid Ni-based alloys. The difference between the predicted value and the measured/cited value is within +/- 2.5 pct.

SO MATERIALS RESEARCH EXPRESS
AB Surfacing gradient layers using different materials on the surface of die is an efficient way to improve its service life, especially under extreme high temperature and high pressure. To obtain superior high-temperature stability, a cobalt-based superalloy welding material, JLCo32 and a nickel-based superalloy welding material, CHN327 were both designed in this study as surface layers which welded on the die manufactured by bimetal-layer surfacing technology. Arc surfacing of the two kinds of superalloy was conducted on ferrous alloys matrix, and ten cycles of heating to 700 degrees C with a speed of 2 degrees C s(-1) followed by water quenching were operated to simulate the temperature cycles of dies in service. Changes of the microstructures before and after cycles of heating and water quenching were characterized by means of optical microscopy (OM), x-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results indicated that, after ten cycles of heating and water quenching, the major precipitates of JLCo32 were carbides and there were more gamma '' phases in CHN327. The mechanical properties of the surfacing layer were investigated by microhardness tests and shear tests. High-temperature tensile tests at different temperatures were performed to examine the high-temperature behaviour of these two kinds of superalloy. Experimental results showed that, compared with CHN327, JLCo32 exhibits higher microhardness and more reliable bonding with ferrous alloy matrix. For the two superalloys, microhardness near the welding line tend to increase after cycles of heating and water quenching attributed to the diffusion of strengthening elements. Furthermore, in comparison to CHN327, JLCo32 own superior yield strength and ultimate tensile strength but inferior ductility.

SO JOURNAL OF THE JAPAN INSTITUTE OF METALS
AB The phase-field method has recently been extended and utilized across many fields in materials science. Since this method can systematically incorporate the effect of coherent strain induced by lattice mismatch and applied stress as well as external electric and magnetic fields, it has been applied to many material processes including solidification, solid-state phase transformations and various types of complex microstructure changes.
   In this paper, firstly the calculation method of phase-field approach is briefly explained. In particular, the basic philosophy of phase-field simulation is mentioned. Secondly, we summarize the recent calculation results of the phase-field simulation of phase transformations in Fe-based alloys and Ni (or Co)-based superalloys. Finally, the image-based calculation of materials properties is explained, where the simulated microstructure image that is the output data of phase-field simulation is employed as a boundary condition for calculating the materials property, and we show the cases of the mechanical property (stress-strain curve), magnetic property (ferromagnetic hysteresis) and electric property (ferroelectric hysteresis) as typical examples of this approach.

AB Hot corrosion or molten salt corrosion is a form of corrosion which consumes materials to high corrosion rates, because it destroys the protective oxide layer formed on the metal surface. Therefore, it has been developed more resistant materials such as superalloys which have been manufactured for high temperature applications. A study of the corrosion performance of Ni-based alloys (Inconel 600, 601, 617 and 625) in NaVO3 molten salt at 700 degrees C was realized. In order to determine the corrosion resistance of the alloys, electrochemical techniques and weight loss tests were used. Electrochemical techniques applied were polarization potentiodynamic curves, open circuit potential and the linear polarization resistance. Analyses were conducted by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction to analyze the products of corrosion. It was observed that Inconel 600 and 601 showed the best corrosion resistance, however the Inconel 617 and 625 showed a low performance. It is known that Cr is responsible for the corrosion resistance; this due to the formation of the protective layer of Cr2O3, however, the Ni content plays an important role in the performance of this type of materials, as well as the other alloying elements (Al, Ti, Nd, Co and Mo).

AB The present study focuses on the microstructural evolution in Co-Re-Cr-Ni alloys at high temperatures. Four alloys with different Cr and Ni contents were studied. The microstructural examinations were performed using complementary methods of scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry and neutron diffraction. Based on the experimental results and assisted by thermodynamic calculations, the effect of Cr and Ni on the microstructure could be identified. While both Ni and Cr, but Cr only if Ni is also present in the alloy, stabilize the fcc phase, the impacts of these elements on the sigma phase formation are different. It was found that the temperature stability of the sigma phase enhances with increasing Cr content, whereas Ni reduces the required Cr concentration for the sigma phase formation. The evaluation of the Cr and Ni effects on the microstructural evolution contributes to a fundamental understanding of the alloy behaviour and, thus, is a key aspect for successful alloy development.

TI Creep mechanisms of a new Ni-Co-base disc superalloy at an intermediate
   temperature
SO JOURNAL OF MICROSCOPY
AB The microstructures of a new Ni-Co-base disc superalloy, TMW-4M3, before and after the creep test at 725 degrees C/630 MPa have been systematically investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The crept microstructures were marked as three different deformation stages (I, II and III) corresponding to the gradually increased strain. At stage I, stacking fault (SF) shearing was the main deformation mechanism. The SF was extrinsic and lay on {111} plane. However, deformation microtwinning became the dominant mode at stage II and III. The average spacing of deformation twins decreased from 109 +/- 15 nm at stage II to 76 +/- 12 nm at stage III, whereas the twin thickness did not change significantly. The influence of stacking fault energy (SFE) of ? matrix on the deformation mechanism is discussed. It is suggested that lower SFE in TMW-4M3 is partly responsible for the enhanced creep resistance.

TI Influence of Re/Ru on concentration distribution in the gamma/gamma '
   phases of nickel-based single crystal superalloys
SO MATERIALS & DESIGN
AB In order to understand the influence of Ru and Re on the concentration distributions of elements in gamma' and gamma phases, the partitioning behaviors of elements in various alloy are investigated by means of atom probe tomography (APT). Results showthat the elements Al, Ta and Ni are enriched in gamma' phase, while the elements Co, Cr, Mo, W, Re and Ru are enriched in. matrix phase. Adding Ru may decrease the partitioning ratio of elements in gamma and gamma' phases. Wherein, when Ru atoms dissolve into gamma' phase to substitute the Al atoms, some Re, Mo andWatoms adhered in the round of Ru atoms, under the hybridization effect of d orbit, may dissolve into.' phase, which is thought to be the main reason of Ru decreasing the partitioning ratios of gamma' and gamma phases. When adding Re into the alloy, the Re atomswith lowdiffusion coefficientmay hinder the diffusion of other atoms away from gamma' phase during the growth of.' phase, which is thought to be themain reason of decreasing the partitioning ratios of elements in gamma and gamma' phase.

TI An investigation of diffusion-mediated cyclic coarsening and reversal
   coarsening in an advanced Ni-based superalloy
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB The anomalous cyclic coarsening behaviour of gamma' precipitates after ageing at 1073 K has been investigated for the low misfit commercial powder metallurgy (PM) Ni-based superalloy RR1000. Using scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) imaging combined with absorption-corrected energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy, the elemental segregation as a function of coarsening behaviour has been experimentally observed for secondary gamma' precipitates. Elemental EDX spectrum imaging has revealed nanoscale enrichment of Co and Cr and a depletion of Al and Ti within the gamma matrix close to the gamma-gamma' interface. Our experimental results, coupled with complementary modelling and synchrotron X-ray diffraction analysis, demonstrate the importance of elastic strain energy resulting from local compositional variations for influencing precipitate morphology. In particular, elemental inhomogeneities, as a result of complex diffusive interactions within both matrix and precipitates, play a crucial role in determining the rate of coarsening. Our findings provide important new evidence for understanding the microstructural evolution observed for advanced superalloys when they are exposed to different heat treatment regimes.

SO JOURNAL OF IRON AND STEEL RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL
AB The precipitation behavior of topological close-packed (TCP) mu phase in powder metallurgy (P/M) nickel-based superalloy FGH97 was investigated. The results showed that proper addition of solution strengthening elements, such as Co, Cr, W, Mo, improved tensile strength, while excessive addition of those elements facilitated the precipitation of mu phase, which seriously aggravated the plasticity of the P/M superalloy. For the heat-treated specimens, the relationship between critical aging time (when mu started to precipitate) aging temperature, and the average electron vacancy number of gamma matrix was established.

TI Protective coatings for aeronautic and power generation turbines
   components deposited by plasma spray
SO BOLETIN DE LA SOCIEDAD ESPANOLA DE CERAMICA Y VIDRIO
AB Coatings produced by aluminium diffusion, called aluminide are employed to increase the oxidation and corrosion resistance, increasing the life of Ni and Co base superalloys components at temperatures comprised between 900 and 1050 degrees C. Consequently these coatings are frequently employed in aeronautic and Fewer generation turbines as well as in the chemical industry. Aluminides are industrially produced by pack cementation or CVD and recently it has been demonstrated that its resistance significantly increases when Cr is added (chrome-aluminides). During this work, a feasibility study has been carried out in order to determine if plasma spray can be employed for depositing this type of coatings on turbine blades. Therefore, aluminium and aluminium/chromium layers were deposited on Ni base IN100 superalloy specimens that were subsequently subjected to a diffusion heat treatment under Ar flow Characterisation and analysis of the coatings were carried out by metallography, SEM and EDS. Cyclic oxidation tests were carried out at 1050 degrees C while molten sulphate hot corrosion was performed at 900 degrees C. The results of this preliminary study are promising and indicate that plasma spray can be developed as an industrial process for production of aluminide and chrome-aluminide coatings.

TI COMPOSITION OF SURFACE-FILMS ON NICKEL-BASE SUPERALLOYS
SO JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB The composition and thickness of the passive film formed on three nickel base superalloys (Inconel 718, Incoloy 925, and MP35N) in an acetate buffer (1 mol 1-1 acetic acid/1 mol 1-1 sodium acetate) was investigated using the technique of surface analysis by laser ionization (SALI).  The thickness of the films was found to be similar for the three alloys and was estimated to be 1.5 +/- 0.5 nm.  The films were all enriched in Cr but were depleted in Ni and Fe (where relevant).  Mo enrichment occurs with the Inconel, but only slightly with the Incoloy and MP35N.  The degree of Mo segregation appears to be related to the Ni content of the alloy.  The film is basically a Ni-Cr-Fe oxide on Inconel 718, a Ni-Cr-Fe-Cu oxide on Incoloy 925, and a Ni-Cr-Co oxide on MP35N.  The high Cr content of the oxides accounts in large part for the high corrosion resistance of these alloys.  MP35N further benefits from a relatively high level of Mo in the film.  The smaller amounts of Mo in the oxides on the Inconel and Incoloy are compensated to some extent by enriched levels of Nb and Cu, respectively.

TI DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW NI-BASE SUPERALLOY FOR INDUSTRIAL GAS-TURBINE
   COMBUSTOR BY STATISTICAL ALLOY DESIGN METHOD
SO TETSU TO HAGANE-JOURNAL OF THE IRON AND STEEL INSTITUTE OF JAPAN
AB A new Ni-base superalloy has been developed for gas turbine combustor.  In the first stage, multiple regression analysis was conducted on the published material data of superalloys.  The eatimation equations were established to estimate the mechanical properties such as stress rupture strength and tensile properties, and physical properties such as density and thermal conductivity.  Alloy design program by statistical method was made to select the alloy chemical compositions which will satisfy the requirements of structural design.  By means of this alloy design method, 22%Cr-8%Co-9%Mo-3%W-1%Al-0.3%Ti-Ni base alloy (%:mass%) was set up for combustor superalloy.  The superalloy plates using these alloy elements were manufactured by vacuum induction and remelting process weighing 2000 kg.
   The mechanical and physical properties were examined on those plates, and it is confirmed that these estimated values by alloy design coincide with the testing measured values.  As above test results, it is considered that the statistical alloy design is useful for developing new superalloys.  The new Ni-base superalloy also has good workability, good mechanical and physical properties for industrial gas turbine combustor.

AB The corrosion behavior of pure metals that form the basis of high-temperature superalloys has been investigated in an Ar-42.6%O-2-14.7%Br-2 gas mixture at 700 degrees C. which was one of the environments encountered in the University of Tokyo (UT)-3 thermochemical water decomposition reaction process to produce hydrogen. The test metals were nickel, chromium, cobalt. copper. iron, titanium, hafnium, zirconium, molybdenum. niobium. tantalum, and tungsten. Thermodynamic phase stability diagrams were constructed for nickel, chromium, iron. cobalt. titanium, tungsten, and zirconium to predict the stable. condensed corrosion products, and the oxides were predicted to be thermodynamically stable phases. Postreaction characterization of the test metals included discontinuous mass-change measurements. scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive x-ray analysis, and x-ray diffraction. Xray diffraction identified oxides as corrosion products for all metals. But low-melting metal bromides Were also detected for titanium. tungsten. molybdenum, copper, and iron; these caused rapid consumption of the metals. Although scanning electron microscopy revealed chromium oxide (Cr2O3) scale formation on chromium, energy-dispersive x-ray analysis identified bromine-containing species at the cracked scale/metal interface.

TI Surface chemistry evolution of F-doped Ni-base superalloy upon heat
   treatment
SO MATERIALS AND CORROSION-WERKSTOFFE UND KORROSION
AB Ni-based superalloys with Al-contents between 3 and 5wt% exhibit insufficient oxidation resistance at temperatures above 900 degrees C. A change of the oxidation mechanism has been achieved after doping surface-near regions with fluorine by ion implantation and subsequent heat treatment. With that, the formation of a protective alumina scale was observed. This study is dedicated to the nature of the kinetic bias for the alumina scale formation. The samples of alloy IN738 (3.5wt% Al) were implanted with F-ions (10(17)F/cm(2) at 38keV). The depth profiles of O, Ni, Cr, Co, Ti, and Al were determined using secondary neutrals mass spectrometry (SNMS), whereas the F-depth profiles were measured by non-destructive proton-induced gamma-ray emission (PIGE). Directly after F-implantation no Al-enrichment near the surface was observed. After heating up to temperatures between 400 and 800 degrees C, no distinct alumina scale formation was observed. At 1000 and 1050 degrees C, a distinct Al-rich region has formed. Extending the oxidation time up to 12h leads to a pronounced Al-profile, suggesting the growth of a pure alumina scale near the surface.

   coatings deposited by chemical vapor deposition
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Aluminization has been employed on superalloys to form dense and adhesive alumina surface layers to prolong their service life at high temperature. A chemical vapor deposited aluminizing process had been employed to deposit nickel aluminide coatings on the nickel-based single-crystal superalloys. The kinetics behavior, phase evaluation, microstructure and chemical composition of the aluminide coatings after oxidation and hot corrosion tests were studied in detail. After isothermal oxidation test, a dense and protective alpha-Al2O3 surface layer is formed on the aluminized superalloy and phase transformation reactions occur in the aluminide layer and interdiffusion zone. The inward diffusion of Al element toward the substrate and formation of micro-pores in the interdiffusion zone are probably the main degradation modes of the aluminide coating. Corrosive medium including of mixed of aviation fuels and artificial seawater has not serious deterioration of aluminide coating after hot corrosion at 1123 K, although large of micro-pores and few of microcracks are observed within the aluminide layer, and the typical morphology of the aluminide layer becomes corse and disorder to a certain extent.

TI Influence of welding on low cycle fatigue properties of Co-based
   superalloy FSX-414
SO TRANSACTIONS OF NONFERROUS METALS SOCIETY OF CHINA
AB Co-based superalloys such as FSX-414 have been recently used in gas turbine first stage nozzles. During service, nozzles are exposed to low cycle fatigue, which can lead to cracking of these components. The cracks on these nozzles are usually welded with tungsten arc welding (TIG) using Co-based filler metals. In this paper, the effect of TIG on the tensile and low cycle fatigue properties of Co-based superalloy FSX-414 was studied at 950 degrees C. The experimental results show that the yield and ultimate tensile stresses of welded and unwelded specimens are comparable to each other. But toughness of welded specimens is lower than that of unwelded ones. The low cycle fatigue properties of FSX-414 were studied at a strain rate of 3.3x10(-4) s(-1), strain ratio R=-1 (R=epsilon(min)/epsilon(max)) and Delta epsilon(t) (total strain change) from 0.8% to 2%. In welded specimens, at high strain cycling, the nucleation and growth of cracks occur in the welded zone. But at Delta epsilon(t)=0.8%, fracture occurs in the same zones of unwelded specimens. The results show that the total fatigue lives of the welded specimens are shorter than those of unwelded ones. In all of the low cycle fatigue tests, softening phenomena are observed.

SO MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS
AB The additive manufacturing (AM) process, which can produce highly complex components, has been getting significant attention in both industry and academic research. Ti-based alloys, Ni-based superalloys, and Co-Cr-based alloys have been widely investigated. However, as Ni-based superalloys have precipitated phases such as the gamma' and gamma '' phases, and Ti-based alloys and Co-Cr-based alloys are multiphase alloys which have phase transformation, it is difficult to clarify the factors in the AM process that in fluence the strength of these alloys. In this study, SUS316L stainless steel, which is a single-phase solid-solution alloy and does not have precipitated phases, was used to investigate the effect of specific factors in the AM process on anisotropy or mechanical properties, and the strengthening mechanism in the AM process in comparison with SUS316L plastic-forming (PF) material. The AM SUS316L was fabricated by selective laser melting using an ytterbium fiber laser from fine metallic powder. We found that the coarse columnar grains grew up along the built direction and the dislocation cell structures which were induced during the AM process into the AM material. During the solution heat treatment, dislocation recovery was observed. The AM specimens showed higher tensile and creep strength compared with the conventional material (the PF material) because of the high dislocation density. The ductility of the AM specimens was lower than that of the conventional material because of defects caused by a lack of fusion at the molten pool boundaries. Furthermore, the specimens whose loading direction corresponds to the built direction showed lower strength and elongation than the specimens whose loading direction was perpendicular to the built direction due to the oriented defects.

Mo and Co were found to adversely affect both the cyclic oxidation performance and TBC compatibility. None of the four factorials were found to have a statistically significant impact on LCF. In general, the largest creep temperature benefits over CMSX-4 were observed at low (< 800 degrees C) and high (> 1000 degrees C) temperatures. At intermediate temperatures (-850 degrees C to 950 degrees C) the improvement in temperature capability was less pronounced. Mo was found to have the only statistically significant contribution on creep. Consistent with the correlation between lattice misfit and creep, the impact was positive at low temperatures/high stresses and negative at intermediate conditions. As misfit increases in low temperature creep the density of dislocations in the gamma' decreases and the number of stacking faults in the gamma channels increases. The latter culminates in a negative misfit threshold above which primary creep is effectively 'turned off. Under intermediate creep conditions, high negative misfit alloys spontaneously develop a 'labyrinth' structure that comprises approximately equal numbers of rafts in all three < 001 > directions irrespective of the direction of the applied stress. This tendency for labyrinth rafting imposes an upper limit on the magnitude of the negative misfit and thus the degree to which the gamma-matrix can be usefully strengthened with refractory elements at intermediate temperatures.

TI TCP phase predictions in Ni-based superalloys: Structure maps revisited
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB The traditional methods for predicting the occurrence of deleterious topologically close-packed (TCP) phases in Ni-based superalloys have been based on the PHACOMP and newPHACOMP methodologies. These schemes use the average number of holes (N) over bar (h) or the centre of gravity of the elemental d-bands (M) over bard to predict whether or not a given multicomponent alloy will be prone to TCP formation. However, as both these one-dimensional methodologies are well-known to fail with respect to new generations of alloys, a novel two-dimensional structure map ((N) over bar, (Delta V/V) over bar) is introduced where N is the average electron concentration and (Delta V/V) over bar is a composition-dependent size-factor difference. This map is found to separate the experimental data on the TCP phases of binary A-B transition metal alloys into well-defined but sometimes overlapping regions corresponding to different structure types such as A15, sigma, chi, R, P, delta, mu, M and Laves. Detailed investigations of ternary phase diagrams and multicomponent systems show that TCP phases, regardless of the number of constituents, are located in the same regions of the structure map that are favoured by the binary compounds of the same structure type. The structure map is then used in conjunction with CALPHAD computations of sigma phase stability to show that the predictive power of newPHACOMP for the seven component Ni-Co-Cr-Ta-W-Re-Al system studied recently by Reed et al. [24] is indeed poor. This supports a growing consensus that robust methods of TCP phase prediction in multicomponent alloys will require the inclusion of reliable first-principles thermodynamic databases within the semi-empirical CALPHAD scheme.

TI Improvement of wear resistance of hot working tool steel by hardfacing -
   Part 1 - Effect of microstructure and hardness
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Hardfacing is one of the most useful and economical ways to improve the performance of components subjected to severe wear conditions. The aim of the present work was to investigate the influence of hardfacing on the hardness and wear resistance of a hot working tool steel. Two cobalt based and one nickel based superalloys were used as hardfacing materials. Stellite 6 and 21 were deposited on H11 steel via tungsten inert gas (TIG) and shielded metal arc welding and Inconel 625 was deposited by TIG welding techniques. The pin on disc high temperature wear tests were carried out on hardfaced materials. The worn surfaces were also characterised using SEM and X-ray diffraction methods. The results showed that TIG hardfacings process having a low dilution, owing to the refined solidification structure and high capacity of work hardening enhances better wear resistance.

TI Dendrite Segregation in Ni3Al-Based Intermetallic Single Crystals
   Alloyed with Cr, Mo, W, Ti, Co, and Re
SO RUSSIAN METALLURGY
AB The character of dendrite segregation in Ni3Al-based intermetallic VKNA-type alloy single crystals with a dendritic-cellular structure is studied. Distribution coefficient k(d) of an alloying element (AE) in the alloy during solidification k(d) = c(d.a.I)/c(0) (c(0) is the AE content in the alloy (liquid phase composition), c(d.a.I) is the AE content in primary dendrite arms of the alloy (in the solid phase)) and segregation coefficient k(s) = c(d.a.I)/c(i.d) (c(i.d) is the AE content in the interdendritic space) have been found. A comparative study of the dendrite segregation parameters in VKNA-nype Ni3Al-based intermetallic alloys and the well-known ZhS36type nickel superalloy shows that the intermetallic alloys satisfy to the rule deduced for two- and three-component nickel-based superalloys: if an introduced AE increases the melting temperature of the basic metal, we have k(d) > 1 (Co, W, Re); if it decreases the melting temperature, we have k(d) < 1 (Al, Ti, Cr, Mo). Dendrite segregation coefficients k(s) are dependent on the proportion of the AE contents in the alloys. In nickel superalloys, the dendrite segregation of aluminum, tungsten, and rhenium is higher than that in the intermetallic alloys. The dendrite segregation coefficients of tungsten and rhenium is higher by a factor of 1.5-2 than that in the VKNA-type intermetallic alloys with a low content of refractory metals. This can be due to the retardation of diffusion of refractory metals in the solid phase of a nickel superalloy highly alloyed with these elements.

TI Experimental investigation of Ti-Nb-Co ternary system at 1000 degrees C
SO MATERIALS & DESIGN
AB The phase relations in the Ti-Nb-Co system are of great importance for the design of high temperature Ti alloys. The isothermal section of Ti-Nb-Co system at 1000 degrees C has been established using one diffusion couple supplemented with 13 key alloys. Phase relations and ternary solubility of the binary compounds were determined using electron probe microscopy (EPMA), wave dispersive X-ray spectrometer (WDS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques. There are 19 two-phase equilibria and 9 three-phase equilibria in the isothermal section at 1000 degrees C. The determined maximum solubility of Nb in TiCo3, TiCo2 (h), TiCo2 (c), TiCo, Ti2Co were 6.22, 17.21, 2.29, 22.88 and 2.49 at.%, respectively. Nb2Co7, NbCo3, NbCo2, Nb6Co7 dissolves up about 0.33, 17.75, 13.26 and 10.81 at.% Ti, respectively. All of the binary phases have a certain composition range at 1000 degrees C except Nb2Co7. The phase diagram of Ti-Nb-Co system varied greatly when the temperature raised from 900 degrees C to 950 degrees C, but the changes was not so big when temperature increased from 950 degrees C to 1000 degrees C.

AB Cast NiCrAl alloys with additions of Y, La, Hf and Ti were evaluated at 1100 degrees C in wet (10 and 50% H2O) and dry air (0% H2O) in order to optimize such dopants for superalloy bond coatings. The results suggest that the typical Y addition in most coatings could be replaced by La. Also, scale adhesion in cyclic testing was improved with the co-addition of Hf with La or Y. Ti was added to investigate its incorporation in coatings on superalloys containing significant Ti additions. Particularly with co-doped alloys, the addition of Ti had little effect on scale adhesion but did reduce the depth of internal oxidation. Water vapor increased spallation, especially for the least adherent alloys, such as Y,Ti-doped NiCrAl. For the co-doped compositions with Hf, water vapor had a limited effect on scale adhesion and on the alumina growth rate in isothermal exposures. In addition to specimen mass change, the extent of internal oxidation and the depletion of beta phase in the substrate were evaluated. Analytical transmission electron microscopy showed that Y, La and Hf co-segregated to the alumina scale grain boundaries and formed dopant-rich oxide precipitates in the scale.

TI Microstructure and Mechanical Properties of Co-Al-W-Ta-Nb Alloys at

SO RARE METAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING
AB The microstructural evolution and room/high-temperature mechanical properties were investigated for a Co-9Al-9W-2Ta alloy with 4at%, 6at% and 9at% Nb additions to replace the same content of W (referred as to 4Nb, 6Nb and 9Nb alloy hereafter, 0Nb for the alloy without Nb addition, and the content of W+Nb=9 at% for all alloys) prepared by arc-melting. Results show that the as-cast alloys exhibit a microstructure composed of Co-base solid solution gamma phase (gamma-Co-ss) and eutectic of gamma+ intermetallic compound Co3Nb. While after 1200 degrees C, 8 h solution and 800 degrees C, 100 h aging, the cubic gamma' phase with a size of 200 similar to 300 nm precipitates homogeneously and coherently on the gamma matrix for the 0Nb similar to 6Nb alloys. Besides, cellular and/or needle-like Co3Nb phases are found in the 4Nb similar to 9Nb alloy. The 6Nb alloy shows the highest yield strength in the temperature range of 600 similar to 700 degrees C, while the 4Nb alloy has the highest strength at 800 degrees C. Alloys exhibit yield stress anomalies at temperatures above 600 C, and the temperature corresponding to the anomaly stress peak is about 700 degrees C.

TI Investigation on Conductive Layer, Delamination, and Recast Layer
   Characteristics of Electro-discharge Machined Holes in TBCs
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING AND PERFORMANCE
AB In this study, electrical discharge machining (EDM) is used to directly drill normal effusion cooling holes in thermal-barrier-coated nickel-based superalloys (TBCs) via the assisting electrode method. The formation of the conductive layer was studied using scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive spectroscopy. The effects of the EDM process parameters including peak current, pulse duration, and duty cycle on delamination and recast layer characteristics were investigated. The analysis results indicate that the conductive layer possesses a feature of bilayer structure for the EDM of TBCs. The bottom layer is generated first due to the deposition of carbon-based products and molten brass debris, and its composition primarily contains C, Cu, Zr, and Zn; the surface layer is the result of the overlying of subsequently molten superalloy debris and carbon-based products, and its composition primarily consists of Ni, C, Cr, Nb, Co, Al, Fe, Cu, and Zr. The microcracks of the superalloy substrate only reside in the recast layer during the EDM of TBCs. The thickness of recast layer sharply increases with increasing peak current, pulse duration, and duty cycle, respectively. The delamination occurs at the ceramic coating/bond coating interface for the EDM of drilling normal holes in TBCs, and it can be eliminated by the selection of low discharge energy and appropriate duty cycle. Additionally, the length of delamination increases with increasing peak current, pulse duration, and duty cycle, respectively. The spalling of ceramic coating appears at the entrance of the hole due to the thermal-shock brittle fracture if excessive peak current, pulse duration, or duty cycle is selected.

SO METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND
   MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB A methodology for determining the preferred site occupancy of various alloying elements within ordered gamma' precipitates was developed and applied to Rene88 samples. The method utilized atom probe tomography and X-ray diffraction techniques with controlled monochromated synchrotron beams to determine element positions. Samples were solutionized at 1423 K (1150 degrees C) for 30 minutes and cooled at 24 K/min with subsequent aging at 1033 K (760 degrees C). The synchrotron X-ray diffraction results indicate that niobium prefers to reside on the aluminum sublattice site of the gamma' phase. Additionally, the results indicate that chromium prefers the nickel sublattice sites, while cobalt is likely to occupy both the aluminum and nickel sublattice sites. The X-ray results on the chromium occupancy disagree with atom probe results from the same alloy that indicate that chromium prefers the aluminum sublattice sites.

TI The effects of hard lubricant coatings on the performance of
   electro-plated superabrasive grinding wheels
SO ADVANCES IN ABRASIVE TECHNOLOGY V
SE KEY ENGINEERING MATERIALS
AB Electro-plated superabrasive grinding wheels are gaining popularity in the areas of high-speed machining. They can now be found in the tool banks of multi-axis milling machines, used in the machining of relatively soft, stainless steels and nickel and cobalt based superalloys. These materials not only cause significant wear of the abrasive grain but moreover, tend to clog and load the grinding wheel, rendering it prematurely inoperable. A means of extending the life of an electro-plated wheel is therefore needed when grinding these "gummy" materials. The use of coatings to improve the performance of cutting tools for use in "large chip" machining like turning, milling, drilling and tapping applications has been shown to be successful, and is widely used. Initially, the coatings provided some wear resistance. Later, coatings were developed for thermal insulation and oxidation resistance. Lately, hard lubricant coatings have shown promise, particularly when used in dry and quasi-dry machining applications. The wear resistant coatings of titanium nitride and titanium carbide have been explored with little success in abrasive machining and grinding applications, in industry. The wear resistant coatings used in "large chip" machining never found a place in "small chip" grinding processes. This paper explores the effects of hard lubricant coatings in industry as well as in the laboratory using both force and power measurement for process evaluation. The results show that a significant improvement may be made in electro-plated cBN wheel performance using a hard lubricant coating system, particularly when grinding the soft and low machinability index materials typically used in the medical and aerospace industries.

TI Plastic deformation of polycrystals of Co-3(Al, W) with the L1(2)
   structure
SO PHILOSOPHICAL MAGAZINE
AB The plastic behaviour of Co-3(Al, W) polycrystals with the L1(2) structure has been investigated in compression from 77 to 1273 K. The yield stress exhibits a rapid decrease at low temperatures (up to room temperature) followed by a plateau (up to 950 K), then it increases anomalously with temperature in a narrow temperature range between 950 and 1100 K, followed again by a rapid decrease at high temperatures. Slip is observed to occur exclusively on {111} planes at all temperatures investigated. The rapid decrease in yield stress observed at low temperatures is ascribed to a thermal component of solid-solution hardening that occurs during the motion of APB-coupled dislocations whose core adopts a planar, glissile structure. The anomalous increase in yield stress is consistent with the thermally activated cross-slip of APB-coupled dislocations from (111) to (010), as for many other L1(2) compounds. Similarities and differences in the deformation behaviour and operating mechanisms among Co-3(Al, W) and other L1(2) compounds, such as Ni3Al and Co3Ti, are discussed.

AB In this study, the cyclic corrosion behavior of N06230, N07263, and N06625 in a LiCl-Li2O molten salt was investigated at 650 A degrees C in argon atmosphere. The cyclic corrosion behavior was observed through measurements of the oxide morphology and thickness, the extent of internal corrosion, and compositional changes in the oxide scale and the substrate. The corrosion products in the surface corrosion layers of N07263 were (Ni,Co)O, (Ni,Co)Cr2O4, Cr2O3, and TiO2 and those in the surface corrosion layers of N06230 were NiO, NiCr2O4, and Cr2O3, while NiO, NiCr2O4, CrNbO4, and Cr2O3 were identified as the corrosion products of N06625. The internal corrosion behavior of N07263 was localized, while N06230 and N06625 showed uniform corrosion. N07263 exhibited superior corrosion resistance as its corrosion layer was more continuous, dense, and adherent as compared to those of N06230 and N06625.

TI Modeling of Microstructural Evolution in an MCrAlY Overlay Coating on
   Different Superalloy Substrates
SO METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND
   MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB A multicomponent, one-dimensional diffusion model that was developed for simulating microstructure evolution in coated gas turbine blade systems has been used to compare the phase structures of three MCrAlY coated superalloy systems. The model is based on finite differences and incorporates oxidation and equilibrium thermodynamic computations. The superalloy substrates considered were the nickel-based superalloy CMSX-4, a high-Cr single-crystal superalloy, and a cobalt-based MAR-M509, and these were all coated with an MCrAlY bond coat of similar composition. The results predicted by the model have been compared with similar experimental systems. The model can predict many features observed experimentally and therefore can be expected to be a useful tool in lifetime prediction and microstructural assessment of turbine blade systems based on superalloys. The work also highlighted the fact that for a given coating, the phase evolution within system is dependent on the substrate material.

AB The phase equilibria between the gamma (A1) and liquid phases and those between the gamma, epsilon (A3), sigma (D8(b)) and alpha (A2) phases at temperatures between 750 and 1300 A degrees C in the Co-Cr-Ni system were determined by differential scanning calorimetry and electron probe microanalysis. It was found that the gamma solidus and liquidus temperatures decrease with increasing Cr or Ni content and that the difference between them increases with increasing Cr content. The phase equilibria at 800, 900, 1000, 1100, 1200 and 1300 A degrees C were determined using two- or three-phase alloys, and the phase boundaries due to the magnetically induced phase separation in the gamma and epsilon phases were also observed at 850, 800 and 750 A degrees C by the diffusion couple method.

TI High Modulus Reinforcement Alloys
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON APPLIED SUPERCONDUCTIVITY
AB Materials used as reinforcement for conductors in high-field magnets require both a high capacity for load bearing and a high resistance to deformation under stress; that is, a high value for tensile strength and a high modulus of elasticity. In addition, compatibility between the magnet conductor and any proposed reinforcement materials has to be carefully evaluated in terms of their capability for thermal expansion, stability at high temperature, resistance to oxidation, and crack propagation. We investigated a number of (nickel based and nickel-cobalt based) superalloys designed for high-temperature applications. These superalloys have higher Young's modulus than the stainless steels that are currently used as reinforcement materials for high-field magnets. Our test materials were subjected to thermo-mechanical processing that strengthens the alloys by forming very fine particles within them. Our initial work focused on changes that occured in the alloy during deformation at either cryogenic or room temperature. Because we observed distinct interfaces between the particles and the matrix, we decided that these materials could be described as precipitate-strengthened alloys. Both the strengthening component area and the matrix had more resistance to plastic deformation at cryogenic temperatures, than at room temperatures. In some cases, we further enhanced the strength of the alloy by doping them with other elements. In all the cases, these alloys permitted more efficient performance of conductors by shareing more of the load than would be possible with stainless steel reinforcement materials. This paper outlines the properties of these new alloys and establishes their compatibility with certain conductors commonly used for high-field magnets.

TI Improvement of tensile behaviours of a gamma'-Co3(Al, W) strengthened
   polycrystalline Co-9Al-4.5W-4.5Mo-2Ta-0.02B alloy at room-and

SO PROGRESS IN NATURAL SCIENCE-MATERIALS INTERNATIONAL
AB The microstructures and tensile behaviours of cerium (Ce) doped polycrystalline Co-9Al-4.5W-4.5Mo-2Ta-0.02B alloys (doped 0.05 and 0.2 at.% Ce) at room temperature (RT) and 600-800 degrees C were investigated. In-suit tensile test under SEM was conducted to understand the deformation and damage mechanisms at RT. Aged at 800 degrees C for 50 h, the 0.05Ce alloy consisted of a Co solid-solution matrix (gamma-Co-SS) and nano-scale cuboidal gamma'-Co-3(Al, W) precipitates, while for the 0.2Ce alloy, kappa-Co-3(W, Mo) precipitates and gamma'-depleted zone were present at the grain boundaries in addition to the gamma/gamma' microstructure. The 0.05Ce alloy exhibited flow stress anomalies at 700 degrees C. With higher Sigma 1 similar to 3 boundary fraction and cleaned-up grain boundary, the 0.05Ce alloy always showed greater strength and elongation than the 0.2 Ce alloy with the grain boundary precipitates at temperatures up to 800 degrees C. Doped 0.05 at.% Ce made the Co-9Al-4.5W-4.5Mo-2Ta-0.02B alloy have an excellent elongation of 6.1% at 700 degrees C, owing to a mixed transgranular dimple plus intergranular cleavage fracture. The slip bands transferring through the low-angle grain boundary and slipping of the gamma'-Co-3(Al, W) in the 0.5Ce alloy resulted in excellent ductility of 20.4% at RT.

AB A Co-Ni-based alloy strengthened by gamma'-(L1(2)) precipitates was utilized to investigate the precipitation evolution after various cooling rates and several aging conditions. In this study, the precipitate size and volume fraction have been studied via scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The influence of the precipitation evolution was measured via microhardness tests. The cooling rate study shows a more sluggish gamma' precipitation reaction compared to that observed in a Ni-based superalloy. Following a rapid cooling rate, the application of appropriate double aging treatments allows for the increase of the gamma' volume fraction as well as the control of the size and distribution of the precipitates. The highest hardness values reach those measured on supersolvus cast and wrought Ni-based superalloys. The observed gamma' precipitation behavior should have implications for the production, the heat treatment, the welding, or the additive manufacturing of this new class of high-temperature materials.

TI Effect of alloy composition on the oxidation-induced boron depletion in
   cast Ni-base superalloy components
SO MATERIALS AND CORROSION-WERKSTOFFE UND KORROSION
AB The high temperature air oxidation of the two conventionally cast Ni-based superalloys Rene 80 containing 92wtppm boron and CM 247 containing 110wtppm of boron was studied at temperatures between 850 and 1050 degrees C and times ranging from 1 to 100h. Analysis by GD-OES and SEM/WDX/EBSD revealed the surface scale on Rene 80 after exposure at 1050 degrees C to consist of Cr2O3 with TiO2 in the outer part and BCrO3 and CrTi2O5 in the inner part. Internal Al2O3 precipitates were present below the external scale. After 1h exposure of CM 247 an inner dense alumina scale formed over eutectic alloy regions containing coarse precipitates. Over dendritic regions a Cr-rich oxide scale with BCrO3-precipitates formed initially and aluminum was internally oxidized. After longer oxidation times an alumina sub-scale grew from the internal precipitates, and oxidation of the initially present depleted alloy zones resulted in formation of outer Ni and Co rich oxides. In both alloys, boron depletion in the bulk alloy occurred due to formation of the mentioned boron rich oxide. The extent of depletion was substantially higher for the chromia forming Rene 80 than for CM 247. In the latter material the boron depletion was suppressed after the formation of the dense, inner alumina scale.

AB In The microstructural evolution, room/high-temperature mechanical properties of a Co-9Al-9W-2Ta alloy with 2, 5, 6, 9 at.% Hf additions (referred as to 2Hf, 5Hf, 6Hf and 9Hf alloy hereafter, and content of W+Hf = 9 at.% for all alloys) prepared by arc-melting were investigated. It was found that the as-cast 2Hf similar to 6Hf alloys showed a microstructure composed of Co-base solid solution. phase (gamma-CoSS) and eutectic of gamma+intermetallic compound Co23Hf6, and the 9Hf alloy was composed of primary Co23Hf6 and (gamma+Co23Hf6) eutectic. While after 1170 degrees C/8h solution and 800 degrees C/100h aging, the cubic gamma' phase with a size of 200nm similar to 700nm homogeneously and coherently precipitates on the gamma matrix for the 2Hf similar to 6Hf alloys, no gamma' particles were found in the 9Hf alloy. The 2Hf alloy exhibits yield stress anomaly at temperatures above 600 degrees C, and the temperature corresponding to the anomalies stress peak is at about 700 degrees C. However, the other three alloys show no yield stress anomalies. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

SO COMPUTATIONAL CONDENSED MATTER
AB Using the first-principles calculations based on the density functional theory, we studied the site occupancy of Re in the Co7W6 mu phase and its effects on the electronic properties. The results of binding energy and defect formation energy show that the stability of the system was enhanced after Re doping, which indicates that Re is prone to the Co7W6 mu phase formation. The results of electronic properties calculations (the density of states and charge density difference) reveal that there exists a strong interaction between Re and its NN(nearest neighborhood) atoms, which was attributed to the d-d hybridization. Besides, the bonding strength becomes stronger as Re substituting the Co sites, which further elucidate that Re preferentially occupies the Co sites. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The effect of Nb on the properties and microstructure of two novel powder metallurgy (P/M) Ni-based superalloys was evaluated, and the results critically compared with the Rolls-Royce alloy RR1000. The Nb-containing alloy was found to exhibit improved tensile and creep properties as well as superior oxidation resistance compared with both RR1000 and the Nb-free variant tested. The beneficial effect of Nb on the tensile and creep properties was due to the microstructures obtained following the post-solution heat treatments, which led to a higher gamma' volume fraction and a finer tertiary gamma' distribution. In addition, an increase in the anti-phase-boundary energy of the gamma' phase is also expected with the addition of Nb, further contributing to the strength of the material. However, these modifications in the gamma' distribution detrimentally affect the dwell fatigue crack-growth behavior of the material, although this behavior can be improved through modified heat treatments. The oxidation resistance of the Nb-containing alloy was also enhanced as Nb is believed to accelerate the formation of a defect-free Cr2O3 scale. Overall, both developmental alloys, with and without the addition of Nb, were found to exhibit superior properties than RR1000.

TI Ionic segregation on grain boundaries in thermally grown alumina scales
SO MATERIALS AT HIGH TEMPERATURES
AB This study first examined segregation behaviour in the alumina scale formed after 100 h at 1100 degrees C on bare and MCrAlYHfSi-coated single-crystal superalloys with similar to 10 ppma La and Y. For the bare superalloy, Hf and Ti were detected on the grain boundaries of the inner columnar alumina layer. Increasing the oxidation temperature to 1200 degrees C for 2 h did not change the segregation behaviour. With the bond coating, both Y and Hf were segregated to the grain boundaries as expected. However, there was evidence of Ti-rich oxide particles near the gas interface suggesting that Ti diffused from the superalloy through the coating. To further understand these segregation observations with multiple dopants, other alumina-forming systems were examined. Alumina scale grain boundary co-segregation of Ti with Y is common for FeCrAl alloys. Co-segregation of Hf and Ti was observed in the scale formed on co-doped NiAl. No La segregation was detected in the scale formed on NiCrAl with only a 19 ppma La addition, however, the scale was adherent.

TI Hot corrosion of protective coatings
SO MATERIALS AND MANUFACTURING PROCESSES
AB Improvement in efficiencies of gas turbine engines requires a significant increase of gas inlet temperatures. This results in an increased service temperature for blade materials and consequently in enhanced oxidation and hot corrosion attack of the blade coatings, which are usually of MCrAlY type where M is Ni, Co or NiCo. This type of coating can provide protection against oxidation and hot corrosion and act as a bond coat for thermal barrier coating systems. In both cases slow growth rates and optimum adherence of the alumina scales forming on the MCrAlY coatings during high temperature exposure are significant for component life. The above mentioned properties for the alumina scales strongly depend on the coating base composition as well as on the presence of minor alloying elements. In the present paper the performance of existing superalloys during hot corrosion is briefly described followed by the results obtained on hot corrosion of MCRAlY type coatings explaining the effect of trace elements on the life of coatings in the presence of NaCl and vanadium containing environments. Optimum thickness to improve the life of superalloys with NiCoCrAlY as a bond coat and yttria stabilized zirconia thermal barrier coatings has been identified. Based on the results, an electrochemical mechanism is proposed and shows that hot corrosion of protective coatings is an electrochemical phenomenon. Hence electrochemical techniques appear to be quite useful in evaluating the coatings for hot corrosion resistance.

TI Atomic mobility evaluation and diffusion matrix for fcc_A1 Co-V-W alloys
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB On the basis of measured interdiffusivity matrices from our previous research and thermodynamic descriptions, atomic mobilities for fcc_A1 Co-V-W alloys were evaluated by diffusion controlled transformation software. For the purpose of verifying the reliability of the present atomic mobilities, comparisons between the predicted data containing interdiffusivity matrices, composition profiles, as well as diffusion paths and the experimental ones were conducted. The results demonstrate that presently obtained atomic mobilities can reproduce experimental data reasonably. Furthermore, three-dimensional surfaces for the diagonal interdiffusivities at 1373, 1423 and 1473K were plotted and were compared with measured ones, from which the pre-exponential factor and activation energy for elements V and W were then derived by means of Arrhenius equation. It is worth mentioning that all of the composition profiles and diffusion paths at three temperatures can be reasonably predicted by the present atomic mobilities containing only two ternary interaction parameters. Such a high simulation accuracy is rarely reported in the literature. The present atomic mobilities contribute to computational design for novel Co-based superalloys and multi-component cemented carbides.

SO CALPHAD-COMPUTER COUPLING OF PHASE DIAGRAMS AND THERMOCHEMISTRY
AB Primary carbides may be important for the high temperature strength of polycrystalline Cr-rich cast alloys. TaC are among the best carbides for this role. Their presence depends on the base elements of the alloys. This dependence is here studied in the case of a series of Cr-rich alloys based on Ni and/or Co and containing Ta and C in equal molar fractions. Real alloys were cast and exposed at 1400 K and 1510 K, and their as-cast and aged microstructures were characterized. In parallel thermodynamic calculations using Thermo-Calc and a home-made database were carried out. It appears that TaC is the single carbide present in the alloy stabilized at high temperature only if the Co content is higher than the Ni one. Discrepancies appeared between calculations and the experimental results, showing that the used database must be improved. The experimental part of this work provides microstructures data which can be used to test databases and to enrich them if necessary.

SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB High-velocity oxygen-fuel (HVOF) process is one of the most popular thermal spraying technologies and has been widely adopted by many industries due to its flexibility and the superior quality of coatings produced. This paper demonstrates the successful application of Stellite-6 metallic coatings on the Ni- and Fe-based superalloys by HVOF process for hot corrosion applications. The microstructure, porosity, coating thickness, phase formation and microhardness properties of the coatings were characterised using the combined techniques of optical microscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive analysis (SEM/EDAX) and electron probe microanalysis (EPMA). The coatings exhibited characteristic splatlike, layered morphologies due to the deposition and re-solidification of successive molten or semi-molten powder particles. The coating possesses porosity, unmelted and semimelted particles, and inclusions. The coatings have porosity less than 2% and hardness values in the range of 800-900 Hv. The as sprayed microstructure has a face centred cubic (fec) Co-rich metallic matrix with very small fraction of CoNiO2 spinet oxide. EDAX analysis of the coating microstructure confirmed that the coating composition is similar to the feedstock powder. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Vacancy mediated alloying strengthening effects on gamma/gamma '
   interface of Ni-based single crystal superalloys: A first-principles
   study
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB The vacancy effects on the site preferences of alloying elements Re, Mo, Ta and Cr at gamma/gamma' interface are studied using first-principles density functional theory. The alloying strengthening mechanism mediated by vacancy is also evaluated via calculating the Griffith work of fracture for gamma/gamma' interface as well as the energy barrier of vacancy migration at the interface. The calculated results show that a Ni vacancy on (001)gamma' plane does not change the most preferable substitution position of the alloying elements at corner-point Ni site on (001)gamma except Cr. These alloying elements in gamma' enhance the interfacial bonding strength of gamma/gamma' interface even with the presence of a neighboring vacancy, among which Re exhibits the best strengthening effect. The improvement in the gamma/gamma' interfacial strength is ascribed to the increased chemical bonding strength between the alloying atom and the nearest-neighbor host atom. Furthermore, a single Ni vacancy has higher migration energy barriers around the alloying solutes especially Re solute substituting on (001)gamma at gamma/gamma' interface, although the alloying solutes at these preferable sites have no contribution to the interfacial bonding strength.

AB The high-temperature Co-Re alloy [1], a promising candidate for gas turbine applications, has a complex microstructure containing various kinds of precipitates in different size scales. The nano-sized fine spherical TaC (< 100 nm) precipitates are the most important for strengthening of the alloy. In this contribution the influence of Cr addition (5 at.% and 15 at.%) on the strengthening TaC precipitates in Co-Re-Ta-C alloy with a C/Ta ratio of 0.9 is studied. The Cr content is important for the oxidation resistance of the alloy, but it also influences the size and volume fraction of TaC precipitates and consequently the possible formation of the Cr-rich Cr2Re3 (sigma phase) and Cr23C6 precipitates. In addition, Cr influences the temperature of the allotropic phase transformation of the Co matrix phase. It was found that additions of 5 at.% or 15 at.% Cr in the alloy does not result in the formation of Cr2Re3 and Cr23C6 phases. Further, the addition of such smaller amounts of Cr does not retain the Co gamma (fcc) phase (stable or metastable) at room temperature after cooling from high temperatures. Only the e (hcp) phase is present at low temperatures. The TaC precipitates are slightly influenced in size and volume fraction with 5 at.% and 15 at.% Cr.

TI Degradation behaviour of sputtered Co-Al coatings on superalloy
SO MATERIALS CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
AB Degradation behaviour of sputtered Co-Al coatings on Superni-718 substrate has been investigated. Cyclic high temperature oxidation tests were conducted on uncoated and coated samples at peak temperatures of 900 degrees C for up to 100 thermal cycles between the peak and room temperatures. The results showed that a dense scale formed on the coated samples during thermal cycling at the peak temperature of 900 degrees C. The external scale exhibited good spallation resistance during cyclic oxidation testing at both temperatures. The improvement in oxide scale spallation resistance is believed to be related to the fine-grained structure of the coating. Nanostructured Co-Al coatings on Superni-718 substrate were deposited by DC/RF magnetron sputtering. FE-SEM/EDS, AFM, and XRD were used to characterize the morphology and formation of different phases in the coatings, respectively. The Co-Al coating on superalloy substrate showed better performance of cyclic high temperature oxidation resistance due to its possession of beta-CoAl phase as Al reservoir and the formation of Al2O3 and spinel phases such as CoCr2O4 and CoAl2O4 in scale. The oxidation results confirmed an improved oxidation resistance of the Co-Al coating on superalloy as compare to bare substrate in air at 900 degrees C temperature up to 100 cycles.

SO JOURNAL OF PHASE EQUILIBRIA AND DIFFUSION
CT 32nd CALPHAD Meeting
CY MAY 25-30, 2003
CL La Malbaie, CANADA
AB The interdiffusion in Co matrix/Al particle alloys and Co/Ni-based substrates was studied using electron probe microanalysis and was simulated with the software DICTRA. Alloys were prepared by mixing elemental powders and furnace melting under an inert atmosphere. The phases involved in the study were gamma (Ni-based or Co-based), beta-CoAl, and gamma'. The alloys were single-phase (gamma) as well as two-phase (gamma + beta and gamma + gamma'). Several equilibrium points in the Al-Co-Cr system were measured and compared with the calculated diagram at 1100 degreesC. The diffusion couples were prepared to produce combinations of selected alloys and were subjected to annealing at 1100 degreesC for times up to 72 h. The diffusion calculations made with DICTRA were performed using the TCNI1 thermodynamic database together with mobility data collected from different literature sources. A literature survey on diffusion data of this system was performed, and comparisons with available data were made. The validity of the selected mobility data was checked with the composition profiles measured on some single-phase gamma/gamma diffusion couples. In the gamma + beta/gamma and gamma/gamma + gamma' diffusion couples, a regression of the dispersed phase (P or gamma') was observed due to the interdiffusion of Al. From combined experimental and theoretical results, the effects of temperature and coating thickness were determined as an input for a coating lifetime prediction model.

SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB Slip band-grain boundary interactions of gamma'-Co-3(Al,W)-strengthened Co-9Al-4.5Mo-4.5Mo-2Ta-0.02B-(0.01, 0.1)Ce alloys (referred to as 0.01Ce alloy and 0.1Ce alloy, respectively, hereafter) were investigated in-situ using SEM and TEM. For the 0.01Ce alloy with a gamma/gamma'-Co-3(Al, W) coherent microstructure, the {1 1 1} < 1 1 0 > dislocations initiate in the gamma channels and subsequently cut into the neighbouring gamma' phase. A low-angle grain boundary (LAGB) is necessary for the slip band transfer mechanism. The slip bands transfer through the LAGB when the alignment factor M > 0.8 with the incoming easy-slip system and the Schmid factor > 0.3 on the outgoing slip system. The high-angle grain boundaries (HAGBs) usually have a low M value and the incoming slip bands are blocked at the HAGBs without transfer; instead, independent slip systems with the highest Schmid factor in the neighbouring grain are activated. The plastic deformation of the gamma/gamma'-Co-3(Al,W) microstructure and the slip band-grain boundary interactions lead to an elongation of 16.4% of the 0.01Ce alloy. With some Co3W precipitates at the grain boundary of the 0.1Ce alloy, the slip bands bypass, cut through, or sometimes are arrested by the precipitates, resulting in a low elongation of 2.1% and a mixed dimple and cleavage failure.

AB Co-Re-based alloys are candidates for high-temperature applications in gas turbines. The addition of boron largely increases their ductility. The stability of the Co-solid solution matrix and of the strengthening TaC minority phase at the foreseen alloy operation temperatures (>= 1200 degrees C), potentially influenced by the presence of boron, has to be considered. The hcp to fcc transformation of the Co-solid solution matrix and the TaC minority phase evolution was thus investigated in Co-Re-Ta-C alloy with varying boron addition by in situ neutron diffraction at temperatures up to 1500 degrees C in high vacuum furnace. The neutron diffraction showed that the boron addition has no significant influence on TaC volume fraction during heating to high temperatures. In 0, 0.1, and 0.4 at.% B alloys, a strong decrease of the TaC volume fraction was observed above 1300 degrees C. Nevertheless, TaC has significant volume fraction up to that temperature and, therefore, can be effective for strengthening. The measurements further showed that while a small amount of boron addition (0.1 at.% B) has no influence on the matrix transformation and its hysteresis, a large boron addition (0.4 at.% B) influences the matrix transformation temperature significantly (lowers it by about 100 K) and, moreover, boron promotes massive Co sublimation at very high temperatures (>= 1470 degrees C). Further, re-appearance of the hcp phase around 1400 degrees C in 0.4 at.% B alloy was observed and explained by a slow sublimation of Co in high vacuum. It is not a problem from the technological point of view as vacuum is not a turbine operation condition, and as the high-temperature components are regularly protected by a coating.

TI Structural stability and mechanical properties of Co-3 (Al, M) (M = Ti,
   V, Cr, Zr, Nb, Mo, Hf, Ta, W) compounds
SO COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB The structural stability and mechanical properties of Co-3 (Al, M) (M = Ti, V, Cr, Zr, Nb, Mo, Hf, Ta, W) compounds with cubic L-12 -type and hexagonal D0(19)-type structures have been investigated by first-principles calculations. Calculated temperature-dependent formation energies indicate that all the L-12-type Co-3 (Al, M) can be generated at high temperature and show better stability than their D0(19)-type according to the quasi-harmonic Debye model. Furthermore, we reveal that the element Al plays a major role in promoting L-12 structure more stable than D0(19) structure for the Co-3 (Al, W), and the element W reduces metastability as well as improves the strength of L-12. We also find that most of the L-12-Co-3 (Al, M) compounds possess good mechanical stability and ductility, which are verified by the elastic constants and Poisson's ratio. More importantly, the element Cr can be used to replace the W of L-12-Co-3 (Al, W) to increase the strength to weight ratio as the L-12-Co-3 (Al, Cr) possesses comparable elastic properties to the L-12-Co-3 (Al, W), including the Young's and shear moduli. It is also observed that all the L-12-Co-3 (Al, M) compounds show a high degree of elastic anisotropy. The electron localized function and suggests that the rise of the Young's moduli in Co-3 (Al, M), with the alloying element M changing from group IVB to VIB, is mainly attributed by the increasing bonding strength of the nearby transition-metal atoms. Our results will be useful for the study of thermodynamic and mechanical properties as well as the design of Co-based high-temperature alloys. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Microtensile creep testing of freestanding MCrAlY bond coats
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS RESEARCH
AB Bond coats are essential in gas turbine technology for oxidation protection. Freestanding MCrAlY ( M = Ni, Co) bond coats were investigated with respect to their creep strength at elevated temperatures. Three types of MCrAlY, a Ni- based bond coat Amdry 386, a Co- based bond coat Amdry 9954 and Amdry 9954 + 2 wt% Al2O3 ( ODS = oxide dispersion strengthened) produced by low pressure plasma spraying, were analyzed. The two phase microstructure of the bond coats consists of a fcc c- Ni solid solution and a B2 b- NiAl phase. Constant load experiments were performed in a thermomechanical analyzer at temperatures between 900 and 950 degrees C. Microtensile test specimens with a diameter of 450 lm were produced by a high- precision grinding and polishing process. Creep rupture was mainly due to void nucleation along the b- c interfaces and grain boundaries. The time to failure is larger in Ni- based Amdry 386 compared to that in Co- based Amdry 9954 due to a higher fraction of the high- strength b- NiAl phase at test temperatures. The addition of ODS- particles in the Co- based bond coat Amdry 9954 resulted in a better creep resistance but lower ductility in comparison to ODSparticle- free Amdry 9954.

TI Densification and microstructural evolution during co-sintering of
   Ni-base superalloy powders
SO METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND
   MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB This work presents the effect of co-sintering on the densification and microstructural evolution in the two-layer stepwise graded composite of INCONEL 718 and INCONEL 625 superalloys. A pressureless co-sintering method in conjunction with a powder layering technique was used. The sintering was carried out in solid state and liquid phase in temperature ranging from 1260 degrees C through 1300 degrees C for 60 minutes in a low pressure of an argon atmosphere. Nonisothermal sintering behavior was also examined by dilatometric analysis. Similarly, the sintering response of the individual layers was characterized. The results reveal an enhanced densification rate during co-sintering of the composite layers. Sintering at low temperatures (T < 1270 degrees C) led to formation of a narrow dense region at the interface while the sintered layers were porous. In contrast, sintering at higher temperatures resulted in significant densification of the layers, although formation of a pore band at the interface was realized. It is suggested that the strain rate incompatibility between the layers during sintering induces mismatch stresses at the interface region. The resulting strain energy influences the densification of the boundary region by exerting a pressure on the sintering neck and affecting the material flow during liquid phase sintering. The induced densification of the bilayer configuration was experimentally measured and was shown to be in good agreement with the strain rate incompatibility.

TI CONTROL OF MICROSTRUCTURES BY HEAT TREATMENTS AND HIGH-TEMPERATURE
   PROPERTIES IN HIGH-TUNGSTEN COBALT-BASE SUPERALLOYS
SO HANDBOOK OF MATERIAL SCIENCE RESEARCH
SE Materials Science and Technologies
AB Cobalt-base HS-21 (L-605) alloy has high strength and good oxidation resistance at high temperatures, and is widely used for high-temperature components including blades, vanes and combustor parts in the hot sections of jet engines. In this study, effects of microstructures on the creep-rupture properties were investigated on the heat-treated specimens of the HS-25 (L-605) type heat-resistant alloys containing about 14 to 20% (mass %) tungsten (W) at 1089 and 1311 K. Serrated grain boundaries which were formed by precipitation of W-rich phase and M(6)C carbide by heat treatment, improved rupture strength without significant loss of creep ductility. Ageing for 1080 ks (300 h) at 1273 K (1000 degrees C) caused similar precipitates on grain boundaries and in grains, and also increased rupture strength in the specimens with normal straight grain boundaries. Improvement of the rupture properties by heat treatments was remarkable in the alloys with the higher W content at 1089 K, while such heat treatments were effective in relatively short-term creep at 1311 K. In the non-aged specimens with straight grain boundaries, the rupture strength increased with increasing W content at 13 11 K, although the rupture strength was not improved largely with increasing W content at 1089 K. The principal strengthening mechanism in these alloys was attributed to the strengthening of grain boundaries and grains by precipitates of W-rich phase and carbide phases in addition to solid-solution strengthening by W atoms. The strengthening of grains by high-temperature ageing was comparable with the strengthening by serrated grain boundaries in the high-tungsten cobalt-base alloys at 1089 K. Fracture surfaces of specimens with serrated grain boundaries and those of aged specimens were ductile grain-boundary fracture surfaces with small dimples and ledges, while the non-aged specimens with straight grain boundaries exhibited brittle grain-boundary facets at 1089 K.

TI Viscoplastic constitutive equations of combustion chamber materials
   including cyclic hardening and dynamic strain aging
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLASTICITY
AB Cobalt-base and nickel-base superalloys for aircraft engine combustion chamber applications (e.g. Haynes 188, Haynes 230, Hastelloy X) show a complex viscoplastic behavior. In a large temperature range from 300 to 800 degrees C, an important cyclic hardening with memory effects combined with a negative strain rate sensitivity are observed. This behavior can be related to the dynamic strain aging phenomenon. The present contribution aims at proposing a set of constitutive equations that are able to predict those experimental observations. A classical unified viscoplastic framework is coupled with a physically motivated macroscopic modeling of dynamic strain aging initially introduced by McCormick and Kubin, Estrin. The complete model has been identified on original multilevel and multirate cyclic experiments and cyclic relaxation experiments on the Haynes 188 alloy. The predictive abilities of the model are demonstrated by simulations of a large set of experimental data including fatigue tests from the literature. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The solidified experiments of samples were carried out in a silicon carbon tube furnace with following water quenching. Microstructure of samples and subsequent compositional analysis of solidified ones were determined by an optical microscope (OM) and electronic probe micro analysis (EPMA), respectively. The results show the initial temperature, final temperature and the temperature interval of solidification keep constant with increasing content of Re in alloys under the test conditions, demonstrating the similar solidification sequences. With increasing Re element in alloy, the segregation coefficient of Al, Cr, Co, Mo, and Ta slightly varies, but the segregation coefficient of W obviously decreases.

TI Wetting and interfacial behavior of Ni-Si alloy on different substrates
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Wetting of molten Ni-56 at.% Si alloy on different substrates (SiC ceramic, Ni- and Co-based superalloys, Kovar, and Mo) are performed under different experimental conditions by the sessile drop technique. Temperature, atmosphere, and substrate composition play the key roles in determining the wettability, the spreading characteristics, and the interfacial morphology of the final interfaces. The non-reactive wetting characteristics in Ni-Si/SiC system are confirmed, with a spreading rate increasing with temperature increasing. In the Ni-Si/metal systems the spreading process is determined by the competition between spreading along the substrate surface and the interfacial interactions. Excellent wettability and fast spreading are found in the Ni-Si/Co-based superalloy, Ni-Si/Kovar, and Ni-Si/Mo systems at both the temperatures (1100 and 1200 A degrees C). These results can be used as a reference guide for joining SiC to these metallic components, or to itself, using the Ni-Si alloy as filler metal.

TI Wear resistant carbon fiber reinforced Stellite alloy composites
SO MATERIALS & DESIGN
AB Stellite alloys are a family of cobalt-based superalloys that are the main engineering materials used for severe corrosion, wear and high temperature environments. These alloys are strengthened by various carbides. However, the presence of carbides can cause many problems although they are main agents for wear resistance. This research attempts to develop a class of novel composite materials which substitute carbon of Stellite alloys with carbon fiber, aiming to minimize the disadvantageous effects of carbides in the alloys. Two types of carbon fiber, plain carbon fiber and nickel-coated carbon fiber, are employed in the composites. The new materials are fabricated using hot isostatic pressing (HIP) technique. The microstructures of these composites are analyzed to investigate if any carbides are induced due to incorporating carbon fibers. The tribological properties of these new composites are characterized on a pin-on-disk tribometer. The experimental results show that the developed composites exhibit better wear resistance than that of medium-carbon Stellite alloys and comparable wear resistance to that of high-carbon Stellite alloys.

TI The Thermal Stability and Strength of Highly Alloyed Ni3Al
SO MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS
AB In this study the Ll(2) gamma prime phase (based on Ni3Al) has been highly alloyed with Cr, Co, W, and Ta in order to examine the effects on strengthening and thermal stability. The order-disorder transition temperature of gamma prime is decreased with higher alloying content. Thermodynamic calculations show that the ordering enthalpy decreases as the entropy term increases. Conversely, the hardness can be 1.5 times higher comparing to that of a conventional Ni-based superalloy. This indicates that the strengthening effect of designing a gamma prime composition toward higher entropy is significant, due to greater lattice distortion and higher anti-phase boundary energy of gamma prime.

TI On the control of structural/compositional ratio of coherent
   order-disorder interfaces
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Order-disorder coherent interfaces determine the microstructure and mechanical properties of precipitation-hardened high-temperature alloys. The characteristics of these interfaces can be defined by a compositional width, delta, and structural width, delta'. The latter, which can be considered as the width of the ordered part of the interface, can play an important role in high-temperature mechanical behavior of precipitation-hardened alloys. This is due to the fact that diffusion in the ordered part of the interface is generally much slower than diffusion in the disordered phase, thus hindering the solid-state diffusion-based phenomena. Here, we investigate the order-disorder interface in a Ni-19Al (at.%) alloy as a model alloy for Ni-based superalloys using atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy and three-dimensional atom probe tomography. Then, we employ thermodynamic modeling to describe the interplay between the structural and compositional interface widths in binary Ni-Al and in ternary Ni-Al-Cr and Co-Al-W systems. We introduce the delta'/delta ratio as a critical parameter that varies significantly in different alloys. Our findings offer a general pathway to control the delta'/delta ratio of interfaces, which in turn affect the high-temperature properties of precipitation-hardened alloys. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

TI The grain boundary pinning effect of the mu phase in an advanced
   polycrystalline gamma/gamma' Co-base superalloy
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB A grain boundary pinning phase was introduced into a gamma/gamma' Co-base superalloy by the addition of Mo. The intermetallic phase was identified as mu phase (Co,Ni,Cr)(7)(W,Mo)6 by high-energy X-ray diffraction and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy in the transmission electron microscope. Synchrotron radiation insitu heating experiments confirmed the stability of the grain structure up to 1050 degrees C and therefore the grain boundary pinning effect of this phase. Recrystallization heat treatments at different temperatures resulted in varying amounts of mu phase. The grain size analysis revealed that at least 1% of the phase is necessary to maintain a pinning effect during recrystallization. Atom probe tomography confirmed that Mo partitioned predominantly to the gamma phase. Since the mu phase and the gamma' phase are competing for W, a lower gamma volume fraction was formed in comparison to a Mo-free polycrystalline gamma/gamma' Co-base superalloy variant. However, the homogeneous distribution of small grains resulted in a higher strength compared to the Mo-free alloy without grain boundary pinning phases. The creep resistance at 750 degrees C was similar to the Mo-free alloy as well as the polycrystalline Ni-base superalloy U720Li with a creep rate minimum of 1.5 x 10(-7) s(-1) at 620 MPa.

TI Effects of alloying elements on relative phase stability and elastic
   properties of L1(2) Co3V from first-principles calculations
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Nineteen transition metal elements have been taken into account to study the alloying effects on the relative phase stability, elastic properties and electronic structure of L1(2) Co3V compound, based on the first-principles calculations. The site preference of ternary alloying elements was primarily determined with the help of normalized transfer energy. According to the results, four groups of alloying elements were classified, namely strong/weak V site preference and strong/weak Co site preference. In view of relative phase stability, we found that the Co-V-Hf, Co-V-Ir and Co-V-Pt systems have strong potential to precipitate the stable gamma' phase, other than Co-V-Ti, Co-V-Ta systems that have been experimentally reported. The stabilizing effect of ternary alloying elements on gamma' phase has an order of Ti > Ta > Hf > Ir > Pt > Nb > Zr > Rh > Sc > W. By using stress-strain method, the elastic properties including bulk modulus, shear modulus and Young's modulus were evaluated. Significantly, the intrinsic linear relationship between elastic properties and electron density per molar volume was revealed. It is found that the shear moduli G ({110}) and G ({111}) of L1(2) Co3V compound are increased by alloying Cr, Tc, Re and Pt elements, while reduced by other transition metal elements. To understand the mechanism, we employed the charge density difference to characterize the electronic structure of some typical X-substituted L1(2) Co3V compounds. The results successfully associate the shear moduli of these compounds with the anisotropic distribution of transfer electron density.

TI Effect of Ru on the Oxidation Behavior of a Ni-Base Single-Crystal
   Superalloy
SO SCIENCE OF ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB The effect of Ru on the isothermal oxidation of Ni-base single crystal superalloys has been investigated by discontinuous thermogravimetric analysis. The scale structures were analyzed using XRD, SEM and EDX. The kinetic curves of the alloys exposed at 1000 degrees C and 1100 degrees C obeyed the parabolic law, and the addition of Ru had minimal direct effect on the oxide phase types. The scales for three alloys with various Ru additions were mainly composed of an outer (Ni, Co) O layer, a second complex oxides layer, and an inner Al2O3 layer. The spallation of the scale was observed after a long time oxidation at 1000 degrees C and 1100 degrees C. The mass gains of the alloys with Ru addition were higher than those of the alloys without Ru addition when exposed to high temperatures at 1000 degrees C and 1100 degrees C. This showed that the addition of Ru can reduce the oxidation resistance in the alloy oxidation at high temperatures due to Ru inhibiting the formation of Al2O3 layer. Furthermore, the rate of oxidation for the alloy with 3 Ru addition at 1100 degrees C was slower than that of the alloy with 1.5 Ru addition since the weak-bond in NiWO4 was limited by Ru addition. The internal nitride was obtained from the three alloys with Ru addition due to the loose Al2O3 films.

TI High-speed intermittent turning of GH2132 alloy with Si3N4/(W, Ti)C/Co
   graded ceramic tool
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY
AB In this paper, a new Si3N4-based graded ceramic tool was prepared by hot press technology The tool was toughened by microscale (W, Ti)C, nanoscale Si3N4, and metal Co. The graded structure combing with proper composition distribution introduced thermal residual compressive stress into the surface layer of the tool according to the FEM analysis. The performance of the tool in high-speed intermittent turning GH2132 alloy (equivalent to A286) was studied in contrast to one homogeneous tool. The cutting forces analysis indicates that the inserts endure periodic mechanical shock in the intermittent cutting process and the mechanical shock is more serious when the tooth engages the workpiece than when it disengages the workpiece. The tool failure modes observation shows ladder-like fracture under thermal and mechanical shock in the intermittent cutting process. Tool failure mechanisms involve chipping, flaking, microcracks, and adhesion. The graded tool shows better thermal and mechanical shock resistance than the homogeneous tool due to the formation of residual compressive stress.

AB Co-Al-W alloys strengthened with the L1(2) gamma-prime phase have promise as next generation high temperature materials due to the ability to engineer a high gamma-prime content alloy with a higher gammaprime solvus and higher melting point than many Ni-base gamma-prime strengthened alloys. Furthermore, these Co-Al-W gamma-prime alloys are interesting as potential cast-and-wrought alloys because they have a relatively narrow range of solidification temperature and large range of temperature between the gamma-prime solvus and the solidus, suggesting than manufacturing via an ingot metallurgy route would be feasible. However, since J. Sato et al discovered gamma-prime in the Co-Al-W alloy system in 2006, the focus in the literature has been on characterizing the structure and properties of these alloys and measuring and assessing the thermodynamics of the alloy system primarily for application as castings for turbine blade applications. To date the author is not aware of any publications describing the microstructure of vacuum induction melted, vacuum arc remelted ingots of a size more than about 2kg. Most work has been performed using small, laboratory-scale, cast-and-hot-rolled samples or samples cast as single crystals. This paper presents ATI's experience in assessing the feasibility of manufacturing a cast-and-wrought billet product in the Co-Al-W-X alloy system. Three 22 kg heats were produced to examine a small range of alloy compositions of potential commercial interest: Co-9Al-9W, Co-9Al-10W-2Ti, and Co-9Al-10W- 2Ti-0.02B, respectively. Each heat was vacuum-induction-melted and vacuum-arc-remelted then open-die forged. The ingot microstructure has been characterized. Hot workability during billetizing will be described and microstructure and hardness of hot worked and heat treated product will be presented.

TI Microstructural changes as postmortem temperature indicator in

SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB Microstructural changes in a metallic oxidation protection coating (Ni-Co-Cr-Al-Y) applied on a nickel base superalloy were investigated by means of scanning and transmission electron microscopy. The changes are due either to thermal mechanical fatigue testing under high thermal gradients or to defined isothermal heat treatments. The coated specimens were quenched from temperatures between 840 and 1100degreesC to ambient temperature. The resultant phases, their local distribution and compositions were determined by energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy and electron diffraction. Phase equilibria at respective temperatures were determined by thermodynamic calculations based on the CALPHAD method. The calculated and experimentally determined phase distributions were compared. A particular microstructural feature, namely the existence and spatial distribution of spherical gamma' Ni3Al precipitates in the coating and the diffusion zone between substrate and coating, was used as a postmortem indicator for the maximum temperature experienced by the specimen during testing. This paper gives a road map for developing a microstructural-based temperature calibration for complex metallic materials using thermodynamic simulations. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SO PHYSICA B-CONDENSED MATTER
AB First-principles calculations were performed to study the properties of O adsorption on Ni3Al (0 0 1), (0 1 1), and (1 1 1) surfaces using the Cambridge serial total package (CASTEP) code. Stable adsorption sites are identified. The atomic and electronic structures and adsorption energies are predicted. The adsorption sites for O on the Ni3Al (0 0 1) surface are at the 2Ni-2Al fourfold hollow site, whereas O prefers to adsorb at the Ni-Al bridge site on (0 1 1) surface and 2Ni-Al threefold hollow site on (1 1 1) surface. It is found that O shows the strongest affinity for Al and the state of O is the most stabilized when O adsorbs on (0 0 1) surface, while the affinity of O for Al on (0 1 1) surface is weaker than (0 0 1) surface, and (1 1 1) surface is the weakest. The stronger O and Al affinity indicates more stable Al2O3 when oxidized. The experiment has shown that the oxidation resistance of single crystal superalloy in different orientations improves in the order of (1 11), (0 1 1), and (0 0 1) surface, suggesting that the oxidation in different crystallographic orientations may be related to the affinity of O for Al in the surface.

TI The detection and sizing of flaws in components from the hot-end of gas
   turbines using phase-contrast radiography with neutrons: a feasibility
   study
SO NDT & E INTERNATIONAL
AB In this paper we present a feasibility study of the use of phase contrast radiography in the examination of components from the hot-section of gas turbine engines. These components are usually made from dense materials (nickel or cobalt based superalloys) and, consequently, radiographic examination requires either high energy X-rays (above 60 keV) or neutrons. The relative merits of employing X-rays and neutrons for phase contrast radiography are compared. It is shown that, for similar penetration, neutrons offer better sensitivity and that it should be possible to detect even micron-wide cracks orientated perpendicular to the incident rays. Simulation shows that, for cracks parallel to the incident rays, crack growth in increments of microns can be resolved by monitoring the development of the Fresnel diffraction pattern. Some preliminary experimental results are also presented that demonstrate an improvement over conventional neutron radiography. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI FORMATION OF CONDENSED CHLORIDES DURING MIXED OXIDATION CHLORINATION OF
   IRON AT 1000-K
SO CORROSION
AB The mixed oxidation-chlorination of iron in gas mixtures of Ar, O2, and Cl2 at 1000 K has been investigated by thermogravimetric analysis and examination of the corrosion products by optical and scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction analysis.  Vapor phase transport of iron chlorides influences the rate of oxidation-chlorination when the concentration of chlorine in the gas mixture is low.  When the concentration of chlorine in the gas mixture is high enough to support the formation of a liquid iron chloride deposit on the corroding surface, fluxing of the oxide scale can produce much faster corrosion than is observed in lower chlorine environments.  An equation is proposed to predict the conditions under which this form of attack can occur.  Because the vapor pressure of iron chloride increases rapidly with temperature, this form of corrosion can only occur in a narrow range of temperatures just above the melting point of FeCl2.

SO JOURNAL OF FAILURE ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION
AB Components in energy-producing systems suffer a variety of degradation processes such as oxidation and molten salt-induced corrosion as a consequence of complex multi-component gaseous environment. Coatings provide a composition that will grow the protective scale at high temperatures having long-term stability. Plasma spraying was used to deposit CoCrAlY + WC-Co composite coatings on turbine alloys of Hastelloy X and AISI 321. The thermocyclic oxidation behavior of coated alloys was investigated in static air and in molten salt (Na2SO4-60%V2O5) environment at 700 degrees C. The thermogravimetric technique was used to approximate the kinetics of oxidation in 50 cycles, each cycle consisting of heating and cooling. X-ray diffraction and SEM/EDAX techniques are used to characterize the oxide scale formed. Coated alloys showed a lower corrosion rate as compared to uncoated alloys. The coatings subjected to oxidation and hot corrosion showed slow scale growth kinetics. Preferential oxidation of Co, Cr, W and its spinel blocks the transport of oxygen and corrosive species into the coating by providing a barrier, thereby making the oxidation rate to reach steady state. As compared to the substrate alloys, coatings show better hot corrosion resistance.

AB With the aim of achieving an enhanced high-temperature strength compared to the Co-Ni-Al-W-Ti-Ta alloy from our previous study, a new single crystalline CoNi-base superalloy has been developed based on thermodynamic calculations. The gamma' solvus temperature and the gamma' volume fraction were experimentally determined as 1247 degrees C and 85.2%. Thermodynamic calculations correctly predict the tendency of how the alloying elements influence the thermophysical properties of investigated alloys. In comparison with the original Co-Ni-Al-W-Ti-Ta alloy, the newly developed CoNi-base alloy exhibited stronger compressive strength ranging from the room temperature to 1100 degrees C. The deformation behaviors at different temperature stages were investigated in detail. Interestingly, superlattice intrinsic stacking faults (SISFs) appear in the specimen deformed at the anomalous peak temperature, whereas the formation of SISF in the original Co-Ni-Al-W-Ti-Ta alloy occurs as the compression temperature increases beyond the anomalous peak temperature. The relationship between the occurrence of planar defects and the alloying effects was discussed.

AB Aluminum diffusion coatings enriched with silicon were prepared by chemical vapor deposition on various nickel-based materials such as almost pure nickel and Rene 80. Aluminum and silicon chloride served as precursors. They were generated in-situ by feeding gaseous hydrogen chloride (HCl) into a heated reaction chamber (1100 degrees C) which contained aluminum and silicon donating material. An excess of hydrogen gas flow was found to improve the coating growth Fate. Due to the high reactivity of aluminum, high ratios of silicon to aluminum donator had to be maintained (at least 10: 1). The coating thickness was determined from glow discharge spectroscopy and metallographic cross sections. Co-deposition and two-step deposition (first aluminizing and then siliconizing) were performed. Silicon contents of up to 50 at.% could be achieved. In contrast, a two-step process including first aluminizing and then siliconizing leads to an undesired replacement of aluminide by silicide. Al-Si diffusion coatings could be realized on internal cooling channels of turbine airfoils by single-step co-deposition. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Sintering of WC hardmetals with Ni-Co-Cr-Ti-Al multi-component alloys
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REFRACTORY METALS & HARD MATERIALS
AB Cemented carbides with Ni-Co-Cr-Al-W binder phases have been obtained from WC-Ni-Co-Cr3C2-TiAl3 powder mixtures by using standard hardmetal processing routes. Dilatometric and DSC experiments confirm that melting events and shrinkage in these materials are shifted towards higher temperatures as the Al content increases. It is also shown that sintering in Argon is enhanced at very low Al levels (0.63 wt%), which is likely due to the efficient reduction of powder oxides via direct reaction with TiAl3. For higher Al additions, HIP treatments are needed in order to remove the residual porosity left after vacuum sintering. Microstructural characterization confirms that Al additions induce two types of precipitation phenomena in the metallic binder phase of these hardmetals: one consisting of very fine Al-rich oxides (product of the aforementioned powder oxide reduction) and the other comprising even finer gamma' type cuboids (similar to those found in Ni superalloys). As confirmed by TEM-EDS analyses, the binder phase of these cemented carbides is a multicomponent alloy incluiding Co, Ni, Cr, W and increasing amounts of Al as TiAl3 addition increases. About 0.5 wt% Al is lost to the powder oxides reduction process. TiAl3 additions have a significant hardening effect on WC-Ni-Co-Cr3C2 alloys. This is due to its effective role as WC grain growth inhibitor. Although, solution-aging treatments induce a finer and more homogeneous precipitation of the gamma' phase in these materials, their hardness is slighlty reduced if compared to that of as-HIPed samples.

TI Oxidation Behavior of Modified Low Thermal Expansion Thermo-Span
   Superalloy at 650 degrees C
SO RARE METAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING
AB Modified Thermo-Span superalloys of low thermal expansion have high comprehensive tensile and low thermal expansion coefficient. Compare to standard alloy, their Cr element content was decreased and Al element was increased. By means of thermogravimetry (TG), scanning electron microscopy equipped with electron probe (EPMA), the distribution of trace element B in Thermo-Span alloy and its influence on oxidation behavior at 650 degrees C for 100 h have been investigated. The results show that B element in modified Thermo-Span alloy can accelerate precipitation on grain boundaries, and boride precipitation in grain boundaries. The oxidization behavior follows the parabolic curve rule. During the oxidation process, Fe and Co diffuse from the matrix to the outside oxidation layer, and Al, Cr and Ti diffuse from the transition layer towards the matrix. Fe, Co and 0 elements enrich on surface oxidation layer, which forms oxides of Fe and Co, and oxides of Fe in standard alloy. At the same time, Al and Cr are leaning to enrich in the layer between the surface layer and matrix, and there is no Fe and Co element in this middle layer. Boride resists the diffusion of iron from the matrix to the oxidation layer, decreasing the Fe element diffuses outside, the surface oxides of Fe decreasing, and forming the oxides of Fe and Co, hence decreasing the oxide rate of modification Thermo-Span alloy at 650 degrees C for 100 h, and increasing its oxidation resistance.

TI ALLOY DESIGN AND MICROSTRUCTURE OF A BIOMEDICAL CO-CR ALLOY
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Two wrought Co-Cr alloys for dental and surgical implant and equipment applications were designed and their microstructures and hot workability determined and compared to a current dental alloy SC--H. The chemical composition of the alloys was selected with regard to the general requirements for biomedical alloys and the general principles of alloying theory. A phase-control law originally developed for nickel-base superalloys, PHACOMP, was utilized in order to avoid the formation of topologically close-packed (t c p) phases and to ensure the ductility and workability of the alloy. The alloys were cast using a vacuum induction melting technique which was found to allow a fairly good chemical composition control of the alloys. Hot forging of the as-cast alloys confirmed their good workability. Optical metallography showed the as-cast alloys to have a dendritic structure with some spherical carbide particles in the interdendrite regions. In contrast, the dental alloy SC-H in the as-cast condition had continuous carbide along the grain boundaries which impaired the ductility and prevented hot forging of this alloy due to cracking of the specimens. X-ray diffraction analysis showed that both alloys I and II have the fcc-Co matrix and Cr23C6 type carbide particles. No tcp phases were observed.

TI Co-deposition of Ir-containing Zr coating by double glow plasma
SO ACTA ASTRONAUTICA
AB Ir-Zr co-deposition coatings with 71 at% Zr were deposited on graphite by double glow plasma at 1073-1123 K. The structure and composition of the coatings were confirmed by FE-SEM, XRD, XPS and EDS. The hardness and the elastic modulus of the coatings were estimated by nanoindentation instrument. The adhesion strength between the coating and the substrate was evaluated by a scratch tester. The results showed that the coating was composed of nanocrystalline grains with a size of 80-90 nm compared with 0.5 mu m for the pure It coating. The fine grains of the coatings might be attributed to the additional Zr element. New phases IrZr and ZrC were formed due to the high content of Zr and high deposition temperature. The hardness and elastic modulus of the coatings were about 7.5 GPa and 388 GPa, respectively. The adhesive force between the coating and the substrate was about 10 N. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

TI The influence of C/Ta ratio on TaC precipitates in Co-Re base alloys
   investigated by small-angle neutron scattering
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB Co-Re alloys are being developed to supplement Ni-base superalloys in future gas turbines for ultra-high temperature applications. The finely distributed mono-carbide phase of TaC is an important strengthening phase in this alloy, and interacts with dislocations during high temperature creep deformation. This study aims to determine and to understand the volume fraction and size distribution of TaC precipitates in dependence of C/Ta stoichiometry and heat treatment by means of in-situ small-angle neutron scattering. At measuring temperatures of 1173 K, 1373 K and 1473 K, a stable population of fine TaC <100 nm size is formed during ageing for a wide range of C/Ta stoichiometry but with considerably different volume fraction and coarsening behavior. Important parameters for mechanical properties of the material, such as particle size distribution and inter-particle distance, were determined. It is shown that the phase transformation from gamma-matrix (fcc) <-> epsilon-matrix (hcp) of the Co-Re matrix has a considerable influence on the TaC precipitate formation.

TI Diffusion processes in multicomponent nickel-base superalloy-nickel
   system
SO PHYSICS OF METALS AND METALLOGRAPHY
AB Optical and scanning electron microscopy, as well as electron microprobe analysis and electron backscatter diffraction, have been used to study diffusion processes that occur in a diffusion pair that consistsof a single-crystal CMSX-10 nickel-base superalloy and polycrystalline nickel, at temperatures of 1050-1250A degrees C. It has been found that, in this system, the distributions of gamma-stabilizing elements (Cr, Co, W, and Re) are described by the Boltzmann solution for diffusion between two semiinfinite plates of a binary alloy. The processing of these distributions has shown that the diffusion coefficients of Cr, Co, W, and Re in the multicomponent system are close to those in binary alloys of these elements with Ni. The diffusion redistribution of the elements leads to the dissolution of the gamma' phase in the nickel-base superalloy, growth of nickel grains toward the superalloy constituent of the diffusion pair, and the formation of porosity on both sides of the migrating interface, which is determined from a crystal misorientation of the alloy single crystal and nickel grains.

TI Characteristic of temperature change in co-deposition of Al and Fe on
   copper by pack cementation
SO THERMOCHIMICA ACTA
AB An experimental apparatus was set up to simulate co-deposition of Al and Fe on copper by pack cementation. The thermal history in the coating processes has been measured by K-type thermocouples. The effect of the pack mixture, holding temperature and heating rate on the temperature change on a copper surface were examined. The experimental results showed that a high Al and Fe mass fraction in pack mixture causes an obvious temperature fluctuation while the NH4Cl mass fraction and the Al2O3 mass fraction only slightly affect the temperature change. Two distinct jumps in the temperature of the sample occurred for all the experimental runs, which are strongly affected by the holding temperature. The heating rate of the pack mixture has a significant effect on the temperature change of the substrate surface. High heating rates cause an unsteady temperature change on the substrate surface.

TI Microstructure and wear behavior of AlxCo1.5CrFeNi1.5Tiy high-entropy
   alloys
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB A series of AL(x)Co(1.5)CrFeNi(1.5)Ti(y) high-entropy alloys with different Al and Ti contents were designed, and their phase and microstructure were investigated. The adhesive wear behavior and mechanism were also studied and compared with the conventional wear-resistant steels SUJ2 and SKH51. The amounts of Al and Ti strongly affect the phase and microstructure, particularly the amount and morphology of the hard eta-(Ni, Co)(3)Ti phase. It was found that the wear resistance of the Co1.5CrFeNi1.5Ti and Al0.2Co1.5CrFeNi1.5Ti alloys is at least two times better than that of conventional wear-resistant steels with similar hardness. The excellent anti-oxidation property and resistance to thermal softening in these high-entropy alloys are proposed to be the main reasons for the outstanding wear resistance.

TI Mechanism of Al-Si codeposition on In738LC through single-step diffusion
   process
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SURFACE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
AB The out-of-pack cementation method was applied to coat the Nickel-based super alloy IN738LC with Si-modified aluminide. Different mixtures of the pack containing pure Al, Si, alumina powders as an inert filler, and NH4Cl as a halide salt activator were used for co-deposition at 950 and 1,050 degrees C. The results showed although the amount of subhalide vapour pressures of Al and Si were equal at 1,050 degrees C, Al atoms diffused only after Si atoms had been deposited. Before heat treatment, the coating thickness formed by the pack containing 2.3 wt.% Al was 6 mu m more than that containing 3.5 wt.% Al. After heat treatment, thickening coatings formed within the pack containing 2.3 wt.% Al was less than that obtained in the other pack containing 3.5 wt.% Al. This study suggests that increasing the depositing temperature will increase the thickness at a constant composition of the pack powder.

TI The influence of Mo on Suzuki-segregation-related microstructure
   evolution and mechanical properties of Co-Ni-based superalloy
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Mo, as one of the most important elements in superalloy, dramatically affected the microstructure and mechanical properties via solution strengthening, forming Mo-enriched phase, and atomic segregation (Suzuki effect). To verify the influence of Mo on the microstructure and mechanical properties of Ni-Co-based superalloy, two types of alloys containing 4 wt% (A4) and 8 wt% (A8) Mo were prepared. The microstructure was examined using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope, and transmission electron microscope, while the mechanical properties were evaluated using tensile tests at both room temperature and elevated temperature (700 degrees C). The segregation of Mo at stacking faults was observed in both alloys after aging with pre-cold-rolling. At the same time, in alloy A8, direct precipitation of mu phase both along grain boundary and in the interior of matrix was observed after aging. In alloy A4, segregation of Mo along stacking fault ribbons resulted in formation of quasi-mu phase. The quasi-mu phase developed into mu phase during prolonged aging. There was no precipitate along grain boundary in A4 after aging resulting in poor ductility at both room and elevated temperature. The strength was enhanced by net effect of Suzuki segregation, gamma' phase strengthening, and fine mu phase. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Deposition of a B-modified silicide coating for Nb-Si based alloy
   oxidation protection
SO CORROSION SCIENCE
AB A B-modified silicide coating was prepared on the Nb-Si based alloy by Si-TiB2 co-deposition at 1300 degrees C for 10 h. The results show that the two-layer coating is composed of a (Nb, X)Si-2 (X represents Al, Cr, Ti and Hf) + NbTiB4 outer layer and a (Nb, X)Si-2 + Cr2Nb inner layer. Static oxidation tests indicate that the mass gain of B-modified silicide coating was 2.39 mg/cm(2) after oxidation at 1250 degrees C for 100 h. The good oxidation resistance is attributed to the formation of a continuous and dense scale mainly consisting of glassy borosilicate. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

SO RARE METAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING
AB Evolution of oxidation scale for a Ni-22Cr-20Co-18W alloy at 1100 degrees C was investigated by means of XRD and SEM (EDS). The results show that at the initial stage of the oxidation, a oxide scale of the mixture of Cr2O3, NiO and (Ni, Co, Mn, Cr)(3)O-4, which is of M3O4 type, is formed on the surface. The single-layer oxide film changes into double layer one after long time oxidation, the sequential Cr2O3 scale forms at the inner layer, and the outer NiO scale could effectively retard the volatilization of the inner Cr2O3 scale; the voids are formed at the scale/alloy interface and inner oxidation of Al element is observed at the same time.

AB Multilayered MCrAlY type coatings have the potential to be optimised to protect superalloy components against both corrosion and oxidation simultaneously. In this paper, a dual layered coating (NiCr(Co)AlY on top of a NiCoCrAlY coating) has been aged and the microstructural evolution has been observed and quantified using various electron microscopy based techniques. In addition, the microstructural evolution of the coating has been modelled using a diffusion based model capable of predicting the ageing of multilayer coatings. It is demonstrated that the model is reasonably accurate in predicting both the phase and chemical distributions through the coating system during ageing, and therefore has the potential to be used as a design tool for the improvement of future layered coating systems.

These parameters predict the occurrence of yield anomaly, but only for a limited range of compositions. The driving force for cross-slip resulting in sessile dislocation configurations and cube slip is lower in Co3AlxW1-x than Ni3Al due to the less-pronounced anisotropy between antiphase boundary energies on the cube and octahedral planes. Yield anomaly is expected at higher temperatures in Co3AlxW1-x because of the higher activation energy resulting from the higher shear modulus. (C) 2016 Acta Materialia Inc.

We fabricated several alloys with hardness 10% higher than the best value in the original training dataset via only seven experiments. We find that a strategy using both the compositions and descriptors based on a knowledge of the properties of HEAs, outperforms that merely based on the compositions alone. This strategy offers a recipe to rapidly optimize multi-component systems, such as bulk metallic glasses and superalloys, towards desired properties. (C) 2019 Acta Materialia Inc.

TI Interfacial characteristics for active brazing of alumina to superalloys
SO JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB The brazing of alumina to Ni-base superalloy (Inconel 600) and Co-base superalloy (UMCo-50) has been studied. The Ag-Cu-Ti active filler metals with Ti-contents of 2 wt% and 8% wt% were employed in this study. However, experiments showed that the Ag-Cu-2 wt% Ti resulted in poor bonding, which was not suitable for the brazing. With an increase of the Ti-content to 8 wt%, whey could be bonded. However, the bonding strengths were still too low. The four-point bending strengths in this case were only 43-54 MPa. An improvement of the bending strength was achieved by inserting a Kovar interlayer. In this case, the bending strength was dramatically increased to 240 MPa and 226 MPa for alumina/UMCo-50 joint and alumina/Inconel 600 joint, respectively.

TI Homogenization heat treatment and segregation analysis of equiaxed
   CMSX-4 superalloy for gas turbine components
SO JOURNAL OF THERMAL ANALYSIS AND CALORIMETRY
AB Homogenization heat treatment and segregation analysis of equiaxed CMSX-4 nickel-based superalloy were investigated. The researches were focused on studying the influence of a multi-cycle heat treatment on the evolution of CMSX-4 superalloy in terms of microstructure and porosity. The heat treatment temperature was selected based on the chemical composition of superalloy and thermodynamic calculations of solidification path and phase formation using a thermodynamic software. Elemental partition coefficients were calculated using the local chemical compositions in different areas of the samples, before and after each heat treatment cycle. It was observed that Al, Ti and Ta segregate in the interdendritic regions and eutectic gamma-gamma' pools, while W, Re and Co segregate mainly in the dendrite cores and the dendrite arms. The compositional analysis shows an increase in the structure homogeneity after the heat treatment, but a certain compositional gradient between the dendrite cores and the interdendritic regions is still observed. The qualitative analysis based on the backscattered electron images sustains the results obtained from the compositional analysis regarding the homogenization of the alloy. A descending evolution of the cuboidal gamma' phase was observed until 6 h of holding, but after 9 h of holding at 1573 K the size of cuboidal gamma' phase starts to grow especially in the interdendritic regions. After long temperature holding time, a notable increase in porosity level was observed due to the partition coefficients of the alloying elements and dissolution of the residual phases (eutectic gamma-gamma' pools, coarse gamma').

TI Corrosion behavior of welded Ni-Co-Cr-Si alloys during exposure in
   integrated coal gasification combined cycle syngas plants
SO MATERIALS TESTING
AB The corrosion behavior of commercially available and welded Haynes (R) 160 (R) Ni-Co-Cr-Si alloy samples was investigated by exposure to coal-gasifying integrated coal gasification combined cycle pilot plant facilities under typical conditions as 2.005 MPa and 160 to 300 degrees C. The morphological and microstructural analyses of the exposed samples were conducted using scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis on the external surface of the recovered corrosion test samples to obtain information of the corrosion scale. These analyses based on the pre- and post-exposure corrosion test samples combined with thermodynamic Ellingham-Pourbaix stability diagrams provided preliminary insight into the mechanism of the observed corrosion behavior prevailing in the piping materials that connected the particulate removal unit and the water scrubber of the integrated coal gasification combined cycle pilot plant. Uniform material wastage was observed after 46 hours of operation, and a preliminary corrosion mechanism was suggested: the observed material waste and corrosion behavior of the Haynes (R) 160 (R) Ni-Co-Cr-Si alloy samples cut off from the coal syngas integrated coal gasification combined cycle plant were explained by the formation of discontinuous (complex) oxide phases and subsequent chlorine-induced active oxidation under the predominantly reducing environment encountered. This contribution supplements the already published studies of Haynes (R) 556 (R) Fe-Ni-Cr-Co alloys and Haynes (R) 230 (R) nickel-based superalloys and completes the comprehensive series of such coal-gasifying integrated coal gasification combined cycle pilot plant exposure tests using the facilities affiliated with the Institute for Advanced Engineering.

TI EFFECTS OF ALLOYING ELEMENTS ON ELASTIC, STACKING FAULT, AND DIFFUSION

SO SUPERALLOYS 2012

CY SEP 09-13, 2012
CL Seven Springs, PA
SP TMS
AB To understand the effects of alloying elements on the creep rate of Ni-base superalloys, factors entering into a secondary creep rate are calculated via first-principles calculations based on density functional theory for 26 Ni31X systems where X = Al, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hf, Ir, Mn, Mo, Nb, Os, Pd, Pt, Re, Rh, Ru, Sc, Si, Ta, Tc, Ti, V, W, Y, Zr, and Zn. They are volume, elastic properties, stacking fault energy, and diffusivity. It is found that shear modulus, Young's modulus, and roughly stacking fault energy show inverse correlation to the atomic volume of the system. In addition, the closer the alloying elements to Ni, with respect to atomic volume and atomic number, the larger the predicted shear modulus, Young's modulus, and stacking fault energy. Diffusivity calculations show that mid-row 5d transition metal elements, particularly Re, Os, and Ir, have the highest activation barrier for diffusion, while far-right or far-left row placement elements such as Y, Zn, and Hf, have the lowest activation energy barriers for diffusion. A creep rate ratio of (epsilon) over dot(Ni31)x/(epsilon) over dot(Ni) is calculated and the effect of the alloying elements shows 13 systems have a decreased creep rate relative to Ni, while 13 systems have an increased creep rate relative to Ni.

TI Co-deposition of aluminide and silicide coatings on gamma-TiAl by pack
   cementation process
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Thermochemical analyses were carried out for a series of pack powder mixtures for deposition of aluminide and for co-deposition of aluminide and silicide coatings on gamma-TiAl by the pack cementation process. Based on the results obtained, experimental studies were undertaken to identify optimum pack powder mixtures for depositing adherent and coherent aluminide and silicide coatings. Pack powder mixtures activated by 2 wt% AlCl3 was used to aluminise gamma-TiAl at 1000degreesC. With proper control of pack compositions and coating conditions, an aluminide coating of TiAl3 with a coherent structure free from microcracking was deposited on the substrate surface via inward diffusion of aluminium. The results of thermochemical calculations indicated that co-deposition of Al and Si is possible with CrCl3.6H(2)O and AlCl3 activated pack powders containing elemental Al and Si as depositing sources. Experimental results obtained at 1100degreesC revealed that CrCl3.6H(2)O is not suitable for use as an activator for co-depositing aluminide and silicide coatings on gamma-TiAl. It caused a significant degree of degradation instead of coating deposition to the substrate. However, adherent coatings with excellent structural integrity consisting of an outer TiSi4 layer and an inner TiAl3 layer were successfully co-deposited at 1100degreesC and 1000degreesC using pack powder mixtures activated by AlCl3. It is suggested that such coatings were formed via a sequential deposition mechanism through inward diffusion of aluminium and silicon. Discussion is presented on the issues that need to be considered to ensure the deposition of aluminide and silicide coatings with coherent structure free from microcracking on gamma-TiAl by the pack cementation process.

AB A high temperature erosion test facility was designed by Tabakoff and Wakeman (Test facility for material erosion at high temperature, ASTM Special Publication 664 (1979) 123-135) to provide erosion data in the range of operating temperatures experienced in compressors and turbines. In addition to the high temperatures, the facility properly simulates all the erosion parameters which were determined to be important from the aerodynamics point of view. These parameters include particle velocity, angle of impact, particle size, particle concentration and sample size. For a better understanding of the use of this tunnel and to obtain good results, definitions of the parameters used in the wind tunnel testings and test procedures are presented: for example, an experimental study which was conducted to investigate the erosion behavior of titanium carbide coating exposed to fly ash and chromite particles. The chemical vapor deposition technique (CVD) was used to apply a ceramic coating on nickel and cobalt based superalloys (M246 and X40). The test specimens were exposed to particle laden flow at velocities of 305 and 366 m s(-1) and temperatures of 550 degrees C and 815 degrees C.

TI Site preferences of alloying transition metal elements in Ni-based
   superalloy: A first-principles study
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB Atomistic characterization of chemical element distribution is crucial to understanding the role of alloying elements for strengthening mechanism of superalloy. In the present work, the site preferences of two alloying elements X-Y in gamma-Ni of Ni-based superalloy are systematically studied using first-principles calculations with and without spin-polarization. The doping elements X and Y are chosen from the 27 kinds of 3d, 4d, 5d group transition metals (Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Cu, Zn, Y, Zr, Nb, Mo, Tc, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, Cd, Hf, Ta, W, Re, Os, Ir, Pt, Au) and Al. We find that the spin-polarized calculations for Re-Re, Re-Ru, Re-Cr, Ru-Cr show a strong chemical binding affinity between the solute elements and are more consistent with the experimental results. The binding energies of pairs between the 28 elements have an obvious periodicity and are closely related the electronic configuration of the elements. When the d-electrons of the element are close to the half full-shell state, two alloying elements possess attractive binding energies, reflecting the effect of the Hund's rule. The combinations of early transition metals (Sc, Ti, V, Y, Zr, Nb, Hf, Ta) have a repulsive interaction in gamma-Ni. These results offer insights into the role of alloying elements for strengthening mechanism of superalloy.

AB Ni-20 wt pct Cr wires, as individual wires or within 3D woven structures, are alloyed with Mo, Al, and Ti by gas-phase surface deposition and volume interdiffusion. Mo deposition creates Mo-rich coating and Kirkendall pores. Al + Ti co-deposition creates uniform triple-layered coating. The resulting homogenized and aged Ni-(17.4-19.6) Cr-(1.6-1.8) Al-(2.5-3.6) Ti-(1.5-4.5) Mo(wt pct) wires exhibit gamma + gamma' superalloy microstructure.

AB The microstructural development in PWA-1480 superalloy electron beam welds (Ni-11.0at%Al-11.5%Cr-1.9%Ti-5.1%Co-4.0%Ta-1.3%W) was characterized. Optical microscopy revealed a branched dendritic structure in the weld metal. Transmission electron microscopy of these welds, in the as-welded condition, showed fine cuboidal (0.05-0.5 mu m) L1(2)-ordered gamma' precipitates within the gamma grains. The average volume percentage of the gamma' precipitates was found to be similar to 75%. Atom probe analyses revealed that the composition of the gamma matrix was Ni-4.6at%Al-25.5%Cr-0.4%Ti-9.4%Co-0.8%Ta-2.9%W and that of the gamma' precipitates was Ni-18.2at%Al-2.6%Cr-2.4%Ti-2.8%Co-7.1%Ta-1.5%W. These compositions were compared with the previous APFIM analyses of commercial PWA-1480 single crystals that had received conventional heat treatments. Small differences were found in the chromium and aluminum levels and these may be due to the nonequilibrium nature of phase transformations that occur during weld cooling. No solute segregation was detected at the gamma-gamma' interface. The APFIM results were also compared with the thermodynamic calculations of alloying element partitioning between the gamma and gamma' phases using the ThermoCalc(TM) program.

TI Cyclic-loading microstructure-property relations from a mesoscale
   perspective: An example of single crystal Nickel-based superalloys
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Past models of stress-strain response under cyclic loading mainly rely on macroscopic equations which consider microstructure evolution indirectly or simply discard microstructure information. Modern materials science, on the other hand, seeks quantitative descriptions for the relations between microstructure and loading response. In the present work, we show a promising mesoscale phase-field framework which can describe co-evolution of phase/grain and defect microstructures, reveal microstructure mechanisms and simultaneously predict deformation properties as a natural outcome of microstrucuture interactions. The energy functionals for phase/grain and defect microstructures are constructed, followed by functional variation which leads to governing equations. Applying the developed framework to high temperature cyclic loading of single crystal Nickel-based superalloys, the simulated results show that cyclic loading-microstructure-property relations can be principally revealed. In the short term perspective (in one cycle), dislocations move back and forth, leading to cyclic loops consistent with characteristics observed in experiments. The plastic strains are one order of magnitude smaller than total strains, which explains why the cyclic loops are very "thin". In the long term perspective, all gamma/gamma' microstructures exhibit directional coarsening similar to creep under zero cyclic loading ratio, with the extent of rafting slightly dependents on cyclic waveform, period, etc. The plastic strains are sensitive to cyclic loading conditions both in terms of curve shape and in terms of magnitude.

TI Interdiffusion behavior of Ni-Cr-Al-Y coatings deposited by arc-ion
   plating
SO OXIDATION OF METALS
AB Ni-Cr-Al-P coatings were deposited on the Ni3Al-base superalloys IC-6 and K17 by are-ion plating. The results indicated that a small amount of substrate atoms, such as Co, Ti, Mo, etc., existed in the Ni-Cr-Al-Y coatings near the substrates, probably due to "sputter" and "antisputter." For the alloy K17, the impeding effect of Al was not obvious, because the temperatures of the substrate and the coating were high (420-480 degreesC) during the deposition process and interdiffusion was accelerated. However, for alloy IC-6 which contains Al, as well as a high concentration of Mo, the diffusion of Cr was impeded. Vacuum heat treatment at 1050 degreesC drastically increased diffusivities and the presence of Al and Mo was not enough to prevent some Cr diffusion. Thus, the coating became mor e uniform and close to the desired composition.

TI Improved High-Temperature Microstructural Stability and Creep Property
   of Novel Co-Base Single-Crystal Alloys Containing Ta and Ti
SO JOM
AB The influence of Ta and Ti additions on microstructural stability and creep behavior in novel Co-Al-W base single-crystal alloys has been investigated. Compared to the ternary alloy, the gamma' solvus temperature and gamma' volume fraction were raised by individual additions of Ta and Ti, and increased further in the quinary alloy containing both alloying additions. In contrast to ternary and quaternary alloys, an improved microstructural stability with the stable gamma-gamma' two-phase microstructure and more than 60% gamma' volume fraction existed in the quinary alloy after prolonged aging treatment at 1050 degrees C for 1000 h. The creep behavior at 900 degrees C revealed lower creep rates and longer rupture lives in the quaternary alloys compared to the ternary alloy, whereas the quinary alloy exhibited even better creep resistance. When the creep temperature was elevated to about 1000 degrees C, the creep resistance of the quinary alloy exceeded the previously reported Co-Al-W-base alloys and first-generation Ni-base single-crystal superalloys. The improved creep resistance at approximately 1000 degrees C was considered to be associated with high gamma' volume fraction, gamma' directional coarsening, and dislocation substructure, which included gamma-gamma' interfacial dislocation networks and the sheared gamma' precipitates containing stacking faults and anti-phase boundaries.

TI Laser-assisted processing of Ni-Al-Co-Ti under high pressure
SO MATERIALS AND MANUFACTURING PROCESSES
AB Laser-assisted processing and in-situ characterization of a Ni-0.7-Al-0.1235-Co-0.15-Ti-0.0265 alloy were carried out under a range of simultaneous hydrostatic high pressures of similar to 30GPa and high temperature conditions similar to 2000 degrees C using a laser-assisted heating in diamond anvil cell with synchrotron X-ray micro-diffraction. The characterization of the microstructure and X-ray diffraction analysis at ambient conditions confirmed the formation of the cuboids of ordered phase in the disordered matrix. The isothermal bulk modulus (B-0) and its first-order derivative (B-0') of the alloy were determined to be B-0 = 123 +/- 9 GPa and B-0' = 5.7 +/- 2.8. The in-situ characterization of the alloy at high temperatures under high pressures revealed that the phase transforms into the tetragonaly distorted D0(22)-type structure. This transformation is similar to the transformation that occurs in the ordered Ni3Al, responsible for the improved strength at high temperatures. High pressure was found to increase the onset temperature of the structural distortion. The pressure-temperature phase diagram of the Ni-0.7-Al-0.1235-Co-0.15-Ti-0.0265 up to similar to 30GPa and similar to 2000 degrees C was determined and is reported here.

TI Interfacial reactions of a MAX phase/superalloy hybrid
SO SURFACE AND INTERFACE ANALYSIS
AB Oxidation resistant, strain tolerant MAX phase coatings are of general interest for high temperature applications. Accordingly, Cr2AlC MAX phase coupons were vacuum diffusion bonded to an advanced turbine disk alloy at 1100 degrees C for compatibility studies. The interface revealed an inner diffusion zone consisting of similar to 10 mu m of -Ni(Co)Al, decorated with various (Ni,Co)(3)Al, Ta(Ti,Nb)C, and W(Cr,Mo)(3)B-2 precipitates. On the Cr2AlC side, an additional similar to 40-mu m Al-depletion zone of Cr7C3 formed an interconnected network with the -Ni(Co)Al. On the superalloy side, enhanced carbide precipitation developed over a depth of similar to 80 mu m. Subsequent annealing for 100h and 1000h at 800 degrees C coarsened some features, enhanced TCP precipitation in the superalloy, but only enlarged the diffusion layers by similar to 5 mu m at most. Because of Al depletion from the MAX phase and corresponding Al enrichment of the alloy, the reaction zone displayed similarities to an oxidized Cr2AlC surface and an aluminized superalloy, respectively.

TI Multicomponent gamma'-strengthened Co-based superalloys with increased
   solvus temperatures and reduced mass densities
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB Several Co-Al-(W)-based gamma-(FCC)/gamma'-(L1(2)) alloys are investigated to combine recent results indicating significant increases in the gamma'-solvus temperature with additions of Ni, Ta, and Ti, and reduced mass density with the substitution of Mo and Nb for W. A maximum solvus temperature of 1167 +/- 6 degrees C is achieved for an alloy with the composition Co-30Ni-7Al-4Ti-7W-1Ta (mole fraction x 100); while the composition Co-30Ni-7Al-4Ti-3Mo-2W-1Nb-1Ta (L19) exhibits a promising combination of high gamma' volume fraction and solvus temperature, low mass density, and excellent two-phase gamma-gamma'microstructural stability. Atom probe tomographic measurement of L19 aged for 4 hat 900 degrees C indicates that Ni, Al, Ti, W, Nb, and Ta partition preferentially to the gamma'-precipitates while Co partitions strongly to the gamma-matrix. Molybdenum segregates at the gamma/gamma' interface, resulting in a reduction in the interfacial free energy of 1.63 +/- 0.85 mJ m(-2). Decreasing the mole fraction of Ni from 30% to 10% decreases the partitioning of Al and Ti to the gamma'-phase and increases partitioning of Co, Mo, W, Nb, and Ta to the gamma'-phase. From an analysis of coarsening kinetics (Ostwald ripening) at 900 C in Co-xNi-7Al-4Ti-3Mo-2W-1Nb-1Ta (x = 10 and 30) interfacial free energies of 35.0 +/- 18.6 mJ m(-2) and 29.2 +/- 15.5 mJ m(-2) are calculated for mole fractions of Ni of 10% and 30%, respectively. This decrease in interfacial free energy with increasing Ni-concentration is attributed partially to both Mo-segregation at the gamma-gamma' interface and a decrease in the lattice parameter misfit between the gamma'-precipitate and gamma-matrix, and concomitantly the misfit strain energy.

AB In this paper oxidation induced microstructural changes of a Co based bond coat alloy are discussed. Microstructure of Co32Ni21Cr(4-12)Al3ReY was studied at 1000 degrees C and modelled using thermo-calc. The effect of varying aluminum content on precipitating phases was quantified and experimental results were compared with modelled microstructure to access modelling capabilities of thermo-calc. Dictra was used to predict microstructural changes due to Al depletion and the influence of alloy's microstructure on material's properties was also considered. Microstructural changes across oxidized alloy were related to spatially varying alloy's hardness. Experimental findings proved thermodynamic modelling and kinetic simulations produced excellent qualitative and quantitative phase information to represent the system under oxidation at high temperature.

TI Effects of test conditions on the tribological behaviour of a journal
   bearing in molten zinc
SO WEAR
AB Wear of journal bearings, consisting of cobalt-based Tribaloy T-800 bushings and carbide-coated 316L stainless steel (316L SS) sleeves, was evaluated in a molten zinc-aluminum alloy at different speeds and loads. It was found that these bearings experienced much less wear in comparison with the commonly used Stellite 6 bearings under similar conditions. There appeared to be a threshold load level of about 6.7 kN, below which both the friction and wear of the bearings were low. With the load maintained at a constant level, an increase in the test speed resulted in lower friction and lesser wear. The worn surfaces of both bushings and sleeves were relatively smooth without the appearance of wear grooves. Thorough analyses of the tested samples revealed that both materials have a lesser tendency to react with molten zinc. The binder phases of the carbide coating, however, did react with the test bath. Cracking of the test materials near the contact surfaces indicated that surface fatigue wear was the major wear mechanism affecting the journal bearing sliding in molten zinc. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

TI Energy analysis with a superspherical shape approximation on the
   spherical to cubical shape transitions of coherent precipitates in cubic
   materials
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB Energy consideration is made to discuss the spherical to cubical shape transitions of coherent precipitates in cubic materials. A superspherical shape approximation is adopted to describe intermediate shapes of the precipitates between a sphere and a cube. The elastic strain energy due to the misfit precipitates is evaluated by solving three-dimensional inclusion problems of cubic materials for superspherical inclusions with uniform eigenstrains. One of the advantages of the present analysis is that the shape transitions of the precipitates from spherical to cubical can be discussed with simple analysis using a parameter describing the cubic character of precipitates. The present theoretical results well explain the previous experimental results on the shape transitions of precipitates for Ni-Ni3Al and Cu-Co-Cr alloys. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

TI Modeling gas turbine materials' hot corrosion degradation in combustion
   environments from H-2-rich syngas
SO MATERIALS AND CORROSION-WERKSTOFFE UND KORROSION
AB Components of gas turbines (such as blades, vanes, combustor cans) exposed to combustion environments at high temperature are susceptible to hot corrosion attack. To successfully plan maintenance and to determine whether to operate in novel combustion modes (e.g., in integrated gasification combined cycles that incorporate pre-combustion carbon capture) predictions of hot corrosion component life must be made. In this paper, hot corrosion datasets relating to two alloys, MarM 509 (a cobalt-based superalloy), and Rene 80 (a nickel-based superalloy) form the basis of hot corrosion predictive lifetime models. The model framework is based on the two stages of incubation and propagation, with the transitions from incubation to propagation around the samples being based on Weibull statistics. The impact of a range of temperatures (including 700 and 900 degrees C), gas compositions (simulating the combustion of natural gas, H-2-rich syngas, or partially cleaned syngas), and deposit chemistries/fluxes have been assessed. Predictions have been made including the expected damage spread for a range of different exposure conditions.

SO ADVANCED ENGINEERING MATERIALS
AB This paper describes a through-process modelling on a microstructural level of the production of a coated turbine blade, including its in-service properties and degradation, accompanied by the actual production and testing of a CMSX-4 single crystal turbine blade dummy. The following steps are dealt with by modelling and experiment: solidification of the blade alloy during casting, microstructural changes during homogenization and aging heat treatments, chemical vapour deposition of an Al(2)O(3) diffusion barrier coating, physical vapour deposition (sputtering) of a (Ni,Co)CrAlY bond coat, atmospheric plasma spraying of an Y(2)O(3) stabilized ZrO(2) thermal barrier coating and microstructural changes and development of critical stresses at in-service conditions. This work forms a part of the Collaborative Research Centre 370 (SFB370) "Integrative materials modelling".

SP Int Gas Turbine Inst
AB Additive manufacturing (AM) via the direct metal laser sintering (DMLS) route is a new technology for both new make and repair application in gas turbine hot gas path components. This paper presents the development of a new oxidation coating Ceral 10 as a protective coating on the AM CoCrMo alloys. A high Al activity slurry aluminide coating (Ceral 10) was deposited on the DMLS CoCrMo. The coating produced on DMLS CoCrMo was uniform and intact having a thickness of similar to 80-100 mu m. The slurry aluminide coating showed an Inward diffusion with the DMLS CoCrMo substrate having an Al of 38-40 wt% and Si (12-13 wt%) after the diffusion heat treatment. The interface with the substrate was gradual in terms of chemistry with an interdiffusion zone of 15-20 mu m. The Ceral 10 coating showed limited oxidation up to 1038 degrees C (1000 h) and at 1066 degrees C (after 500 h), coating spallation occurred. The distinct thermally grown oxide between the coating-substrate interface led to the spallation. The effectiveness of the Ceral 10 coating to protect the DMLS CoCrMo alloy at high temperatures is evaluated via detailed microstructural characterization.

SO SCRIPTA MATERIALIA
AB The effect of phosphorous on the microstructure of a powder-processed, high Nb-content, Ni-based superalloy was studied and compared to a P-free variant. The P-doped sample had a lower incipient melting temperature, forming a (Ni, Co, Cr, P)(2)(Nb, Mo) laves phase along the grain boundaries. Transmission electron microscopy and atom probe tomography were used to identify the crystal structure, assess phase compositions, and determine any elemental segregation to phase boundaries. The results revealed strong partitioning of P to the laves phase and a slight Mo gradient towards the phrase. Finally, a simplified laves phase was successfully modeled via density functional theory calculations. (C) 2018 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI MICROSTRUCTURE AND RESISTANCE TO CRACKING OF MODIFIED AL-SI AND AL-CR
   DIFFUSION COATINGS ON ZS6K NICKEL-BASED SUPERALLOYS
SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB The subject of the investigations was a superalloy with the following chemical composition: 0.14 wt.% C, 10.2 wt.% Cr, 5.3 wt.% Al, 2.8 wt.% Ti, 3.7 wt.% Mo, 5.2 wt.% W, 4.7 wt.% Co, 1.5 wt.% Fe and the balance nickel. A pack cementation technique of coating was applied. Acoustic emission signals were recorded as a function of specimen elongation (SIGMAN-epsilon). The values of elongation (epsilon0) at the moment of the first crack appearance and at the beginning of rapid fracture were measured.
   The crack resistances of the aluminide, silicoaluminide and chromoaluminide diffusion coatings were the main subject of the studies performed. If we take the co parameter as a crack resistance criterion it was found that, when compared with the aluminide coatings, Al-Si and Al-Cr coatings are less resistant. The crack morphologies of aluminium and Al-Cr coatings were similar in character. Among the typical features were cracks that did not spread through the entire layer thickness and discontinuous cracks with branches. In the depleted zone of the coatings, cracks developed along the NiAl phase grain boundaries.

The investigation has been performed for the superalloy after standard heat treatment and the ex-service CMSX-4 turbine blade after operation for 12 700 hours and 200 starts in industrial gas turbine. The results have shown that Co, Cr and Re partition to the gamma matrix, Ni and W are present in both gamma and gamma' phases, while Al, Ti and Ta strongly partition to the gamma' phase. The results show the abilities of new analytical electron microscopy and electron tomography methods to characterize the microstructure and chemical composition of single crystal superalloys at the nanoscale.

TI Failure analysis of monel packing in atmospheric distillation tower
   under the service in the presence of corrosive gases
SO ENGINEERING FAILURE ANALYSIS
AB We have performed a failure analysis on a monel packing material subjected to sulfidation and sulfide stress cracking after a short period of service in an atmospheric distillation tower containing corrosive gases. Optical macroscopic inspections show that the failed packing material was basically covered with dark scales and corrosion products. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction spectrum show that the corrosion products contain sulfur as the main element along with oxygen indicating that oxidation may have been taken place beside sulfidation. Metallography of the failed samples reveals that cracks exist and were initiated on the surface from defects most likely developed due to the formation of porous and brittle sulfide layer accomplished by hydrogen embrittlement. Although nickel base alloys are an appropriate candidate owing to their high corrosion resistant in corrosive atmospheres, however, presence of H2S, HCl, O-2 and naphthenic acid in crude oil lead to reduction in corrosion resistant of the monel 400 alloy.

AB High-velocity oxy-fuel (HVOF) has the advantage of being a continuous and most convenient process for applying coatings to industrial installations at site. In this study, Cr3C2-NiCr, NiCrBSi, Stellite-6 and Ni-20Cr coatings were deposited on a Ni-based superalloy (19.5Cr-3Fe-0.3Ti-0.1C-balance Ni) using an HVOF process. Hot corrosion studies were performed on bare as well as coated superalloy specimens after exposure to a molten salt environment at 900 degrees C under cyclic conditions. The thermogravimetric technique was used to establish the kinetics of corrosion. XRD, SEM/EDAX and EPMA techniques were used to analyse the corrosion products. The hot corrosion resistance of all the coatings were superior to bare superalloy. Among the coatings studied, the Ni-20Cr coated superalloy imparted maximum hot corrosion resistance, whereas the Stellite-6 coated indicated minimum resistance. The hot corrosion resistance of all coatings may be attributed to the formation of oxides and spinels of nickel,,chromium or cobalt. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The high temperature corrosion behavior of N07263, N06600, and N06625 in LiCl-Li2O molten salt was investigated at temperatures ranging from 650 to 850 A degrees C in a glove box. The high temperature corrosion behavior was observed using measurements of the oxide morphology and thickness, the extent of internal corrosion, and the compositional changes in the scale and in the substrate. Corrosion tests were performed, and these demonstrated that the main corrosion products were Fe(Ni,Co)(3), FeNi3, and LiCrO2. The internal corrosion of N07263 was localized, while that of N06600 maintained intergranular corrosion throughout the test temperature range. N06625 exhibited uniform intergranular corrosion behaviors at low and high temperatures. N07263 exhibited superior corrosion resistance, as evidenced by its corrosion layer which was more continuous, dense, and adherent when compared with those of N06600 and N06625.

TI Effect of heat treatment on mechanical properties of alloy 909
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Alloy 909 is a Ni-Fe-Co alloy that exhibits a low coefficient of thermal expansion and high strength at elevated temperatures. These characteristics are suitable for demanding high temperature uses such as turbine components for aerospace and energy generation. The mechanical properties are achieved by heat treatment (solution and aging) that affects the microstructural characteristics such as grain size and precipitation of intergranular and transgranular particles. This work summarises the results of trials conducted to determine the conditions that assure the desired mechanical properties in high temperature ring rolled pieces. Results of tensile, hardness and stress rupture tests are complemented by microstructural analyses. These studies allowed for establishing a robust method for the manufacture of rings; no degradation of the product, either metallurgical or due to properties, has been reported after the method was implemented.

TI Direct materials deposition: designed macro and microstructure
SO MATERIALS RESEARCH INNOVATIONS
AB Solid freeform fabrication of engineering materials is now possible using the Direct Metal Deposition (DMD) technique. Closed loop optical feedback system for DMD makes realistic components with dimensional accuracy of 0.01 inch. On the other hand, close control of the process parameter can provide microstructure of choice. Such continued capability to control macro and microstructure is creating considerable interest. H13 tool steel is one of the difficult alloys for deposition due to residual stress accumulation from martensitic transformation. However, it is the material of choice for the die and tool industry. DMD offers Copper chill blocks and water cooling channels as the integral part of the tool. On the other hand ZrO(2) was co-deposited with nickel superalloys using DMD. This process thus is amenable to produce both macro and microstructure to a designed specification. This paper briefly reviews the state of the art of DMD and describes the microstructure and mechanical properties of selected engineering alloy systems deposited by DMD.

   interfaces in a Ni-based superalloy

CL HAIFA, ISRAEL
AB The investigation of microstructure and chemical composition of the gamma and gamma' phases were performed in a Ni-base superalloy by means of analytical electron microscopy. The distribution of particular elements in the alloy was revealed using X-ray mapping in a transmission electron microscope. The detected concentration profiles of alloying elements at the gamma'/gamma interface were relatively sharp in the case of cuboidal shape of the gamma' phase while they resembled the classical diffusion profile for the oval gamma' phase. The quantitative analysis of the gamma' phase revealed much higher content of Al and lower of Ti, W, Co and Mo in the oval precipitates compared to cuboidal ones. This result is attributed to the different solidification paths, which is eutectic for the cuboidal gamma' precipitates and peritectic for the oval gamma' precipitates.

TI Alumina formation and microstructural changes of aluminized CoNiCrAlY
   coating during high temperature exposure in the temperature range 925
   degrees C-1075 degrees C
SO MATERIALS AT HIGH TEMPERATURES
AB MCrAlY (M = Ni, Co) coatings are commonly used on gas-turbine components as oxidation resistant overlay coatings and bondcoats for thermal barrier systems. In the present work the microstructural features and oxidation behavior of an aluminized Co-base MCrAlY-coating on a Ni-based superalloy have been investigated in the temperature range 925-1075 degrees C. Microstructural studies of the oxidized coatings by SEM/EBSD were complemented with numerical thermodynamic calculations using the software package ThermoCalc. In the as-received condition the outer part of the coating consisted mostly of beta-(Ni,Co)Al. Formation of sigma-CoCr was observed at the interface between the beta-layer and the inner initial CoNiCrAlY. During high-temperature air exposure alumina based surface scales were formed but the oxidation induced Al depletion of the aluminized coating did not result in formation of the gamma'-(Ni3Al) phase. Rather, the subscale formation of Co/Cr-rich phases was observed and a direct transformation of beta- into gamma-Ni phase after longer times. It is expected that these subscale microstructural changes thus affect the alumina formation and growth as well as the critical aluminum depletion in a different manner as in the case of corresponding beta-NiAl coatings, although a direct comparison between various coating systems was not possible on the basis of the present results.

TI On the Path to Optimizing the Al-Co-Cr-Cu-Fe-Ni-Ti High Entropy Alloy
   Family for High Temperature Applications
SO ENTROPY
AB The most commonly investigated high entropy alloy, AlCoCrCuFeNi, has been chosen for optimization of its microstructural and mechanical properties by means of compositional changes and heat treatments. Among the different available optimization paths, the decrease of segregating element Cu, the increase of oxidation protective elements Al and Cr and the approach towards a gamma-gamma' microstructure like in Ni-based superalloys have been probed and compared. Microscopical observations have been made for every optimization step. Vickers microhardness measurements and/or tensile/compression test have been carried out when the alloy was appropriate. Five derived alloys AlCoCrFeNi, Al23Co15Cr23Cu8Fe15Ni16, Al8Co17Cr17Cu8Fe17Ni33, Al8Co17Cr14Cu8Fe17Ni34.8Mo0.1Ti1W0.1 and Al10Co25Cr8Fe15Ni36Ti6 (all at.%) have been compared to the original AlCoCrCuFeNi and the most promising one has been selected for further investigation.

TI Preparation and oxidation of an Al2O3-modified aluminide coating
SO VACUUM
AB An Al2O3-modified aluminide coating was produced by aluminizing an as-electrodeposited Ni-Al2O3 nanocomposite film using pack cementation method at 1100 C for 4 h. For comparison, aluminizing was also performed in the same condition on an as-deposited Ni film without Al2O3 nanoparticles. SEM/EDAX and TEM results indicated that the co-deposited Al2O3 nanoparticles were homogeneously dispersed in the finer-grain nanocrystalline Ni grains. The isothermal and cyclic oxidation in air at 900 degrees C indicated that the Al2O3-modified aluminide coatings were profoundly oxidation resistant as compared to the Al2O3-free aluminide coatings due to the faster formation of a continuous adherent alpha-Al2O3 scale. The effect of Al2O3 on the microstructure and the oxidation of the aluminide coating are discussed in the detail. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI First-principles theoretical and experimental studies of effects of
   ruthenium on precipitation behavior of mu phase and mu/matrix interface
   stability in Ni-based single crystal superalloys
SO INTERMETALLICS
AB Precipitation of deleterious topologically close-packed (TCP) phases worsens the mechanical behavior of Ni-based single crystal superalloys. It is acknowledged that Ru will inhibit precipitation of TCP phase. In this paper, precipitation behaviors of TCP in alloy with and without Ru have been investigated through experimental characterization means, combined with the first principles calculations. For the first time, the interface structure between precipitated mu phase and matrix gamma phase has been established, and stable interfacial termination types in different orientation relationships were obtained. Effects of solute atoms like Ru on interface stability and site substitution behaviors of different solute elements in two phases were further calculated, and compared with precipitation behavior and composition information of TCP phases in two alloys. It is verified that Ru is different with other elements, which can remarkably increase the interfacial energy of mu/gamma interface, decrease interface stability, and rise the difficulty of nucleation of mu phase; conversely, W will lower the interfacial energy of mu/gamma, making it easier for mu phase to nucleate; the effects of Co and Cr are not that obvious; the effects of Re and Mo on interfacial energy and nucleation of mu phase vary with orientation relationships. Also, Re, Cr, and Ru have larger trends to diffuse from matrix gamma to mu phase during growing process of mu phase. The above reasons give rise to blocking effect of Ru on the nucleation of TCP phase, but Ru has trifling influence on inhibition of precipitation growth.

TI Effects of alloying elements and temperature on the elastic properties
   of dilute Ni-base superalloys from first-principles calculations
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB The variation of elastic properties, e. g., elastic constants, bulk modulus, and shear modulus of dilute Ni-base superalloys due to alloying elements (X's) and temperature, has been studied via first-principles calculations. Here, 26 alloying elements are considered: Al, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hf, Ir, Mn, Mo, Nb, Os, Pd, Pt, Re, Rh, Ru, Sc, Si, Ta, Tc, Ti, V, W, Y, Zn, and Zr. It is found that (i) both the bulk and shear moduli of Ni-X decrease approximately linearly with increasing equilibrium volume, especially within each group of 3d, 4d, or 5d transition-metal alloying elements; (ii) all alloying elements considered herein increase the ratio of bulk to shear modulus (i. e., the ductility) and the elastic anisotropy of the Ni-X alloys; and (iii) the largest decrease of elastic properties of Ni is caused by alloying element Y. It is observed that the change of elastic properties of Ni due to various alloying elements is traceable from the distribution of (magnetization) charge density, for instance the spherical distribution of charge density facilitates shear deformation, resulting in a lower shear-related property. Using a proposed quasistatic approach based on the predicted elasticity-volume-temperature relationship, the isothermal and the isentropic elastic properties are predicted for the dilute Ni-X alloys at finite temperatures, displaying a decreasing trend with respect to temperature for each Ni-X system. Computed elastic properties are in favorable accord with available experimental data. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics. [http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4749406]

TI Accounting for lattice coherency in a two-phase elastic-plastic
   self-consistent model for nickel-based superalloys
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLASTICITY
AB A 2-site elastic-plastic self-consistent (EPSC) model is developed and implemented in order to account for crystallographic texture development and grain morphology evolution under strong correlations between neighbor grains of different phases, both in space and orientation. Predictions of the model adequately fit the published in situ neutron diffraction data for nickel-based superalloys at ambient and elevated temperatures, in which gamma and gamma' phases exhibit exact cube-cube orientation relationship. Comparison with 2-site model (small strain algorithm, nonrotation scheme) and 1-site model (finite strain algorithm, co-rotation scheme) has been made, and the result shows that the present 2-site model (finite strain algorithm, rotation scheme) leads to better predictions in lattice strain evolution where both rotation of crystal lattice and correlation between inclusions are accounted for, especially when the applied strain is larger than 0.02 for transverse direction and 0.05 similar to 0.18 for axial direction for the materials studied in this work. Based on a systematic study on the effects of grain-grain interaction and total grain number on the homogenized results, we found that transverse lattice strains of gamma (200) and/or gamma' (100) are sensitive to the interplay between gamma-gamma' interaction and evolution of grain orientation distribution with deformation, while that of gamma (220) and gamma' (110) are sensitive to the initial crystallographic texture.

   superalloys. Part I. Characterization and comparison of isothermal
   oxidation behavior at 1100 degrees C with a NiCrAlY coating
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB A microcrystalline beta-NiAl coating was prepared on a single-crystal (SC) superalloy substrate via magnetron sputtering and subsequent vacuum annealing. The grain sizes of the coating ranged from about 300 nm to 1 mu m. A reference NiCrAlY coating, which was mainly comprised of gamma'-Ni3Al and alpha-Cr, was prepared by means of vacuum arc evaporation (VAE). Isothermal oxidation tests were carried out at 1100 degrees C in air for 50 h. Both coatings formed thin and adherent alpha-Al2O3 scales during tests, while the oxide scales on the bare superalloy primarily consisted of spinel (Ni,Co)Al2O4 with underlying alpha-Al2O3 scale. The parabolic rate constant of the NiAl-coated specimens was about one order of magnitude lower than that of the NiCrAlY coated specimens. After oxidation tests, only a small amount of gamma' phase was detected at some columnar boundaries of the beta-NiAl coating, and about 2/3 parts of the NiCrAlY coating transformed into gamma phase which resolved the alpha-Cr precipitations, while an Al-depleted zone in thickness of about 10 mu m formed beneath the TGO of the bare superalloy. Inter-diffusion zones and secondary reaction zones were observed on the specimens coated by either beta-NiAl or NiCrAlY. The oxidation mechanism and microstructure evolvement of the specimens during high temperature exposures were discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Deposition of silicon modified aluminide coatings on nickel base
   superalloys by pack cementation process
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The equilibrium partial pressures of vapour species generated in halide activated pack powder mixtures at high temperatures were calculated for a series of compositions using thermochemical analysis tools. The results obtained were applied to identify suitable activators and pack compositions for codepositing Al and Si to form diffusion coatings on nickel base superalloys by the pack cementation process. The calculation results suggested that compositions of the pack powder mixtures activated by CrCl(3.)6H(2)O may be adjusted to create deposition conditions favourable for codepositing Al and Si, but, those activated by AlF3 or AlCl3 may only deposit Al. A series of coating deposition experiments were also carried out at 1000degreesC and 1100degreesC and the results obtained confirmed that, with adequate control of pack compositions and deposition conditions, codeposition of Al and Si can be achieved with CrCl(3.)6H(2)O activated pack powder mixtures. A mixture of elemental Al and Si powders may be used as a depositing source instead of using Al - Si master alloy powders as conventionally recommended. The coatings could be formed either through the inward diffusions of Al and Si or through the outward diffusion of Ni together with other substrate elements such as Cr and Co, depending on the deposition temperature used. Prolonged deposition at 1100degreesC led to the formation of a coating with a multilayered structure consisting of an outer nickel silicide layer and a middle Si modified NiAl layer followed by a diffusion zone. The pack compositions and deposition conditions may be adjusted to control the microstructure of the coatings formed by the codeposition process. (C) 2003 Iom Communications Ltd.

TI Insight into gamma-Ni/gamma '-Ni3Al interfacial energy affected by
   alloying elements
SO MATERIALS & DESIGN
AB Interfacial energy (sigma(gamma/gamma ')) of the gamma-Ni/gamma '-Ni3Al interface is critical to understand and design Ni-based superalloys. In the present work, a first-principles methodology with constrained relaxations has been used to study the effect of dilute alloying element (X) on sigma(gamma/gamma ') of the (100) coherent interface, where the sixteen X's include Al, Co, Cr, Fe, Hf, Mo, Nb, Pd, Pt, Re, Ru, Ta, Ti, W, Y, and Zr. sigma(gamma/gamma) = 19mJ/m(2) has been predicted for the unalloyed gamma/gamma ' interface, agreeing well with the previous estimations. It is found that the sigma(gamma/gamma) value is the lowest when alloying element is in gamma-Ni, while the addition to gamma '-Ni3Al increases sigma(gamma/gamma) due mainly to the in-plane lattice expansion. Specifically, our calculations show that alloying elements Mo, W, and Re have the largest effect on the sigma(gamma/gamma) value by decreasing it to 4-5 mJ/m(2) when partitioned to gamma-Ni; Ru and Pt are shown to increase greatly the sigma(gamma/gamma) value up to 2528 mJ/m(2) when partitioned to gamma-Ni; all ternary additions substituting for Ni in gamma '-Ni3Al increase sigma(gamma/gamma) except for Pt; and for Ti and Ta, which segregate strongly to gamma '-Ni3Al and substitute for Al, the sigma(gamma/gamma) values increase to 32 and 35 mJ/m2, respectively.

TI Effect of doping Mg on the microstructure and mechanical behaviours of a
   novel Co-9Al-4.5W-4.5Mo-2Ta-0.02B alloy at room- and high-temperatures
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB The microstructure and mechanical behaviour of a novel magnesium (Mg) doped Co-9Al-4.5W-4.5Mo-2Ta-0.02B alloy (doped 0.1, 0.3, 0.7 and 1.0 at.% Mg, referred to as 0.1Mg, 0.3Mg, 0.7Mg and 1Mg alloys hereafter, respectively) at room-and high-temperatures have been investigated. All alloys aged at 800 degrees C for 50 h consist of a Co solid-solution matrix (gamma-Co-ss) and nano-scale cuboidal gamma'-Co-3(Al, W) precipitates. Mg is observed to segregate primarily at the grain boundaries and the gamma'-Co-3(Al, W) phase. In the 0.7Mg and 1Mg alloys more Mg segregation at the grain boundaries decreases the fraction of Sigma 1 similar to 3 type grain boundaries and the capability of excluding impurity O from the grain boundaries. With decreased Sigma 1 similar to 3 boundaries and higher O content, the 0.7Mg and 1Mg alloys fracture in a mixed transgranular-intergranular mode at room temperature with lower strength and ductility under tension. However, the 0.1 and 0.3Mg alloys fracture in a transgranular mode with higher strength and ductility. The four alloys exhibit compressive flow stress anomalies at 700 degrees C and the strength obviously decreases when the nominal Mg contents increase to 0.7-1 at.% at 600-800 degrees C. As for the 0.1Mg and 0.3Mg alloys, the strengths from room temperature to 800 degrees C are higher and not obviously affected by the nominal Mg contents, primarily owing to the two alloys having almost the same and higher Sigma 1 similar to 3 grain boundary fraction and the lower O concentration in the grain boundary.

TI Topologically close-packed phases in binary transition-metal compounds:
   matching high-throughput ab initio calculations to an empirical
   structure map
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB In steels and single-crystal superalloys the control of the formation of topologically close-packed (TCP) phases is critical for the performance of the material. The structural stability of TCP phases in multi-component transition-metal alloys may be rationalized in terms of the average valence-electron count (N) over bar and the composition-dependent relative volume-difference Delta(V) over bar / (V) over bar We elucidate the interplay of these factors by comparing density-functional theory calculations to an empirical structure map based on experimental data. In particular, we calculate the heat of formation for the TCP phases A15, C14, C15, C36, x, mu and sigma for all possible binary occupations of the Wyckoff positions. We discuss the isovalent systems V/Nb-Ta to highlight the role of atomic-size difference and observe the expected stabilization of C14/C15/C36/mu by Delta(V) over bar / (V) over bar at Delta N = 0 in V-Ta. In the systems V/Nb-Re, we focus on the well-known trend of A15 -> sigma -> x stability with increasing (N) over bar and show that the influence of Delta(V) over bar / (V) over bar is too weak to stabilize C14/C15/C36/mu in Nb-Re. As an example for a significant influence of both (N) over bar and Delta(V) over bar / (V) over bar, we also consider the systems Cr/Mo-Co. Here the sequence A15 ->sigma -> x is observed in both systems but in Mo-Co the large size-mismatch stabilizes C14/C15/C36/mu. We also include V/Nb-Co that cover the entire valence range of TCP stability and also show the stabilization of C14/C15/C36/mu. Moreover, the combination of a large volume-difference with a large mismatch in valence-electron count reduces the stability of the A15/sigma/x phases in Nb-Co as compared to V-Co. By comparison to nonmagnetic calculations we also find that magnetism is of minor importance for the structural stability of TCP phases in Cr/Mo-Co and in V/ Nb-Co.

CL Las Vegas, NV
AB The goal of this work was to rank, as quantitatively as possible, the high-temperature scuffing characteristics of a series of Co-based materials, including coatings, for possible use in wear-critical components like those in diesel engine exhaust systems and emission-controls. A cylinder pivoting on its side against a flat tile was used as the testing geometry. All tests were performed at 600 degrees C in air. The time-dependent torque response was recorded for each 60 min test to investigate trends in friction as surfaces roughened and debris deposits built up. Candidate materials included Stellite 6B, Pleuco 33 (a white cast iron), nitrided stainless steel Type 310, IDM 5399 (a high-silicon, molybdenum iron), and coatings of both Tribaloy T-400 and Stellite 3 on stainless steel. Measurements of the damaged areas on the scuffed tiles were used to calculate a specific normal load and plot it versus the roughness of the worn tiles to map experimental results in a way that indicated the severity of scuffing for each material combination. Data on the map were annotated to reflect visual observations of the extent of damage as well. Using this test method and the foregoing criteria, nitrided type 310 stainless steel against T-400 gave the best overall performance. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Mechanical and magnetic properties of alloys near the concentration
   range of the existence of Co-3(Al,W) intermetallic compound
SO PHYSICS OF METALS AND METALLOGRAPHY
AB An experimental study of the mechanical and magnetic properties of Co-8 at % Al-X at % W (where X = 4.6; 6.8; 8.5; 10; 12) polycrystalline alloys has been carried out depending on the tungsten content. It has been shown that an increase in the tungsten content induces the following changes: Young's modulus changes from 240 to 259 GPa and the microhardness HV changes from 290 to 413 MPa. The Curie temperature of the intermetallic gamma' phase (L1(2)) grows from 1025 to 1049 K, and the saturation magnetization of the alloys decreases. The value of the coercive force also increases, from 1 to 500 Oe. The calculations of the specific heat of the gamma' (L1(2))-gamma (dcc) phase transition has shown that the highest amount of heat (304 J/g) is absorbed upon the phase transition in the sample containing the largest amount of tungsten (12.6 at %). The results obtained indicate the diffusion character of the transition, the rate of which is controlled by the diffusion of the slowest component of the alloy (in this case, tungsten). It has been found that the solvus temperature of the gamma' phase increases from 1009 to 1044A degrees C with an increase in the tungsten content from 4.6 to 12.6 at %.

TI Phase structure, morphology evolution and protective behaviors of
   chemical vapor deposited (Ni, Pt)Al coatings
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB A chemical vapor deposited (CVD) aluminizing process had been employed to deposit platinum modified aluminide coatings on the nickel-based single-crystal superalloys. The kinetics behavior, phase evolution, microstructure and chemical composition of the (Ni, Pt)Al coatings after oxidation and hot corrosion tests were studied in detail. After isothermal oxidation test, a protective alpha-Al2O3 scale is formed on the coating surface and, two new phases of (Ni, Pt)(3)Al-4 and gamma'-(Ni, Pt)(3)Al due to phase transformation reactions occur in the aluminide layer. The inward diffusion of Al element toward the substrate and, formation of micro-pores in the interface of aluminide layer and interdiffusion zone are probably the main degradation modes of the coating. Corrosive medium including of mixed of aviation fuels and artificial seawater has not serious deterioration of the coating after hot corrosion and furthermore a network of grain boundary ridges is still co-existed on the coating surface, although large of micro-pores and some of grain boundaries are appeared within the aluminide layer.

TI Mapping Chemical Selection Pathways for Designing Multicomponent Alloys:
   an informatics framework for materials design
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB A data driven methodology is developed for tracking the collective influence of the multiple attributes of alloying elements on both thermodynamic and mechanical properties of metal alloys. Cobalt-based superalloys are used as a template to demonstrate the approach. By mapping the high dimensional nature of the systematics of elemental data embedded in the periodic table into the form of a network graph, one can guide targeted first principles calculations that identify the influence of specific elements on phase stability, crystal structure and elastic properties. This provides a fundamentally new means to rapidly identify new stable alloy chemistries with enhanced high temperature properties. The resulting visualization scheme exhibits the grouping and proximity of elements based on their impact on the properties of intermetallic alloys. Unlike the periodic table however, the distance between neighboring elements uncovers relationships in a complex high dimensional information space that would not have been easily seen otherwise. The predictions of the methodology are found to be consistent with reported experimental and theoretical studies. The informatics based methodology presented in this study can be generalized to a framework for data analysis and knowledge discovery that can be applied to many material systems and recreated for different design objectives.

TI EVALUATION OF PARTITIONING RATIOS OF RE ATOMS IN
   NI-AL-RE-X(X-CR,MO,W,TI,TA,NB,CO) QUATERNARY ALLOYS
SO TETSU TO HAGANE-JOURNAL OF THE IRON AND STEEL INSTITUTE OF JAPAN
AB In order to examine alloying behaviour of rhenium (Re) and its effect on the properties of Ni-based superalloys, the partitioning ratio of Re atoms between the gamma and the gamma' phases and also the phase stability were investigated using Ni-Al-Re-X(X : Cr, Mo, W, Ti, Ta, Nb, Co) quaternary alloys. When those elements, X, which occupy preferably either Al sites or both Ni and Al sites in the Ni3Al(gamma') compound were added to the Ni-Al-Re ternary alloys, the trend of the partitioning of the Re atoms into the gamma phase became considerably high in these alloys. Also, the compositional limit of a gamma + gamma' two phase region in the phase diagram was found to be 3 similar to 4(mol%) for X(X : Mo, W, Ta, Nb) and 5 similar to 6(mol%) for Ti in Ni-Al-Re-X quaternary alloys. The results on the partitioning ratio were analyzed with the alloying vectors defined by two d-electrons parameters. As the result, it was shown that the partitioning behaviour of Re atoms in the Ni-Al-Re-X quaternary alloys were predictable using the alloying vectors.

TI Strengthening effects of alloying elements W and Re on Ni3Al: A
   first-principles study
SO COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB The structural stabilities, mechanical and thermodynamic properties of pure and alloyed Ni3Al systems have been investigated systematically, based on density functional theory and Debye-Gruneisen model. Close attentions are paid to alloying elements W and Re by studying the strengthening effects of single-alloying element W, Re, Mo, Ta, Ru and co-alloying elements WRe, WMo, ReMo, WTa, ReTa, WRu, ReRu, which substitute the Al site and the nearest neighboring Al-Al sites, respectively. The calculated formation energies and elastic constants show that all the alloyed Ni3Al are thermodynamically and mechanically stable. It is found that alloying elements W has similar effects on the mechanical and thermodynamic properties of Ni3Al to those of Re, which suggests a possibility of replacing Re with W in Ni-based single crystal superalloys. In addition, co-alloyings with different elements have no distinct synergistic enhancement but simple combined effect on the mechanical properties of Ni3Al. The enhanced chemical bondings between the alloying atoms W/Re and the neighboring host atoms Ni are considered to be the main strengthening mechanisms in W/Re alloyed Ni3Al systems.

TI On the diffusive phase transformation mechanism assisted by extended
   dislocations during creep of a single crystal CoNi-based superalloy
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB We propose here a deformation-induced diffusive phase transformation mechanism occurring during shearing of gamma' ordered phase in a gamma/gamma' single crystalline CoNi-based superalloy. Shearing involved the creation and motion of a high density of planar imperfections. Through correlative electron microscopy and atom probe tomography, we captured a superlattice intrinsic stacking fault (SISF) and its associated moving leading partial dislocation (LPD). The structure and composition of these imperfections reveal characteristic chemical structural contrast. The SISF locally exhibits a D0(19) ordered structure coherently embedded in the L-12 gamma' and enriched in W and Co. Interestingly, the LPD is enriched with Cr and Co, while the adjoining planes ahead of the LPD are enriched with Al. Quantitative analysis of the three-dimensional compositional field in the vicinity of imperfections sheds light onto a new in-plane diffusion mechanism as the LPD moves on specific {111)}evier planes upon application of stress at high temperature.

TI Creep behavior of a gamma '-strengthened Co-base alloy with zero
   gamma/gamma '-lattice misfit at 800 degrees C, 196 MPa
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS RESEARCH
AB Deformation and structural behavior of an experimental gamma'-strengthened Co-base alloy during creep at 800 degrees C and 196 MPa have been investigated. The characteristic features of this alloy are zero gamma/gamma'-lattice misfit and a fine gamma/gamma'-microstructure. In the initial condition, the gamma'-precipitates in this alloy are small (size of about 100 nm), have polyhedral morphology, and are separated by the very narrow c-channels (width of about 10 nm). The tests performed up to about 1% creep strain (about 500 h creep time) gave creep curves with a slow constant strain rate and without an apparent transient creep, typical for superalloys with nonzero misfit. In this initial stage of creep, entering of the narrow c-channels by dislocations is blocked by a strong Orowan force. The micromechanism of creep was identified as an octahedral glide of < 011 > superdislocations simultaneously in two phases, gamma and gamma'. The gamma/gamma'-microstructure with zero misfit shows no rafting but rapidly coarsens isotropically. It is concluded that zero misfit is beneficial at the initial stages of the creep but is unfavourable for longterm creep because of the continuous microstructural coarsening.

TI Density and Molar Volume of Liquid Iron Containing Nb
SO STEEL RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL
AB Densities of liquid iron containing Nb up to 0.198wtpct were measured with the modified sessile drop method in a temperature range from 1510 to 1610 degrees C. The densities decrease linearly with increase in temperature and increase with increase in niobium content. The thermal expansion coefficient of molten liquid containing Nb increases linearly with increase in niobium content. An equation for density of liquid iron containing niobium has been derived from the measured results as a function of temperature and niobium content as follows: rho(103kgm-3)=7.03+0.75x[%Nb]-(7.54+6.92x[%Nb])x10-4(T-1530)1510 degrees CT1610 degrees C,Tin degrees C
   The difference between the measured and calculated values is in the range of -0.26 to +0.29pct. The molar volume of liquid iron containing Nb at the same temperature decreases with increase in niobium content. The partial molar volume of niobium in liquid iron decreases with increase in temperature, while that of iron increases with temperature. The densities calculated with the partial molar volumes are in good agreement with the measured ones for the iron-niobium binary alloys.

AB Nickel- and cobalt-based superalloys have been developed and are used in the hot sections of gas turbines in order to meet complex high-temperature phenomena. The gas temperature in modern engines exceeds 1650 degrees C in the turbine section and its cooled parts reach temperatures as high as 1200 degrees C. During operation, the structural materials degrade by fatigue, creep, oxidation, corrosion and erosive wear. Protective coatings provide barriers between the alloys and outer environment and, in particular, they enhance a resistance to oxidation and hot corrosion. The metallic coatings can be divided into two categories: diffusion and overlay coatings. Diffusion aluminide coatings (DAC) are based on the intermetallic compound beta-NiAl that forms under the influence of the substrate. Although DAC have been enjoying wide application, they have a limitation which arises from no deliberate changes of their properties to meet requirements of specific service conditions. This article is focused on a detection of damage that formed in the diffusion coatings on first stage turbine blades after two different short-term overheating events. Motivation for this study came from demands for an extension of our knowledge of degradation mechanisms. A possibility of a non-destructive assessment of the damage level using suitable damage parameters is also briefly described.

SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB By virtue of XRD, OM, SEM and EDS, detailed oxidation behaviors for 2000h exposure of DD6 Ni-based single crystal superalloy ware investigated at 1050 degrees C and 1100 degrees C. The oxidation kinetic curves both follow the parabolic law in the first stage, during which time the oxidation behaviors in interdendritic area and dendrite core area are different. With the oxidation time continuing, the morphologies of the oxides in these two kinds of areas gradually tend to coincide: An outer columnar (Ni, Co)O, an intermediate layer mainly composed of NiTa2O6, CoCo2O4, CoWO4, NiCr2O4 and other complex compounds and spinel phases, an inner continuous layer of alpha-Al2O3. The double diffusion of oxygen anions and Ni and Co cations developed inwards and outwards respectively is responsible for the morphology of the oxide scale. At 1100 degrees C, the Al2O3 film formed in the initial time is unstable, discontinuous and incompact and the inner Al2O3 layer formed after 300 h oxidation is porous. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI Theoretical investigations of solid-solution effect on the twinning of
   Ni
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF SOLIDS
AB In terms of first-principles method, the influences of Co, Cr, Fe, Ta, Mo and W atoms on the generalized stacking fault energy of Ni are investigated. The bridge between stacking fault energy and twinning is comprehensively constructed by various previous criterions. Our calculation results indicate that the addition of Mo has the maximum positive effect on the twinning of Ni, while Cr shows the minimum effect. The ranking sequence of twinning abilities can be drawn as: Ni-Mo > Ni-Fe approximate to Ni-Ta > Ni-W > Ni-Co > Ni > Ni-Cr. On the other hand, the addition of Fe or Ta significantly reduces the intrinsic stacking fault energy of Ni, which is beneficial to obtain the dislocation glide during deformations. Based on the analysis of charge density, the bonding characteristics near the fault plane are observed to reveal the electronic redistribution during the slipping. It is found that the intrinsic stacking fault configuration and double-layers twin configuration reconstitute stable bonds near the fault plane corresponding to two valley points of the GSFE curve, while these bonds will be disrupted under a series of displacements.

AB In this report we investigate the onset and evolution of precipitation in the early stages of ageing in the alloy WE 91, a variant of the Ni-Fe-Cr superalloy Inconel 718 (IN718). Transmission electron microscopy and atom probe tomography were used to study the size and volume fraction of gamma' and gamma '' precipitates and the extent of pre-precipitate clustering of Al/Ti and Nb.
   Co-located gamma' and gamma '' precipitates were observed from the shortest ageing times that precipitates could be visualised using atom probe. At shorter times, prior to the observation of precipitates, clustering of Al/Ti and Nb was shown to occur. The respective volume fraction of the gamma' and gamma '' precipitates and the clustering of Al/Ti and Nb suggest that gamma '' nucleates prior to gamma' during ageing at 706 degrees C for this alloy.

TI Chemical stripping methods for the removal of NiCrAlY thermal spray
   coatings
SO KOVOVE MATERIALY-METALLIC MATERIALS
AB The present paper is focused on the "stripping" of serviced blades and vanes for gas turbine, which need the removal of the coating in order to be repaired and refitted with a new coating. The stripping process requires, normally, the separate removal of the top coat (Yttria Partially Stabilized Zirconia, YPSZ) and of the bond coat (MCrAlY where M stays for Co, Ni or both). The present paper examines only chemical procedures able to remove the NiCrAlY bond coat. The blades and vanes surfaces after removal of NiCrAlY coatings were characterized from the point of view of surface morphology, metallurgical structure and chemical composition. The efficiency of the acid solution in NiCrAlY removal has been investigated and the behaviour of two Ni based alloys substrates in aggressive environment has been tested. The HCl based stripping solution shows good performances in Vacuum Plasma Sprayed NiCrAlY coatings removal from Ni superalloys. The tested stripping procedure is fast and safe because no damage to base materials has been noted.

   Ultra-Supercritical Power Plant Applications Beyond 700 degrees C
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA-ENGLISH LETTERS
AB Some existing wrought Ni-Cr-Co-based superalloys are being evaluated as the candidate materials for advanced ultra-supercritical power plant applications beyond 700 degrees C due to their high creep strength. But they are all prohibitively expensive due to the addition of Co, Mo and W. Here we developed a new Ni-Fe-Cr-based superalloy (named as HT700 alloy) with low cost and high strength. This paper reports the mechanical properties and fracture modes of HT700 alloy to support its high temperature applications and to understand prospective failure mechanism. Fracto-graphic examinations indicate that the fracture modes shift with test condition change. In addition, the HT700 alloy has relatively stable microstructure at 750 degrees C. Compared with IN740 and GH2984 alloys, this new alloy has higher yield strength in the temperature range from room temperature to 800 degrees C. The creep life of this new alloy is much longer than that of the Ni-Fe-based superalloy GH2984. The results suggest that this new alloy is a promising material for advanced ultra-supercritical power plant applications beyond 700 degrees C.

TI First principles calculations of alloying element diffusion coefficients
   in Ni using the five-frequency model
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB The diffusion coefficients of several alloying elements (Al, Mo, Co, Ta, Ru, W, Cr, Re) in Ni are directly calculated using the five-frequency model and the first principles density functional theory. The correlation factors provided by the five-frequency model are explicitly calculated. The calculated diffusion coefficients show their excellent agreement with the available experimental data. Both the diffusion pre-factor (D-0) and the activation energy (Q) of impurity diffusion are obtained. The diffusion coefficients above 700 K are sorted in the following order: D-Al > D-Cr > D-Co > D-Ta > D-Mo > D-Ru > D-W > D-Re. It is found that there is a positive correlation between the atomic radius of the solute and the jump energy of Ni that results in the rotation of the solute-vacancy pair (E-1). The value of E-2-E-1 (E-2 is the solute diffusion energy) and the correlation factor each also show a positive correlation. The larger atoms in the same series have lower diffusion activation energies and faster diffusion coefficients.

TI Measurement of the density of binary Ni-X (X=Co, W, Ta, Al) alloys
SO MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS
CT 10th World Titanium Conference
CY JUL, 2003
CL Hamburg, GERMANY
AB The modified sessile drop method (MSDM) and modified pycnometric method (MPM) have been employed to measure the densities of liquid Ni-Co, Ni-W, Ni-Ta and Ni-Al alloys precisely. In the case of Ni-Al alloys measurements were also made in the "mushy" state where both solid and liquid coexist. There was a good agreement between the values measured by the two methods. The density of liquid Ni-base binary alloys from the melting points to 1833 K and that of Ni-Al alloys in the mushy state decrease linearly with increasing temperature. The temperature coefficient of the density of Ni-base binary alloys measured in this work was regressed as a quadratic function of the concentration of alloy element. The measured density of Ni-base binary alloys at any required temperature can also be expressed as a quadratic function of the concentration of alloy element. The recommended equations for the density of Ni-base binary alloys were obtained as a function of composition and temperature by regressing the density values measured by both MSDM and MPM. The calculated values from the recommended density equations show good agreement with those obtained with both methods.

TI Dependence on the Chromium Content of the High-Temperature Oxidation
   Behavior of Ta-Rich Nickel-Based Cast Alloys
SO OXIDATION OF METALS
AB The high-temperature stability of primary tantalum carbides is a problem of importance for chromium-rich cast alloys, based on cobalt or nickel. The focus of this study was nickel-based alloys, as these alloys are particularly sensitive to a lack of TaC in the as-cast state and by dissolution due to high-temperature exposure. In this work, a possible way for promoting the formation of many TaC precipitates by changing from the usual 30 wt% chromium content was investigated. Five alloys with Cr content varying from 10 to 50 wt% were prepared and then subjected to microstructure characterization and to oxidation tests. In contrast with what was expected, decreasing the Cr content in comparison with the Ni-30Cr-0.4C-6Ta reference alloy did not succeed in obtaining more TaC precipitates, but instead had the opposite effect. Concerning the high-temperature oxidation behavior at 1127 and 1237 A degrees C, loss of resistance was observed only for a Cr content at the lower level of 10 wt%. It was noticed that a subscale CrTaO4 developed during oxidation and seemed to promote oxide spallation during cooling.

SO CORROSION SCIENCE
AB Corrosion behavior of the N5 superalloy (Ni-7.0 Cr-6.2 Al-7.5 Co-5.0 W-1.5 Mo-6.5 Ta-3.0 Re) and two nanocrystalline coatings prepared by magnetron sputtering is investigated in chlorine and water vapor environment at 700 degrees C. The alloy shows low corrosion resistance. Its oxide scale spalls off readily and includes porous NiO outer layer and NiCr(Al)(2)O-4 inner one. The nanocrystalline coating performs better. Its oxide scale consists of Al2O3, NiO and Ta2O5. Chlorination and/or oxidation of Ta ruined compactness of scale. The yttrium modified nanocrystalline coating provides the highest corrosion resistance. Its scale is exclusively alumina. Yttrium inhibits the outward diffusion of Ta.

   superalloy
SO MATERIALS CHARACTERIZATION
AB Analytical electron microscopy and spectroscopy analyses of the fusion zone (FZ) microstructure in autogenous laser beam welded Haynes 282 (HY 282) superalloy were performed. The micro-segregation patterns observed in the FZ indicate that Co, Cr and Al exhibited a nearly uniform distribution between the dendrite core and interdendritic regions while Ti and Mo were rejected into the interdendritic liquid during the weld solidification. Transmission electron diffraction analysis and energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis revealed the second phase particles formed along the FZ interdendritic region to be Ti-Mo rich MC-type carbide particles. Weld FZ solidification cracking, which is sometimes associated with the formation of gamma-gamma' eutectic in gamma' precipitation strengthened nickel-base superalloys, was not observed in the HY 282 superalloy. Modified primary solidification path due to carbon addition in the newly developed superalloy is used to explain preclusion of weld FZ solidification cracking in the material. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

TI Friction and wear behaviour of Inconel 718 alloy fabricated by selective
   laser melting after heat treatments
SO PHILOSOPHICAL MAGAZINE LETTERS
AB The effect of heat treatments (solution and double aging) on friction and wear behaviour of Inconel 718 (IN718) alloy fabricated by selective laser melting (SLM) were studied. After heat treatment of solution and double aging, the friction and wear of the alloy have been improved. The worn surfaces of heat-treated IN718 alloy became smoother, and micro-ploughing became shallower. After solid solution hearting, a portion of the Laves phase ((Ni, Fe, Co)(2)(Nb, Ti, Mo)) dissolves into the matrix, after which the gamma '' phase (Ni3Nb) andthe equilibrium phase of the delta phase (Ni3Nb) precipitates during double ageing. After solution and double aging, nano-scale gamma ' (Ni-3(Al, Ti)) and gamma '' phases distribute homogeneously in the matrix, which improves the material hardness and wear resistance of the SLMed IN718 alloy.

TI Microstructural analysis of creep exposed IN617 alloy
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Ni base alloys such as IN617 are one of the preferred choices for steam turbine components used by fossil fuelled power generation plants. IN617 is a solid solution strengthened Ni based superalloy containing similar to 23%Cr, 12%Co and 9%Mo with low content of precipitation strengthening elements Al, Ti and Nb. In the 'as received' (solution annealed condition), the microstructure consists of primary carbides (M23C6) and occasional TiN particles dispersed in a single phase austenitic matrix. Owing to high temperature exposure and the creep deformation processes that occur in service, evolution of the microstructure occurs. This results in secondary precipitation and precipitate coarsening, both on grain boundaries and intragranularly in areas of high dislocation density. The influence of creep deformation on the solution treated IN617 alloy at an operating condition of 650 degrees C/574 h, with emphasis on the morphology and distribution of carbide/nitride precipitation is discussed. The applied stress was at an intermediate level.

TI Effect of Volume Fraction on the Coarsening of Pb Nanophase in Al-Pb
   Nanocomposite Alloys Prepared by High Energy Ball Milling
SO RARE METAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING
AB The effect of volume fraction on the coarsening of Pb nanophase in Al-Pb nanocomposite alloys prepared by high energy ball milling has been studied by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The coarsening of Pb nanophase with different volume fractions in Al-Pb nanocomposite alloys follows the cubic growth law even though the size of the constituent phase is in nanometer range. The coarsening rate of Pb nanophase increases distinctly as the volume fraction increases, and the variation of coarsening rate is greater than the theoretical prediction in this composition range. The activation energy for coarsening of Pb nanophase does not vary with volume fraction. The coarsening of Pb nanophase is controlled by grain boundary diffusion for solute atoms in solvent matrix.

SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY
AB Microstructure in the weld line (WL) zone produced by inertial friction welding has been studied for a series of RR1000-RR1000 welds using transmission electron and scanning electron microscopy. A fully recrystallised fine grain structure was found to form throughout the WL zone, characterized by straight and smooth grain boundaries, high energy status and modified grain boundary chemistry due to very fast cooling after welding. Very fine gamma' particles with unimodal size distribution were reprecipitated in the WL zone. The fine gamma' particles are spherical in shape, high in number density and characterized by an imbalanced chemistry, containing less Al, Ti, Ni, Ta gamma'-forming elements but more Cr, Co, Mo gamma-forming elements than all types of parent gamma' particles. As a result, a hard and strong WL zone was produced by the inertial friction welding. (C) 2011 Elsevier BM. All rights reserved.

AB The layer-by-layer building of monolithic, 3D metal components from selectively melted powder layers using laser or electron beams is a novel form of 3D printing or additive manufacturing. Microstructures created in these 3D products can involve novel, directional solidification structures which can include crystallographically oriented grains containing columnar arrays of precipitates characteristic of a microstructural architecture. These microstructural architectures are advantageously rendered in 3D image constructions involving light optical microscopy and scanning and transmission electron microscopy observations. Microstructural evolution can also be effectively examined through 3D image sequences which, along with x-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis in the x-y and x-z planes, can effectively characterize related crystallographic/texture variances. This paper compares 3D microstructural architectures in Co-base and Ni-base superalloys, columnar martensitic grain structures in 17-4 PH alloy, and columnar copper oxides and dislocation arrays in copper.

TI Numerical Simulation for gamma/theta Interface Properties of Ni Base

SO RARE METAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING
AB By using molecular dynamics method with the second nearest neighbor modified embedded-atom method (2NN MEAM) interatomic potential, we studied the gamma/theta-DO22 interfacial structure of Ni-Al-V superalloy at different compositions, and calculated the interfacial energy and the work of separation on the interfaces. The research shows that with the Al atom concentration increasing, the interfacial energy increases while the work of separation decreases; with the concentration of V atoms increasing, the interfacial energy increases first and then decreases; but the change of atomic concentration has little effect on the work of separation; and the interfacial energy and the work of separation are closely related to the interfacial migration. The results can be used to further study the dynamic behavior of Ni-Al-V superalloys in the process of precipitation, such as the composition segregation and interfacial migration, so the research has great guiding significance to the alloy design.

SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB A detailed analysis of the time-dependent factors affecting the chromium-aluminization of the nickel-base superalloy Rene 80H in cementation packs at 1120 degrees C has been carried out. The packs contained a 4% NaCl+2% NH4Cl mixed activator and a Cr-5 wt.% Al master alloy. The analysis involved measuring the residual pack activator-mixture content and master alloy composition as functions of deposition time, and using the data to calculate equilibrium partial pressures in the pack as a function of time. It is shown that both activator-mixture content and master alloy composition change with time, consequently leading to changes in the pack gas phase composition. The changes in the pack environment are then used to explain the time-dependence of coating surface composition: a simplified mechanism involving a combined parabolic accumulation of beta-NiAl and two-stage linear accumulation of alpha-Cr is described.

AB Correlative high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy are used to study deformation-induced planar faults in the single-crystal superalloy MD2 crept at 800 degrees C and 650 MPa. Segregation of Cr and Co at microtwins, anti-phase boundaries (APB), and complex/superlattice extrinsic and intrinsic stacking faults (CESF/SESF and CISF/SISF) is confirmed and quantified. The extent of this is found to depend upon the fault type, being most pronounced for the APB. The CESF/SESF is studied in detail due to its role as a precursor of the microtwins causing the majority of plasticity under these conditions. Quantitative modeling is carried out to rationalize the findings; the experimental results are consistent with a greater predicted velocity for the lengthening of the CESF/SESF-compared with the other types of fault-and hence confirm its role in the diffusion-assisted plasticity needed for the microtwinning mechanism to be operative.

The solute atoms considered include Al, Co, Cr, Hf, Mo, Nb, Re, Ru, Ta, Ti, and W. The calculations were performed using supercells with 1 solute atom and 107 solvent atoms. It is found that the atomic size difference, the electronic interactions, and the magnetic spin relations between the solute and solvent atoms all contribute to the lattice distortions. Based on the results from first-principles calculations, the linear composition coefficients of fcc Ni lattice parameter for different solutes were determined, and the lattice parameters of multicomponent Ni-base superalloys as a function of solute composition were predicted. The results are compared with existing experimental measurements, and good agreements are obtained for both the compositional dependence of lattice parameters and the local lattice distortions.

AB The oxidation behavior of HVOF sprayed Cr3C2-NiCr coatings on 310S stainless steel for 50 cycles in air at 700 degrees C under cyclic conditions has been investigated in the present work. The microstructure, hardness and porosity of the coating were characterised. X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscope with energy dispersive spectroscopy and X-ray mapping were used to analyze the scales formed on the surface of the oxidised samples. The microstructure of the as sprayed coating showed uniformly distributed chrome carbide-rich ceramic grains attached with nickel chrome-rich binder phase. The Cr3C2-25% NiCr coated specimen exihibit negligible microspalling of the scales upon oxidation. The improved oxidation resistance of Cr3C2-NiCr coatings may be attributed to the formation of oxides of chromium, nickel, and spinels of nickel and chromium.

AB Derived from Russian alloy CHS88U, six experimental Ni-base alloys named as A to F in the Ni-Cr-Co-W-Ti-AI-Hf system are designed, evaluated and processed. One of these alloys, F, shows excellent high temperature tensile strength and ductility with superior creep rupture properties. As predicted by using modeling tools such as PHACOM and NEW PHACOMP, there is hardly the tendency for formation of topologically close-packed phase (TCP) phase in alloy F. Furthermore, through microstructural observation, it is also found that no TCP phase is formed in alloy F after long-time exposure at high temperature. So alloy F has well balance of phase stability and mechanical properties in view of application for gas turbines. It is proved that d-electron approach can be applied for design and development of nickel-base superalloys for gas turbine application.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMPACT ENGINEERING
AB The dynamic yield and fracture stress of two refractory alloys were measured under shock-wave loading at normal and elevated (up to 680 degreesC) temperatures. The tested materials were polycrystalline nickel-based superalloy Inconel IN738LC and PWA 1483 Ni-Co-Fe alloy in quasi-monocrystalline state. Both alloys are used as turbine blade materials for the hot first stages of gas turbines. The alloys exhibit nonmonotonous dependence of the dynamic yield strength upon temperature with an abrupt increase in the temperature interval of 550-600 degreesC. The dynamic tensile strength, in general, is less sensitive to temperature and shows less pronounced increase in the vicinity of 570 degreesC. The observed anomalies of the dynamic strength properties correlate with anomalies in the heat capacity which are associated with the equilibrating of the short-range order in the gamma-matrix of the alloys.

TI Leaching kinetics, separation, and recovery of rhenium and component
   metals from CMSX-4 superalloys using hydrometallurgical processes
SO SEPARATION AND PURIFICATION TECHNOLOGY
AB A study to leach and recycle rhenium from CMSX-4, a second generation ultrahigh-strength single crystal nickel-based superalloy, containing 3% rhenium is presented. Experimental factors involved in the leaching process of rhenium from CMSX-4 using aqua-regia solution have been investigated and reported. Experimental factors such as concentration of aqua-regia, the use of sonication, leaching period, solid-to-liquid ratio and stirring speed have been optimised and the leaching kinetics of rhenium and other component metals of superalloy CMSX-4 have been studied. Increasing aqua-regia concentration to 100% (v/v) resulted in more than 30% gain in recovery which can be attributed to the increased availability of leaching reagents. The leaching kinetics of rhenium from superalloy CMSX-4 in 100% aqua-regia solution fit into a chemical reaction controlled kinetics model for the first period of leaching. For the leaching period after 480 min, the leaching kinetics of rhenium fits a diffusion through the product layer model. Application of ultrasonic waves to the leaching process has proven useful to slightly increase yield. Given the small increase, however, sonication may not be economically feasible for recovery of rhenium on an industrial scale. Precipitation of other metals away from the rhenium rich solution has also been explored to prepare the solution for a downstream rhenium recovery process. It was found that that two unique precipitates can be recovered from the solution. The first precipitate, recovered at pH 5.05, has been determined to be mainly composed of the oxides of aluminium, chromium, molybdenum, and titanium. A green precipitate of mixed hydroxides of cobalt and nickel (MHP) which has commercial value can then be recovered at pH 7.0 leaving a rhenium enriched solution for further processing.

TI LONG-RANGE ORDERING KINETICS AND ORDERING ENERGY IN NI3AL-BASED
   GAMMA'-ALLOYS
SO INTERMETALLICS
AB Chemical long-range order kinetics were studied for the Ll2-ordered gamma'-phase domains of the quasi-binary systems Ni75AL25-xMx (M=Fe, Mn, Cr, 0 less-than-or-equal-to x less-than-or-equal-to 25), where the gamma'-phase stability (ordering energy) rapidly decreases with increasing M-component concentration x.
   The sample gamma' homogeneity was tested by means of transmission electron microscopy. The 'order-order' relaxations measured by means of in-situ resistometry indicated that an increase in x caused a systematic decrease in the activation energy, E(A), of homogeneous long-range order kinetics.
   Discussing a possible influence of various parameters, it was concluded that the observed decrease in E(A) was predominantly due to an effect of the ordering energy on the bulk vacancy diffusion in these Ll2-ordered compounds.

TI Preventing high-temperature oxidation of Co-Cr-based dental alloys by
   boron doping
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY B
AB Biomedical Co-Cr-based alloys used in dental restorations are usually subjected to high-temperature treatments during manufacturing. Therefore, it is practically essential to characterise and control the oxide films formed on the surfaces of these alloys during heat treatment in terms of material loss, the accuracy of fit, and the aesthetics of dental restorations. In this work, the effects of boron doping on the surface oxide films formed on Ni-free Co-28Cr-9W-1Si (mass%) dental alloys under short-term exposure to high temperatures, which simulate the manufacturing process of porcelain-fused-to-metal (PFM) restorations, were investigated. The surface oxides primarily consisted of Cr2O3 in all prepared alloys. The chemical composition of these surface layers varies with the B concentration in the bulk, with the addition of boron stabilising the dense Cr2O3 phase in the oxide films. Nanoscale boron enrichment is clearly observed at the interface between the oxide films and the metal substrate, with the oxidation of boron atoms leading to the formation of a B2O3 layer. Since B2O3 and Cr2O3 prevent oxygen diffusion, the surface oxide films on the boron-containing alloys are thinner; however, no additional thinning was observed when increasing the boron content from 0.01 to 0.8 mass%. It was also found that a small amount of boron does not degrade the corrosion properties of the alloys in a 0.9% NaCl solution. The results obtained in this study will aid in the improvement of manufacturing processes, and ultimately, the performance of PFM restorations.

TI Effects of alloying element and temperature on the stacking fault
   energies of dilute Ni-base superalloys
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER
AB A systematic study of stacking fault energy (gamma(SF)) resulting from induced alias shear deformation has been performed by means of first-principles calculations for dilute Ni-base superalloys (Ni23X and Ni71X) for various alloying elements (X) as a function of temperature. Twenty-six alloying elements are considered, i.e., Al, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hf, Ir, Mn, Mo, Nb, Os, Pd, Pt, Re, Rh, Ru, Sc, Si, Ta, Tc, Ti, V, W, Y, Zn, and Zr. The temperature dependence of gamma(SF) is computed using the proposed quasistatic approach based on a predicted gamma(SF)-volume-temperature relationship. Besides gamma(SF), equilibrium volume and the normalized stacking fault energy (Gamma(SF) = gamma(SF)/Gb, with G the shear modulus and b the Burgers vector) are also studied as a function of temperature for the 26 alloying elements. The following conclusions are obtained: all alloying elements X studied herein decrease the gamma(SF) of fcc Ni, approximately the further the alloying element X is from Ni on the periodic table, the larger the decrease of gamma(SF) for the dilute Ni-X alloy, and roughly the gamma(SF) of Ni-X decreases with increasing equilibrium volume. In addition, the values of gamma(SF) for all Ni-X systems decrease with increasing temperature (except for Ni-Cr at higher Cr content), and the largest decrease is observed for pure Ni. Similar to the case of the shear modulus, the variation of gamma(SF) for Ni-X systems due to various alloying elements is traceable from the distribution of (magnetization) charge density: the spherical distribution of charge density around a Ni atom, especially a smaller sphere, results in a lower value of gamma(SF) due to the facility of redistribution of charges. Computed stacking fault energies and the related properties are in favorable accord with available experimental and theoretical data.

AB The high temperature strength of alloys with (gamma +gamma') microstructure is primarily due to the resistance of the ordered precipitate to cutting by matrix dislocations. Such shearing requires higher stresses since it involves the creation of a planar fault. Planar fault energy is known to be dependent on composition. This implies that the composition on the fault may be different from that in the bulk for energetic reasons. Such segregation (or desegregation) of specific alloying elements to the fault may result in Suzuki strengthening which has not been explored extensively in these systems. In this work, segregation (or desegregation) of alloying elements to planar faults was studied computationally in Ni-3(Al, Ti) and Co-3(W, Al) type gamma' precipitates. The composition dependence of APB energy and heat of mixing were evaluated from first principle electronic structure calculations. A phase field model incorporating the first principles results, was used to simulate the motion of an extended superdislocation under stress concurrently with composition evolution. Results reveal that in both systems, significant (de) segregation occurs on equilibration. On application of stress, solutes were dragged along with the APB in some cases. Additionally, it was also noted the velocity of the superdislocation under an applied stress is strongly dependent on atomic mobility (i. e. diffusivity).

TI The alloying element dependence of the local lattice deformation and the
   elastic properties of Ni3Al: A molecular dynamics simulation
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Molecular dynamics (MD) together with the modified analytical embedded atom method (MAEAM) is employed to study the alloying elements (Re, Ru, Co, and Ta) dependence of the elastic properties of L1(2)-Ni3Al. The investigations indicate that the calculated elastic properties of Ni3Al are in reasonable agreement with the previous results. The substituting formation energies of the alloying elements in Ni3Al are calculated to determine the site preference. It is found out that Re, Ru, and Ta atoms prefer to occupy the Al sites, and the Co atom prefers to occupy the Ni site. Based on Re, Ru, and Ta substituting the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th nearest-neighbor atoms, we ascertain that the substituting manners of these alloying elements have a decisive effect on the bulk modulus and the local crystal lattice of Ni3Al. Moreover, for Re, the bonding interaction plays a predominant role in the improvement in the bulk modulus of Ni3Al, whereas the size effect of Ru and Ta on the improvement in the bulk modulus is more obvious. Finally, the potential reasons of which the alloying elements enhance the bulk modulus are discussed in details. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.

AB The deposition of high wear- and corrosion-resistant alloys through Plasma Transferred Arc (PTA) is an easily automated process combining the possibility to obtain very thick coatings with high deposition speeds, low thermal distortion of the part and negligible dilution levels, thanks to a very high energy-concentration [S.

Literature studies regard mostly wear or high temperature behaviour of the deposited alloys and plasma hardening treatment without powder [Applied Surface Science 201 (2002) 154, Surface and Coatings Technology 71 (1995) 196, Journal of Materials Processing Technology 128 (2002) 169, M.

An experimental campaign has been carried out on the deposition of two nickel- and a cobalt-base superalloys: Hastelloy 276, Inconel 625 and Stellite 6. Benchmarks of C-Mn steel have been chosen to test geometrical configurations that are critical for the application (corners and grooves). Specimen characterisation through liquid penetration inspection, optical- and scanning electron microscopy and microhardness tests proved that process parameters optimisation depends only on the geometrical configuration and not on the deposited alloy. This result suggests the importance of an accurate design of the reciprocal positioning and movement between the torch and the part to be coated, as a function of the deposition geometry.

TI Bubble Nucleation During Oxidation of SiC
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CERAMIC SOCIETY
AB Oxidation of SiC at 1400 degrees C-1700 degrees C produces carbon monoxide (CO), which can form bubbles at the interface between the substrate and the silica (SiO2) overgrowth. The bubbles add complexity to the mechanistic understanding of the oxidation process. We analyze the kinetics of bubble formation, where the driving force for their nucleation depends on the partial pressure of CO while their growth is determined by the viscosity of silica. The mechanism bears analogy to oxygen migrating from the atmosphere into superalloys, and reacting with carbide precipitates at the grain boundaries to nucleate bubbles of carbon monoxide, or hydrogen migrating into carbon-steel to form methane. The unique feature of the present case is the ability of silica to release the gas pressure within the bubbles by viscous flow, and then, to heal the crater that is left behind. As the bubbles grow out from the interface and escape into the atmosphere, they can expose bare surface to the atmosphere rendering silicon carbide vulnerable to active oxidation. The relative significance of the mechanisms of oxidation of SiC is presented in the form of an oxidation map, where atmospheric pO2 and oxidation temperature are the experimental variables. We discover that experiments often lie in the regime of bubble formation.

AB Prototypical single-crystal NiAlCrX superalloys were studied to examine the effects of the common major alloying elements, Co, Mo, Nb, Ta, Ti, and W, on yielding behavior. The alloys contained about 10 at. pct Cr, 60 vol pet of the gamma' phase, and about 3 at. pct of X in the gamma'. The critical resolved shear stresses (CRSSs) for octahedral and primary cube slip were measured at 760 degrees C, which is about the peak strength temperature. The CRSSoct and CRSScube are discussed in relation to thoseof Ni-3 (Al, X) gamma' alloys taken from the literature and the gamma'/gamma lattice mismatch. The CRSSoct ofthe gamma + gamma' alloys reflected a similar compositional dependence to that of both the CRSScube of the gamma' phase and the gamma/gamma' lattice parameter mismatch. The CRSScube of the gamma + gamma' alloys also reflected the compositional dependence of the gamma'/gamma mismatch, but bore no similarity to that of CRSScube for gamma' alloys since it is controlled by the gamma matrix. The ratio of CRSScube/CRSSoct was decreased by all alloying elements except Co, which increased the ratio. The decrease in CRSScube/CRSSoct was related to the degree in which elements partition to ehe gamma' rather than the gamma phase.

AB The effects of platinum (Pt) layer on phase transformation and oxidation behavior of MCrAlY (M = Co, Ni) coatings were investigated by isothermal and cyclic oxidation tests at temperature of 1100 degrees C. Pt layer of about 5 mu m thickness was deposited on MAR M247-DS superalloy byan electroplating method, and then the MCrAlY layers were coated with air plasma spray (APS) and vacuum plasma spray (VPS) methods. APS process creates internal oxides and interface voids, whereas the VPS process shows fewer voids in the interface between the MCrAlY layer and the superalloy used as substrate. The oxides and voids formed in the APS process deteriorate the oxidation resistance, indicating that the oxides and voids are transferred to Al2O3 compounds during the oxidation tests. The Pt layer shows a strong affinity with Ni element and a weak affinity with Co and Cr elements, resulting in the formation of beta-(Ni,Pt)Al phase. The Pt pre-coated layer forces down for the diffusion of soluble elements to get the reduced deplete zone in the superalloy. The VPS process enhances the oxidation resistance of the MCrAlY coating and shows better bonding strength, owing to the generation of homogenous microstructure in the coating and less processing defects.

SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB Advanced thermal barrier coatings are essential to further increase the efficiency of gas turbine engines. One limiting factor of the TBC lifetime is the temperature dependent formation of the thermally grown oxide (TGO) during thermal exposure resulting in critical stress levels at the top coat-bond coat interface. Oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) bond coats demonstrated slower oxygen scale growth during thermal exposure in comparison to standard bond coats.
   In this study for the first time TBC samples on single-crystal substrates (comparable to CMSX4) with thin ODS Co-based flash coats on the same Co-based bond coat (Amdry 995) and a porous atmospherically plasma sprayed (APS) yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) topcoat were manufactured by thermal spray techniques and evaluated with respect to their thermal cyclic behavior. As the major performance test cyclic burner rigs, which can establish thermal conditions similar to those in gas turbines, were applied.
   TBC samples with the new material combination show superior performance compared to previous samples. Cross sections of the samples were analyzed by scanning electron and laser scanning microscopy. Lifetime data and failure mode of the samples are discussed with respect to material properties such as thermal expansion coefficients, microstructural changes and TGO growth.

TI THE HOT-CORROSION BEHAVIOR OF NOVEL CO-DEPOSITED CHROMIUM-MODIFIED
   ALUMINIDE COATINGS
SO OXIDATION OF METALS
AB This paper reports the successful co-deposition of inclusion-free chromium-modified aluminide coatings using a pack-cementation process. The substrate used was the nickel-base superalloy, Rene 80H. The coatings were of the outward-diffusion type; however, unlike the usual outward-diffusion coatings, the present coatings were relatively free of pack inclusions. The coatings consisted of alpha-Cr precipitates in a matrix of beta-NiAl. The morphology and distribution of the alpha- Cr precipitates could be adjusted to the extent that two types of coating structures could be obtained. The Type I coating structure contained lamellar alpha- Cr precipitates situated in the surface region of the coating, whereas the Type II coating structure contained small, spheroidal alpha-Cr precipitates distributed throughout the outer of a two-layered coating. Both coating types exhibited significantly improved hot-corrosion resistance in a 0.1% SO2-O2 environment at 900-degrees-C compared to a commercial aluminide coalting. A study of the corrosion behavior of Type I coatings containing pack inclusions showed that the inclusions were deleterious to the corrosion resistance of the coatings. The corrosion behavior of chromium-aluminide coatings was dependent on both the distribution and amount of alpha-Cr precipitates in the coating.

The formation of different crystal structures (FCC, BCC, or FCC+BCC mixture) and its effects on the resulting mechanical properties of this series of HEAs, both in tension and compression, were evaluated. It was found that, in the BCC-dominated HEAs, ordered B2 precipitates were always coherently dispersed in the BCC solid-solution matrix. The shape of these B2 precipitates was strongly affected by the lattice misfit between the disordered BCC and ordered B2. A uniform distribution of cuboidal B2 particles could be obtained by properly adjusting M, thus the lattice misfit, in a manner similar to that in Ni-based superalloys, Strengthening effects caused by different BCC/B2 morphologies were also estimated and compared with experimental measurements. The optimal strengthening as a function of the shape and size of the coherent precipitates was discussed in light of the lattice misfit in these HEAs. (C) 2018 Acta Materialia Inc.

TI Estimation of gamma/gamma ' interfacial energy in Ni-Co base superalloy
   TMW-4M3
SO JOURNAL OF CRYSTAL GROWTH
AB The interfacial energy between the gamma and gamma ' phase in Ni-Co base superalloy TMW-4M3 was investigated using both a kinetic analysis of experimental data and a thermodynamic analysis. The coarsening rate of gamma' precipitates during the aging treatment process was analyzed using extended Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner theory, including the contribution of a full diffusion matrix with a thermodynamic calculation. The interfacial energies calculated from the coarsening kinetics using only the diagonal components were half as large as those using the off-diagonal contributions as well. The interfacial energy with full diffusion matrix contributions is about 75 mJ/m(2) between 1373 and 1413 K. In addition, the interfacial energy was also analyzed on the basis of the extended Becker's model (EBM), and the results, which ranged from 73.9 to 76.3 mJ/m(2 ), showed good agreements with those from the coarsening kinetics. A comparison of the interfacial energy between TMW-4M3 and several Ni base superalloys indicated an identical tendency of higher interfacial energy with a larger Ti/Al ratio. The off-diagonal terms of a diffusion matrix are very important in analyzing the coarsening kinetics of gamma' and gamma/gamma' the interfacial energy estimation using the EBM is a suitable method for TMW-4M3.

TI Halo Formation During Solidification of Refractory Metal Aluminide
   Ternary Systems
SO METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND
   MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB The evolution of eutectic morphologies following primary solidification has been studied in the refractory metal aluminide (Ta-Al-Fe, Nb-Al-Co, and Nb-Al-Fe) ternary systems. The undercooling accompanying solid growth, as related to the extended solute solubility in the primary and secondary phases can be used to account for the evolution of phase morphologies during ternary eutectic solidification. For small undercooling, the conditions of interfacial equilibrium remain valid, while in the case of significant undercooling when nucleation constraints occur, there is a departure from equilibrium leading to unexpected phases. In Ta-Al-Fe, an extended solubility of Fe in sigma was observed, which was consistent with the formation of a halo of mu phase on primary sigma. In Nb-Al-Co, a halo of C14 is formed on primary CoAl, but very limited vice versa. However, in the absence of a solidus projection it was not possible to definitively determine the extended solute solubility in the primary phase. In Nb-Al-Fe when nucleation constraints arise, the inability to initiate coupled growth of NbAl3 + C14 leads to the occurrence of a two-phase halo of C14 + Nb2Al, indicating a large undercooling and departure from equilibrium.

TI Oxidation Behavior of the Niobium-Modified MAR-M247 Superalloy at 1,000
   A degrees C in Air
SO OXIDATION OF METALS
AB MAR-M247 superalloy has excellent mechanical properties and oxidation resistance. The aim of this work was to evaluate the oxidation behavior of a Nb-modified MAR-M247 superalloy (10.2 wt% Co; 10.2 W; 8.5 Cr; 5.6 Al; 1.6 Nb; 1.4 Hf; 1.1 Ti; 0.7 Mo; 0.15 C; 0.06 Zr; 0.02 B; Ni balance). The samples were subjected to oxidation tests in air at 1,000 A degrees C up to 240 h and the weight gain was measured every 24 h. The material in the as-cast condition as well as those from the oxidation tests were characterized with the aid of SEM/EDS and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The results showed that the n value and the parabolic rate constant (k) for the MAR-M247(Nb) superalloy at 1,000 A degrees C were about 0.1 and 2.8 x 10(-8) mg(2)cm(-4)s(-1), respectively. The microstructural characterization showed the formation of NiO oxides in the outer layer, Cr2O3, TiO2, CoO, (Ni,Co)Cr2O4 spinels, W20O58 and HfO2 particles in the intermediate layer and Al2O3 in the inner layer and in the gamma' depleted zone of the material.

AB Inertia welding is a common practice to join axially symmetrical parts for aero-engine applications. The shaft for a new advanced high-pressure compressor will be produced by joining the high strength superalloys INCOLOY (R) alloy 909 (Incoloy909) and INCONEL (R) alloy 718 (IN718). IN718 is the work-horse nickel-iron-chromium alloy for a variety of parts for aero-engine applications due to a good combination of relevant mechanical properties, good corrosion resistance and easy fabricability. Incoloy909 is a nickel-iron-cobalt alloy used in aero-engines due to an interesting combination of a nearly constant low coefficient of thermal expansion combined with a constant modulus of elasticity and high strength over a wide range of temperatures. Both alloys are strengthened by precipitation-hardening through additions of niobium and titanium. Ring shaped specimens of fully heat-treated Incoloy909 and IN718 are joined by inertia welding. The microstructure in the welded zone is investigated by optical microscopy and transmission electron microscopy with the focus on the Incoloy909 side. Post-weld heat-treatments (PWHT) are evaluated by microstructural investigations and by hardness measurements. The chosen PWHT is characterized by its tensile, creep and load controlled fatigue properties. The results of the mechanical tests are described in terms of the microstructural changes observed in the welded zone.

TI Solubility and ordering of Ti, Ta, Mo and W on the Al sublattice in
   L1(2)-Co3Al
SO INTERMETALLICS
AB Co-Al-W-based alloys are promising new materials for high-temperature applications. They owe their high-temperature strength to hardening by ternary L1(2)-Co-3(Al1-xWx) precipitates, which may form even though binary Co3Al is not stable. In the current work, density functional theory calculations are performed to study the solubility and ordering of the transition metals W, Mo, Ti, and Ta at the Al sublattice in L1(2)-Co3Al. The sublattice disorder is modelled with a newly parametrised cluster expansion and compared to results using special quasi-random structures. Our results for W and Mo show that the mixing energy exhibits a minimum at approximately x = 0.7. However, the computed small values of the mixing energies indicate that W and Mo atoms are fully disordered with the Al atoms already at low temperatures. For Ti and Ta we find no sizeable driving force for ordering with the Al atoms. The computed solubilities on the Al sublattice obtained are in the range of 40-80 meV/atom for W and Mo and less than 25 meV/atom for Ti and Ta. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI On the high temperature coarsening kinetics of gamma ' precipitates in a
   high strength Co37.6Ni35.4Al9.9Mo4.9Cr5.9Ta2.8Ti3.5 fcc-based high
   entropy alloy
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB The paper reports evolution of two-phase microstructure quantitatively in a high entropy alloy of composition Co37.6Ni35.4Al9.9Mo4.9Ta2.8Ti3.5. A very high-volume fraction of ordered L1(2) precipitates forms below its solvus temperature of 1156 degrees C that cannot be suppressed during quenching. The quench microstructure contains nanometric bimodal size distribution of spheroidal and irregular precipitates, both having L1(2) ordering (gamma') and a Co + Ni concentration close to 75 at. %, thus representing a stoichiometry of (Ni,Co)(3) (AI,Cr,Ta,Ti,Mo). The alloy shows hardening on aging with a peak in hardness value at 900 degrees C for 50 h of annealing. The morphology of the precipitates at this stage evolves into cuboidal shape having rounded corners with a lattice mismatch of +0.22% with the matrix. A detailed study of the coarsening behaviour of these precipitates in the matrix of complex solid solution indicates that the coarsening follows a modified LSW mechanism with estimated activation energy of 360 +/- 50 kJ/mol between 900 and 1000 degrees C. This is slightly higher than the activation energy of most of the solutes in gamma Co matrix that does not contain heavy elements like W or Re. The high-volume fraction of the precipitates together with coarsening resistance lead to an attractive high temperature strength that is higher than many of the known superalloys.

SE Advanced Materials Research
CT European Symposium on Superalloys and their Applications
CY MAY 25-28, 2010
CL Wildbad Kreuth, GERMANY
AB Aerospace gas turbine disks operate in an environment of relatively high stresses caused by centrifugal forces and elevated temperatures. Because of the strong mechanical requirements and narrow specifications of such parts not only a correct, defect free final geometry is necessary, but also a defined microstructure. Even though the microstructure evolution during thermo-mechanical processing is well studied and understood for superalloys like IN718, the influences cannot easily be described analytically. Thus simulation tools are used to assure process stability and to optimize design parameters to meet the tough requirements in aerospace industries.
   Microstructure simulation of IN718 (and other materials) is well established at Bohler Schmiedetechnik GmbH & Co KG and appreciated by its customers. The advent of the newly developed nickel-base superalloy ATI Allvac (R) 718Plus (TM) led to extensive investigations and the development of an adapted microstructure model by Bohler Schmiedetechnik GmbH & Co KG and its research partners.
   Aim of this paper is a comparison of the microstructure evolution in IN718 and ATI Allvac (R) 718Plus (TM) during the thermo-mechanical treatment of turbine disks. Influences of process temperature, strain and strain rate on the final grain size are discussed by finite element simulations with a coupled grain structure model. Experimental results from trial forgings are compared with the outcome of the microstructure simulations.

TI Hot corrosion resistance of high-velocity oxyfuel sprayed coatings on a
   nickel-base superalloy in molten salt environment
SO JOURNAL OF THERMAL SPRAY TECHNOLOGY
AB No alloy is immune to hot corrosion attack indefinitely. Coatings can extend the lives of substrate materials used at higher temperatures in corrosive environments by forming protective oxides layers that are reasonably effective for long-term applications. This article is concerned with studying the performance of high-velocity oxyfuel (HVOF) sprayed NiCrBSi, Cr3C2-NiCr, Ni-20Cr, and Stellite-6 coatings on a nickel-base superalloy at 900 degrees C in the molten salt (Na2SO4-60%V2O5) environment under cyclic oxidation conditions. The thermogravimetric technique was used to establish kinetics of corrosion. Optical microscope, x-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy/electron dispersive analysis by x-ray (SEM/EDAX), and electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) techniques were used to characterize the as-sprayed coatings and corrosion products. The bare superalloy suffered somewhat accelerated corrosion in the given environmental conditions, whereas hot corrosion resistance of all the coated superalloys was found to be better. Among the coatings studied, Ni-20Cr coated superalloy imparted maximum hot corrosion resistance, whereas Stellite-6 coated indicated minimum resistance. The hot corrosion resistance of all the coatings may be attributed to the formation of oxides and spinels of nickel, chromium, or cobalt.

TI A comparative study of plasma sprayed coatings on railway brake discs
SO SURFACE ENGINEERING
AB In the railway context, increasing the number of trains in service relies in the development of new equipment. This objective requires increased peak speeds at the expense of stronger motorisations. The axle loads are thus heavier, especially for the new double-decker trains. These parameters have significant effects on the brake system in terms of size, non-suspended masses, and therefore energies to be dissipated. The constituent materials of the friction brakes of some railway equipment (full non-ventilated steel alloy discs for the TGV, for example) hav thus reached their technological limits in terms of energy to be dissipated for fixed mass and size. It is therefore necessary to find more powerful braking designs using new materials. The Laboratoire d'Automatique et de Mechanique Industrielles et Humaines (LAMIH) has therefore decided to focus its research toward high energy full discs. This approach consists of coating the steel discs with low thermal diffusivity friction materials that have very strong and stable mechanical and tribological characteristics at high temperature. Using blown thermal plasma, the LAMIH has already tested reduced scale C38 discs coated with NiCr-Cr3C2 cermet facing an Al2TiO5 pad. Henceforth, studies relate to cobalt or nickel based superalloys obtained by the transferred plasma process with a view to making a reliable coating-substrate bond. Performance is evaluated in terms of friction factor, wear, contact temperature, and reliability.

TI Segregation and liquid density variation during solidification of
   Waspaloy alloy
SO RARE METAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING
AB The microstructure and micro segregation of Waspaloy alloy at different temperatures were investigated by SEM and EDAX associated with liquid density calculation. It is found that main segregation alloy element in Waspaloy during solidification is Ti. The content of Ti in liquid increases from 2.90% to the maximum value of 8.91% with temperature decreasing from 1360 degrees C to 1300 degrees C. Cr and Co are of negative segregation and enriched in dendrites. The lower the temperature, the lower the content of them in liquid. As the temperature decreasing and increasing of the content of Ti in liquid, the morphology of eta changes as follows: granular-->rodlike or lamellar -->blocky. Liquid density calculation shows that the liquid density is reduced with temperature decreasing but slightly arises below 1300 degrees C which is related to the precipitation of high-Ti phase of eta and MC carbides from liquid. The maximum liquid density inversion is up to 0.01406 g-cm(-1)/degrees C and the alloy is prone to macrosegregation of freckles.

TI Microstructure and Mechanical Performance of the DD98M-DD98M Single
   Crystal Superalloy Joints Brazed Using a Pd-Si Composite Filler
SO METALS
AB In this work, the DD98M single crystal superalloys were brazed to themselves using a Pd-Si composite filler. The effect of brazing temperature and soaking time on the microstructure and mechanical behavior of the joints was studied. The microstructure and phase constitution in the joint were identified by the SEM and EDS analysis. The results indicated that the joint obtained was constituted by DD98M/zone 2/zone 1/zone 2/DD98M. The zone 1 was primarily made up of the Ni (Pd, Cr, Co) (s.s), Pd4Si, Pd (Ni, Ti, Al) (s.s) and Pd-rich Ni (Pd, Cr, Co) (s.s), while the zone 2 consisted of the Ni (Pd, Cr, Co) (s.s) and Al2Pd5. During the brazing process, increasing the brazing temperature strengthened the fluidity of the liquid filler, which was favorable to eliminating the solidified pores in the brazing seam. Furthermore, a higher brazing temperature would cause the phases in the zones 1 and 2 to be coarsened remarkably. When setting the brazing temperature to 1060 degrees C, extending the soaking time made the amount of Pd (Ni, Ti, Al) (s.s) decrease, whereas the amount of Pd4Si increased, because the peritectic reaction between the Pd (Ni, Ti, Al) (s.s) and remnant liquid filler was enhanced. Among the brazing process parameters under investigation, the maximum joint average shear strength obtained reached 338 MPa when the joint was brazed at 1060 degrees C for 30 min. A ductile fracture mode happened during the shear tests under a joining condition. The work performed can provide valuable data to design the single crystal superalloy brazed joint.

TI Kinetics pathway of precipitation in model Co-Al-W superalloy
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB The early stages of precipitation of the gamma' phase in a model Co based superalloy (Co-9.1Al-7W (at.%)) have been investigated at 900 degrees C using electron microscopy and atom probe tomography. Nucleation, growth and coarsening stages have been studied with a focus on the temporal evolution of the precipitate composition in the light of recent theoretical developments on phase separation in multicomponent alloys. The experimental data have been confronted to the theories of nucleation and coarsening recently developed for such alloys, which are valid for non-ideal and non-dilute systems, and predict the temporal evolution of both the matrix and precipitate compositions. The rate constant for the mean size evolution of the particles, as derived from experiments, has been compared to the one predicted by the mentioned coarsening theory that accounts for a more accurate description of the thermodynamics of the phases, as compared with more classical approaches. From this comparison the gamma/gamma' interfacial energy was derived and found equal to similar to 48 mJ/m(2) The exponents for the temporal evolution of average particles size, number of particles per unit volume were found identical to those for binary alloys during the coarsening regime, as expected, and the temporal evolutions of compositions in both gamma and gamma' phases were found to evolve as predicted by theory. Indeed, the W content in the particles, measured from atom probe tomography (APT) experiments, was found to significantly decrease with time and the observed evolution is remarkably well described by the theory and therefore is shown to originate from the competition between diffusion and capillarity.

TI Stability of nanoscale co-precipitates in a superalloy: A combined
   first-principles and atom probe tomography study
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Inconel 718 is a nickel-iron based superalloy widely used in the aerospace industry. Its high temperature strength is attributed to the thermal stability of dense nanoscale precipitates gamma' [Ni3Al] and gamma '' [Ni3Nb]. There is experimental evidence that gamma' and gamma '' often form co-precipitates gamma'/gamma '' or sandwichlike structure gamma'/gamma ''/gamma' or gamma ''/gamma'/gamma ''. But how they stabilize under heat treatment or in service is still not well-understood. We have investigated the interfacial structure and chemistry of fine co-precipitates Ni-3(Al, Ti, Nb)/Ni3Nb(gamma'/gamma '') in Inconel 718, using both first-principles density functional theory calculation and the three-dimensional atom probe technique. Our calculations confirm that Al atoms in the gamma' phase segregate to the gamma'/gamma '' interface. The enrichment of Al helps to impede the assimilation of Nb from gamma' to gamma '' and reject Al from gamma '' to gamma', and therefore keeps such secondary precipitates at fine size. In the absence of Ti in the gamma' phase, our calculations predict an enhanced driving force for Al to accumulate at the interface. We have also characterized the microstructure of the gamma'/gamma '' interface for an Inconel 718 sample taken from a commercial compressor blade serviced in an airplane engine for over 10 000 h at a temperature up to 600 degrees C using three-dimensional atom probe analysis. Interestingly, we find that Al enrichment sustains long-term service, suggesting that the coarsening of secondary precipitates is interface-controlled. The success of first-principles density functional theory computation in reproducing the experimental observation encourages extensive application of this powerful tool in the study of precipitates in superalloys.

TI A technique for characterizing microsegregation in multicomponent alloys
   and its application to single-crystal superalloy castings
SO METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND
   MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Instrumental errors in microsegregation measurements in multicomponent alloys complicate the treatment of randomly sampled data. In this article, two new alloy-independent data treatment algorithms are presented that are capable of separating the effects of scatter in the data from the underlying segregation trends, assigning each measurement location a unique fraction solid. These new methods are physically reasonable and result in improved estimates of segregation parameters, particularly the solute partitioning at the dendrite tip. This is demonstrated by determining the microsegregation in four successive generations of single-crystal (SX) nickel-based superalloys. Artificial, noise-induced, tails commonly seen in the microsegregation profiles are also minimized. A methodology for evaluating sorting schemes is introduced that does not depend upon a priori knowledge of the partitioning direction. Comparison is made to both other sorting methods and CALPHAD predicted partition coefficients. Implications for alloy design are reported, illustrating the interaction between solute species such as Ru, Re, Co, and W.

TI OPTIMIZATION OF THE MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF THE SUPERALLOY NIMONIC 80A
SO MATERIALI IN TEHNOLOGIJE
AB The superalloy Nimonic 80A has found its major application in the production of the parts for the vehicle and airplane industries. It is a relatively expensive material and it is very important to reduce its production costs to acceptable levels. The aim of this research was to produce the superalloys with varying supplements of alloying elements.
   The investigations carried out included chemical testing and the testing of the mechanical properties of the superalloy Nimonic 80A, followed by a regression analysis of the obtained data to show the influence of certain alloying elements that can significantly affect the improvement of the mechanical properties of Nimonic 80A.
   The results of the regression analysis are the equations with which, on the basis of the known chemical composition, i.e., the content of the main alloying elements - Al, Ti and Co - the mechanical properties of the materials at increased temperatures can be predicted. On the basis of the obtained squared regression equations, an optimization of the chemical composition for the selected values of the mechanical properties was carried out.

TI Solution heat-treatment of Nb-modified MAR-M247 superalloy
SO MATERIALS CHARACTERIZATION
AB MAR-M247 superalloy has excellent mechanical properties and good oxidation resistance at elevated temperatures. Niobium is an element known as gamma' phase hardener in nickel-based superalloys, besides promoting homogeneous distribution of MC carbides. This work is inserted in a project that aims to evaluate the total replacement of tantalum by niobium atoms in MAR-M247 superalloy (10.2 Co, 10.2 W, 8.5Cr, 5.6 Al, 1.6 Nb, 1.4 Hf, 1.1 Ti, 0.7 Mo, 0.15 C, 0.06 Zr, 0.015 13, Ni balance-wt.%). Based on microstructural characterizations (SEM and FEG-SEM, both with EDS) of the as-cast material and heat-treated materials as well as utilizing Thermocalc simulations and experiments of differential thermal analysis (DTA), heat-treatment at 1260 degrees C for 8 h was chosen as an ideal condition for the solution of Nb-modified MAR-M247 superalloy. The hardness of as-cast and ideally solution treated materials was 390 +/- 14 HV and 415 +/- 6 HV, respectively. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB The principle failure mechanism in thixoforming dies is thermal fatigue as the mechanical loading on the tooling is modest owing to a mushy feedstock. Samples of X32CrMoV33 steel, Inconel 617 and Stellite 6 alloys were submitted to thermal cycling under conditions which approximate thixoforming of steels. The thermal fatigue test of the X32CrMoV33 hot work tool steel was terminated after 1500 cycles due to severe surface degradation and temper softening, both leading to a relatively poor thermal fatigue resistance, in spite of favorable thermo-physical properties. The response to thermal cycling of the Ni- and Co-based superalloys, Inconel 617 and Stellite 6, under steel thixoforming conditions, on the other hand, was encouraging. The Inconel 617 and Stellite 6 samples are much more resistant to oxidation and temper softening than the hot work tool steel, providing a superior resistance to thermal fatigue cracking with few and relatively shallow cracks after as many as 5000 thermal cycles.

TI Metal dusting and coking of alloy 803
SO CORROSION SCIENCE
AB Investigation was made by SEM examination on metal dusting and coking behaviours of alloy 803 in a flowing gas mixture of H-2-CO-H2O, It was found that an oxide scale arisen on the sample surface at the beginning of exposure, Metal dusting started when graphite deposition occurred earlier at the local defects in the oxide settle than the defects were repaired by enough supply of chromium from the interior of alloy matrix. Coke consisted of graphite filaments and metallic particles produced by disintegrating of alloy matrix, and grow up from the defects in the oxide scale with pit left in the sample surface, Increasing chromium content, doping a small amount of silicon and reducing grain size to create fast diffusion paths for chromium and silicon to alloy surface, all promote the formation of a dense oxide scale and favor early self-repairing or the defects in the oxide scale before occurrence of graphite deposition, The resistance of an alloy to metal dusting can be improved generally by means of these methods, (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The corrosion of structural alloys in Gas Cooled Reactor environment appears to be a critical issue. The coolant helium proved to contain impurities mainly H-2, H2O, CO, and CH4 in the microbar range that interact with metallic materials at high temperature. Surface scale formation, bulk carburisation and/or decarburisation can occur, depending on the gas chemistry, the alloy composition and the temperature. These structural transformations can notably influence the component mechanical properties. A short review of the literature on the topic is first given. Corrosion tests with high chromium alloys and a Mo-based alloy were carried out at 750degreesC in a purposely-designed facility under simulated GCR helium. The first, rather short term, results showed that the Mo-based alloy was inert while the others alloys oxidised during at least 900 hours. The alloy with the higher Al and Ti contents exhibited poor oxidation resistance impeding its use as structural material without further investigations.

TI HIGH TEMPERATURE OXIDATION BEHAVIOUR OF CoCrTaAlY+10%Al2O3 COATINGS
   PRODUCED BY HVOF
SO METALLURGIA ITALIANA
AB High temperature oxidation causes degradation of materials in aircraft engines. Typical coatings like MCrAlY (where M is Co, Ni or Fe) are used to prevent or retard oxidation. High Velocity Oxygen Fuel (HVOF) is a thermal spray technique used in this field.
   This work aims to characterize a reinforced CoCrTaAlY (+10% Al2O3) coating that has been thermally sprayed on CMSX-4 superalloy discs by HVOF. The samples were exposed at 1100 degrees C for long times (100-500 h) in air to develop oxidation. Interdiffusion processes were activated at high temperatures and microhardness values decreased as a function of time and distance from the surface. After 500h oxidation, hardness values in the coating were comparable to that in the matrix, with a 25% reduction compared to the pre-oxidized condition. At the same time, a strong aluminum oxide developed on the surface to protect the coating; the oxide was 5 pm thick after 96 h and higher than 12 pm after 50Ch. microstructure characterization was performed by light microscopy and SEM.

Interdiffusion behavior between the Pt-Ir films and substrates was investigated in terms of chemical composition, phase constitution and morphology. X-ray analysis revealed that annealed specimens consisted of several fcc solid solutioned phases with various lattice parameters, together with ordered intermetallic compounds (Ll(2)-(Pt,Ni)(3)Al and B2-(IrNi)Al), due to the inward diffusion of Pt and Ir from the electrodeposited films to the superalloy substrates, and the outward diffusion of solute elements (Ni, Al, Cr, Co) in the superalloy substrates into the films during annealing. The depth concentration analysis indicated that the Pt-36.1 Ir film effectively retarded the outward diffusion of solute elements, especially nickel, from the substrate.

SO MATERIALWISSENSCHAFT UND WERKSTOFFTECHNIK
AB The present paper presents a novel approach which allows a direct assessment of the creep strength of thin walled DS turbine blades at temperatures up to 1100 degrees C using a grain morphology sensitive miniature creep specimen test technique. The work builds up on earlier investigations by DeMestral and co-workers ([i] B. DeMestral et al., Met. and Mat. Transactions A, 27A (1996) pp. 879-890 and [ii] B. DeMestral and G. Eggeler, Prakt. Metallogr., 29 (1992) pp. 174-191) on the influence of grain morphology on creep deformation and damage accumulation in superalloys with elongated macrograins. The paper reports the important features of this new procedure which include (i) the creep test technique (specimen geometry and grip design) and (ii) the removal of creep specimens from a DS CM 247 LC cast blade with respect to the morphology of the macrograins. The paper also reports creep results obtained with this new technique at temperature of 1030 degrees C and a tensile stress of 180 MPa and discusses the results on the basis of the associated microstructural creep deformation and damage mechanisms.

TI Isothermal Oxidation of Aluminized Coatings on High-Entropy Alloys
SO ENTROPY
AB The isothermal oxidation resistance of Al0.2Co1.5CrFeNi1.5Ti0.3 high-entropy alloy is analyzed and the microstructural evolution of the oxide layer is studied. The limited aluminum, about 3.6 at %, leads to the non-continuous alumina. The present alloy is insufficient for severe circumstances only due to chromium oxide that is 10 mu m after 1173 K for 360 h. Thus, the aluminized high-entropy alloys (HEAs) are further prepared by the industrial packing cementation process at 1273 K and 1323 K. The aluminizing coating is 50 mu m at 1273 K after 5 h. The coating growth is controlled by the diffusion of aluminum. The interdiffusion zone reveals two regions that are the Ti-, Co-, Ni-rich area and the Fe-, Cr-rich area. The oxidation resistance of aluminizing HEA improves outstandingly, and sustains at 1173 K and 1273 K for 441 h without any spallation. The alumina at the surface and the stable interface contribute to the performance of this Al0.2Co1.5CrFeNi1.5Ti0.3 alloy.

TI A thermodynamic model applicable to liquid gamma gamma prime phase
   equilibrium in superalloys
SO CANADIAN METALLURGICAL QUARTERLY
AB A thermodynamic model has been developed to address the gamma, gamma prime and liquid phase equilibrium for dilute single crystal gas turbine alloys such as CMSX-10. The model is based on a review of the Ni-X (X = Al, Co, Cr, Re, Ta, W) binary systems where the observed binary phase diagrams are well reproduced with self-consistent thermodynamic models that incorporate, when available, measured thermodynamic properties. These models are then interpolated using the Kohler scheme to address the gamma-gamma prime equilibrium observed in the related Al-Ni-X ternary systems. The gamma and liquid phases are modelled using a substitutional solution formalism; the gamma prime phase is modelled as the stoichiometric compound Ni3Al into which are dissolved compounds of the Ni3X type. The role of coherency in superalloy microstructure and the importance of a sound knowledge of constituent binary systems are discussed. The calculated phase equilibrium compositions and phase transformation temperatures are compared to the literature data for CMSX-10.

AB An analytical transmission electron microscopy study was performed on the nature of nanosize secondary phase precipitates that form in standard heat-treated commercial nickel base superalloy IN 738. In addition to M5B3 borides and M23C6 carbides, the precipitates were found to also consist of particles of M2B-type boride phase, which is previously unreported in the alloy and rarely reported in nickel base superalloys. The M2B borides exhibited a dual crystallographic structure: body centered tetragonal and face centered orthorhombic. Analyses of electron diffraction patterns and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy images indicated that both crystal structures can co-exist in a single M2B particle as an inter-growth with the formation of planar defects. Crystallographic relationship between microconstituent phases in the heat-treated alloy were elucidated and the influence of the borides on resistance to grain boundary liquation cracking during high-temperature material processing, such as laser beam treatment, is discussed.

TI On the microtwinning mechanism in a single crystal superalloy
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB The contribution of a microtwinning mechanism to the creep deformation behaviour of single crystal superalloy MD2 is studied. Microtwinning is prevalent for uniaxial loading along (011) at 800 degrees C for the stress range 625 to 675 MPa and 825 degrees C for 625 MPa. Using quantitative stereology, the twin fraction and twin thickness are estimated; this allows the accumulated creep strain to be recovered, in turn supporting the role of the microtwinning mode in conferring deformation. Atom probe tomography confirms the segregation of Cr and Co at the twin/parent interface, consistent with the lowering of the stacking fault energy needed to support twin lengthening and thickening. A model for diffusion controlled growth of twins is proposed and it is used to recover the measured creep strain rate. The work provides the basis for a thermo-mechanical constitutive model of deformation consistent with the microtwinning mechanism. (C) 2017 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The resistance to stress-accelerated grain boundary oxygen embrittlement (SAGBO) in Fe-Ni-Co-Nb-Ti controlled low expansion superalloy has been improved by trace yttrium element addition. The platelet precipitates in the alloy have been studied by means of optical microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, convergent beam electron microscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction technique. The crystal structure and the chemical composition of the platelet phase have been determined. The phase has a CaCu5-type crystal structure (space group P6/mmm) with lattice parameters a = 0.498 nm and c = 0.408 nm. The crystallographic orientation relationship between the phase and the matrix is found to be (<(11)over bar>1)(gamma)/(0001)(H), [(1) over bar 10](gamma)/[11 (2) over bar 0](H). High-resolution images show that the interface between the platelet phase and the matrix is semicoherent and some stacking faults have been found in the platelet phase. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science S.A.

TI Cyclic Oxidation Behavior of an EB-PVD CoCrAlY Coating Influenced by
   Substrate/coating Interdiffusion
SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF AERONAUTICS
AB To reveal the influence of substrate/coating interdiffusion on the cyclic oxidation property of a metallic coating, cyclic oxidation behavior of an EB-PVD CoCrAlY coating on directionally solidified Ni-based superalloy DZ125 at 1 050 degrees C is investigated. The 40 mu m thick CoCrAlY coating has a cyclic oxidation life of around 160 h, and the oxidation constant is 1.915x10(-7) mg(4).cm(-8).s(-1). However, severe spallation of the oxides containing Co, Cr, Ni, Ta and Ti occurs with longer cyclic oxidation. The degradation in oxidation resistance for the coating is related to the depletion of Al due to the oxide spallation and interdiffusion. Severe interdiffusion between the coating and underlying substrate occurs at 1 050 degrees C. The composition of the substrate has an important effect on the thermal cycling lifetime of the coating. The influencing mechanism is discussed.

TI ANISOTROPIC CREEP IN A Ni-BASED SINGLE CRYSTAL SUPERALLOY
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB Constant load creep tests were performed on the [001] and [011] oriented Ni-Co-Cr-Mo-W-Al-Ti-Ta single crystal superalloys. The [001] oriented alloy has much longer creep life than that of [011] oriented alloy, but the elongation of [011] oriented alloy is slightly higher under the condition of 750 degrees C/750 MPa. The average creep life and elongation of [001] oriented alloy are both higher than that of [011] oriented alloy at 982 degrees C/248 MPa, and the anisotropy occurs mainly during the accelerating creep stage, but anisotropic degree decreases obviously. The SEM analysis reveals gamma' phases are rafted in the two directions, which blocks the glide/climb of dislocations and causes creep hardening, the rafting of gamma' phase is the dominant reason to decrease of creep anisotropy at higher temperature. The TEM observation indicates deformation twins formed in [011] oriented alloy, which lowers the plasticity of the sample and induces the sample to fracture rapidly.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR MULTISCALE COMPUTATIONAL ENGINEERING
AB In this article we discuss phase field modeling of dislocation reactions and network formation in fa crystals, gamma-channel filling by dislocations during plastic deformation in Ni-based superalloys, and deformation mechanisms in multilayer thin films. The phase field method is introduced in the context of gradient thermodynamics and discussed in contrast to the Peierls-Nabarro model. General expressions of crystalline and gradient energies are introduced, and their applications to various dislocation reactions leading to network formation are presented. The critical shear stress applied to drive dislocations through the gamma-channels is characterized as a function of channel width, dislocation density in the channels, and lattice mismatch. The propagation behavior of threading dislocations in a multilayer microstructure is characterized as a function of misfit strain and applied stress. Different deformation mechanisms of the multilayer microstructure are predicted, ranging from a confined layer slip in individual layers at a large lattice mismatch to a co-deformation across layers at a smaller lattice mismatch. Advantages, potential new applications, and limitations of the phase field method are discussed.

AB A common method of protecting superalloys from aggressive environments at high temperatures is by plasma spraying MCrAlY (M = Fe, Ni and/or Co) to form an overlay coating. Oxidation resistance is then conferred through the development of an alumina layer. However, the use of such coatings is limited at temperatures above about 1100 degrees C due to rapid failure of the protective oxide scales. In this study, the oxidation behaviour of air-plasma-sprayed NiCrAlY coatings has been investigated at 1200 degrees C in 1 atm air. A protective alumina layer develops during the early stages, but breakaway oxidation occurs after prolonged exposure. The results suggest that the critical temperature drop to initiate failure is inversely proportional to the scale thickness, and an analytical model is put forward to explain this behaviour. Local surface curvature of the coating can lead to delamination within the oxide during cooling and it is shown that the largest individual pore in a spall region is the critical flaw for oxide fracture.
