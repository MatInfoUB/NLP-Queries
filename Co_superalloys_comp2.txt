TI Atomic mobilities, interdiffusivities and their related diffusional
   behaviors in fcc Co-Cr-Ni alloys
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Diffusion couples for fcc Co-Cr-Ni ternary system are prepared, all of which are annealed at 1573 K for 50 h. Interdiffusion coefficients are evaluated at the intersection points of two independent diffusion paths sharing a common composition. Such main and cross interdiffusion coefficients are then used to inversely retrieve atomic mobilities of Co, Cr and Ni in fcc Co-Cr-Ni alloys, with the aid of available thermodynamic description. Further validation concerning the quality of atomic mobilities is conducted with computational simulations for diffusion couples annealed at 1573 K for 50 h, the results of which are compared with experimental data. This work contributes to the establishment of a general Co- or Ni-based kinetic database for computational design of superalloys. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Stability of TaC precipitates in a Co-Re-based alloy being developed for
   ultra-high-temperature applications
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED CRYSTALLOGRAPHY
AB Co-Re alloys are being developed for ultra-high-temperature applications to supplement Ni-based superalloys in future gas turbines. The main goal of the alloy development is to increase the maximum service temperature of the alloy beyond 1473 K, i.e. at least 100 K more than the present single-crystal Ni-based superalloy turbine blades. Co-Re alloys are strengthened by carbide phases, particularly the monocarbide of Ta. The binary TaC phase is stable at very high temperatures, much greater than the melting temperature of superalloys and Co-Re alloys. However, its stability within the Co-Re-Cr system has never been studied systematically. In this study an alloy with the composition Co-17Re-23Cr-1.2Ta-2.6C was investigated using complementary methods of small-angle neutron scattering (SANS), scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and neutron diffraction. Samples heat treated externally and samples heated in situ during diffraction experiments exhibited stable TaC precipitates at temperatures up to 1573 K. The size and volume fraction of fine TaC precipitates (up to 100 nm) were characterized at high temperatures with in situ SANS measurements. Moreover, SANS was used to monitor precipitate formation during cooling from high temperatures. When the alloy is heated the matrix undergoes an allotropic phase transformation from the "phase (hexagonal close-packed) to the gamma phase (face-centred cubic), and the influence on the strengthening TaC precipitates was also studied with in situ SANS. The results show that the TaC phase is stable and at these high temperatures the precipitates coarsen but still remain. This makes the TaC precipitates attractive and the Co-Re alloys a promising candidate for high-temperature application.

TI Friction and Wear Characteristics of Single Crystal Ni-Based Superalloys
   at Elevated Temperatures
SO TRIBOLOGY LETTERS
AB The purpose of this study was to investigate the friction and wear behavior of single crystal superalloys at elevated temperatures. Pin-on-plate experiments were conducted using a custom-built high-temperature fretting/wear apparatus. Measurements were performed on two single crystal Ni-based alloys and Waspaloy (R) (used as a baseline material). The coefficient of friction for the single crystal materials (i.e., during running-in and steady state) was lower compared to the Waspaloy (R). In addition, the experiments showed that the friction coefficient of the single crystal is dependent on the crystallographic plane; the friction coefficient was lower for the tests on the {100} plane compared to the {111} plane. The wear behavior was aligned with the friction behavior, where the single crystal Ni-based alloys showed slightly higher wear resistance compared to the Waspaloy (R). Ex situ analysis by means of FIB/SEM and XPS analysis revealed the formation of Co-base metal oxide layer on the surface of the single crystal alloy. Similarly, a Co-base oxide layer is observed on the counterface providing a self-mated oxide-on-oxide contact and thus lower friction and wear compared to the Waspaloy (R).

TI Rafting of gamma' precipitates in a Co-9Al-9W superalloy during
   compressive creep
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB The rafting of gamma' precipitates was investigated in a single crystal of Co-9Al-9W(at%) superalloy after compression creep tests at 850 degrees C. Scanning electron micrographs show that the gamma' precipitates raft perpendicular to the compressive stress axis, due to their positive lattice parameter misfit. The rafting of gamma' precipitates occurred after the minimum strain rate was reached. The dislocation structure and stacking faults were investigated by transmission electron microscopy. Dislocations preferentially moved in the horizontal gamma matrix channels where they can relieve the coherency stress at horizontal gamma/gamma' interfaces. After extended periods of creep, rafting of the gamma' precipitates perpendicular to the external compressive stress axis occurred. The merging of gamma' precipitates during rafting initiated at the precipitates corners, leaving pockets of matrix phase in the vertical gamma channels between adjacent gamma' precipitates. The necessary diffusion of alloying elements during the rafting process between the two orientations of matrix channels should be decelerated as diffusion is slower in the ordered L1(2) gamma' phase than in the disordered gamma phase.

AB The newly developed TMW (R) disk superalloy exhibits better overall mechanical properties in the intended service temperature region (650-750 degrees C) than the most advanced cast & wrought disk alloy U720Li. Clarification of the underlying mechanisms is beneficial for designing advanced superalloys. Among the TMW alloys, TMW-4M3 has the best tensile strength and creep resistance. In this study, tensile tests of U720Li and TMW-4M3 were conducted at temperatures ranging from 25 degrees C to 750 degrees C. The deformation microstructures have been investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Dislocation activity, involving anti-phase boundary (APB), was the dominant mechanism in U720Li up to 725 degrees C. However, the transition of deformation mechanisms from dislocation pairs cutting to stacking fault (SF) shearing and deformation twinning was observed in TMW-4M3. A concise model related to the increased surface energy is put forward to describe the competing mechanisms. It is found that APB energy, SF energy (SFE), and volume fraction of tertiary gamma' have important influence on the transition of deformation mechanisms. The controlling of deformation mechanism by alloy design is discussed.

TI Computational and experimental observations of welds in third-generation
   nickel-based superalloys
SO PHILOSOPHICAL MAGAZINE
AB The purpose of the present study is to introduce the weld quantitative solidification paths in the newly designed third-generation superalloys. The research has been conducted using both computational and experimental approaches. The model used the Scheil solidification relations to correlate the partitioning elements with their effects on the solidification paths. Accordingly, the k values were calculated for all the participating elements in the superalloy welds. The results of model demonstrated that these were very close to unity for austenite former elements, i.e. Ni, Co, Cr and Fe, while the other elements such as Ti, Nb and Mo displayed a significant tendency for segregation. The mathematical equations were calculated for weld solidification paths of superalloys. In all the welds, a remarkable segregation behaviour was observed, especially for Nb and Ti. The solidification path equations predicted type and amount of secondary phases. The solidification paths were compared with eutectic reactions on the basis of the Ni-Ti-C and Ni-Nb-C ternary phase diagrams. Both the experimental measurements and microstructural observations of eutectics exhibited an appropriate accordance with the solidification paths obtained by model calculations.

TI Improvement and micro-mechanism of a low expansion superalloy
SO RARE METALS
AB Chromium free low expansion superalloys Incoloy 900 series based on the system Fe-Ni-Co-Nb-Ti are precipitation-strengthen austenitic alloys with combination of very low thermal expansion coefficient and high tensile strength. The most important problem of these alloys is the susceptibility to stress accelerated grain boundary oxygen embrittlement (SAGBO) due to the absence of chromium. The oxidation resistance of the alloys after they were exposed for long time at high temperatures and the notch bar rupture strength have been improved with appropriate rare earth (RE) addition. With trace yttrium addition, the platelet precipitates become smaller and denser and the phase of precipitate transforms from epsilon phase to H phase. The crystal structures of the platelet phases in the conventional and Y-containing superalloys have been investigated and determined. The interface between the H phase and the matrix hits also been demonstrated.

TI Elemental partitioning in Ru-containing nickel-base single crystal
   superalloys
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB Single crystal nickel-base superalloys with spherical, intermediately shaped and cuboidal gamma' precipitates have been observed in Ru-containing superalloys with substantial amounts of Re and W. The gamma' precipitates experienced stress-induced directional coarsening (rafting) during creep deformation at 950 degrees C and 290 MPa indicative of a wide range of gamma-gamma' lattice misfit, which vary from negative to near-zero to positive. The precipitate morphology, lattice misfit and compositions of the gamma and the gamma' phases are interrelated, and therefore, the elemental partitioning between the phases were investigated to determine the origin of the unusual microstructural features. TEM-based EDS analysis of the gamma and gamma' phases indicate that the combination of Ru and Cr influences the partitioning of Re, which displays a wide range of partitioning behavior within the investigated alloy compositions. In alloys containing 5.7-9.6 wt.% Ru and no Cr, Re partitioned to both the gamma and gamma' phases. With high levels of Cr (6.7 wt.%) the Re strongly partitioned to the gamma matrix, while in alloys with intermediate Cr and Ru levels, the Re displayed intermediate partitioning behavior. The Ru and Co partitioned nearly equally between the gamma and the gamma' phase in all of the experimental Ru-containing alloys investigated. The degree of Cr partitioning was also similar among the alloys investigated, however, it partitioned more strongly to the gamma phase. These investigations demonstrate that Ru and Cr control the lattice misfit and precipitate shape, through the associated changes in system thermodynamics that alter the gamma and gamma' phase compositions.

AB The hot corrosion of Fe3Al and FeAl has been studied at 600-degrees-C in combustion gases and in the presence of Na2SO4-NaCl and Na2SO4-V2O5 mixtures with some additional measurements with pure Na2SO4. Under all conditions the alloys underwent significant attack with formation of scales containing both Fe and Al. However corrosion in Na2SO4 pure or mixed with NaCl slowed down significantly with time, while corrosion in Na2SO4-V2O5 mixtures was more severe, irregular and long-lasting. Except for the Na2SO4-NaCl mixture, Fe3Al corroded more than FeAl. The scales consisted always of an outer layer rich in iron oxide and an inner layer containing mostly Al but also Fe and S whose actual composition differed for the two salt mixtures. The corrosion mechanism involved to a different extent mixed oxidation-sulfidation and scale fluxing.

TI On the Development Concept for a New 718-Type Superalloy with Improved
   Temperature Capability
SO METALS
AB The superalloy 718 stands out for its excellent manufacturability and strength at ambient temperature. However, its application temperature is limited to about 650 degrees C due to the instability of the gamma '' precipitates. Here, we provide an in-depth account of an alloy development concept, allowing for the design of superalloys with 718-type properties, yet with a significantly improved microstructural stability. The article begins with a detailed discussion on how the microstructural and chemical composition must be altered to achieve this objective. Then, model alloys were used to explore and validate the outlined strategy. Finally, it is shown how these considerations ultimately led to a new 718-type superalloy with far more improved microstructural stability-namely, VDM Alloy 780. The introduction of a large amount of Co as a substitute for Fe (and partially Ni) is the most important element of our alloy development concept in terms of chemical composition. The most important microstructural feature is the introduction of low solvus temperature, high misfit gamma'-strengthening, replacing gamma ''-hardening.

TI A continuum approach to combined gamma/gamma ' evolution and dislocation
   plasticity in Nickel-based superalloys
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLASTICITY
AB In single crystal Nickel-based superalloys subject to creep loading, the gamma/gamma' phase microstructure co-evolves with the system of dislocations under load. Computational modeling thus requires multiphysics approaches capable of describing and simulating both phase and defect microstructures within a common conceptual framework. To do so, we formulate a coupled continuum model of the evolution of phase and dislocation microstructures. The simulated gamma/gamma' phase microstructure accounts for concentration as well as crystallographic order parameters. Dislocation microstructure evolution is described in terms of dislocation densities and associated stress-driven dislocation fluxes. The creep strain curve is obtained as a natural by-product of the microstructure evolution equations. We perform simulations of gamma/gamma' evolution for different dislocation densities and establish the driving forces for microstructure evolution by analyzing in detail the changes in different contributions to the elastic energy and chemical free energy density, as well as the evolution of stress concentrations that may trigger the transition from dislocation flow in the gamma channels towards shearing of the gamma' precipitates. Our investigation reveals the mechanisms controlling the process of directional coarsening (rafting) and demonstrates that the kinetics of rafting significantly depends on characteristics of the dislocation microstructure. In addition to rafting under constant load, we investigate the effect of changes in loading conditions and explore the possibility of improving creep properties by pre-rafting along a different loading path.

SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB Ni base single crystal superalloys of three kinds of Mo content were prepared by screw selecting method. The microstructures and stress rupture properties of the superalloys with 2%, 3% and 4% Mo were compared. The results showed that as-cast structures of the three alloys were composed of gamma and gamma' phases. After heat treatment, mu phase obviously precipitated and grew in the alloys with 4% Mo, while only a few p phase in the alloys with 3% Mo, and in 2% Mo containing alloy no mu phase precipitated after heat exposure to 1100 degrees C /500 h. The mu phase was mainly composed of Mo, Re, W, Cr, Co, Nb etc., in which for the tendency of forming mu phase Mo is the strongest, Re, W, Cr are the second place and Co, Nb are the weakest. A lot of precipitation of rod-like mu phases damaged high temperature stress rupture properties of alloys. Due to a few mu phase no effect on the stress rupture property and the solid solution strengthening of Mo, the optimum Mo content should be 3% for the based alloy Ni-5Cr-10Co-4W-3Re-5.6Al-8Ta-1Ti-0.5Nb.

TI Effect of Ru on the Solidification Microstructure of a Ni-Based Single
   Crystal Superalloy with High Cr Content
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB Ni-based single crystal superalloys have been widely used in manufacturing the critical components of aero-engines, such as turbine blades and vanes. Improvements in phase stability on the addition of Ru are well known in the field of Ni-based superalloy development. Cr is beneficial to hot corrosion resistance of Ni-based superalloys. Generally, superalloys which used under easy corrosion conditions should contain high levels of Cr. Early researches about the influence of Ru on solidification microstructures in Ni-based single crystal alloys are mostly focused on low-Cr systerms (<6%). Since Cr has complex interactions with Ru, it is meanful to study the effects of Ru on solidification microstructures in high-Cr (>10%) Ni-based single crystal superalloy systems. The materials used in this work are Ni-based single crystal superalloy with high Cr content. Three superalloys by changing Ru addition (0, 1.5%, 3%, mass fraction) were designed. By observing the as-cast structure, the effect of Ru on the elements distribution and the precipitation characters of different phases in these alloys were studied. It is found that as the Ru content increases, the primary and secondary dendrite arm spacings decrease gradually; the volume fraction of (gamma+gamma') eutectic increases firstly and then decreases; the gamma' size is reduced progressively. The addition of 3% Ru leads to the formation of beta-NiAl phase, which contain a certain amount of Cr, Co and Ru except the basic elements Ni and Al. The typical "reverse partitioning" of other alloying elements is exhibited with the addition of Ru, while the formation of b-NiAl phase can reduce the "reverse partitioning" of other alloying elements. The addition of Ru could enhance the segregation of positive segregation elements Ta, Al and negative segregation element Re while reduce the segregation of positive segregation elements Mo and Cr.

TI Elastic Properties of Novel Co- and CoNi-Based Superalloys Determined
   through Bayesian Inference and Resonant Ultrasound Spectroscopy
SO METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND
   MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Bayesian inference is employed to precisely evaluate single crystal elastic properties of novel gamma gamma' Co- and CoNi-based superalloys from simple and non-destructive resonant ultrasound spectroscopy (RUS) measurements. Nine alloys from three Co-, CoNi-, and Ni-based alloy classes were evaluated in the fully aged condition, with one alloy per class also evaluated in the solution heat-treated condition. Comparisons are made between the elastic properties of the three alloy classes and among the alloys of a single class, with the following trends observed. A monotonic rise in the c(44) (shear) elastic constant by a total of 12 pct is observed between the three alloy classes as Co is substituted for Ni. Elastic anisotropy (A) is also increased, with a large majority of the nearly 13 pct increase occurring after Co becomes the dominant constituent. Together the five CoNi alloys, with Co:Ni ratios from 1:1 to 1.5:1, exhibited remarkably similar properties with an average A 1.8 pct greater than the Ni-based alloy CMSX-4. Custom code demonstrating a substantial advance over previously reported methods for RUS inversion is also reported here for the first time. CmdStan-RUS is built upon the open-source probabilistic programing language of Stan and formulates the inverse problem using Bayesian methods. Bayesian posterior distributions are efficiently computed with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), while initial parameterization is randomly generated from weakly informative prior distributions. Remarkably robust convergence behavior is demonstrated across multiple independent HMC chains in spite of initial parameterization often very far from actual parameter values. Experimental procedures are substantially simplified by allowing any arbitrary misorientation between the specimen and crystal axes, as elastic properties and misorientation are estimated simultaneously.

TI Fundamental investigation of the degradation laws of aluminide coatings
   during high-temperature oxidation
SO MATERIALS AND CORROSION-WERKSTOFFE UND KORROSION
AB During high-temperature oxidation, the aluminide coating degrades by two mechanisms, one is the oxidation of the outer surface, and the other is A1 diffusion into the substrate. The relevant laws are investigated for coatings on Co-base superalloys oxidised in air at high temperatures. The driving force mainly comes from the oxidation reaction for the outer degradation layer, and the chemical potential for the inner degradation layer. By an approximation approach, it can be concluded that the life of the outward-diffusion coating is roughly directly proportional to the second power of the main-phase thickness of the coating.

TI Stacking fault effects on dynamic strain aging in a Ni-Co-based
   superalloy
SO SCRIPTA MATERIALIA
AB In this work, statistical analyses are conducted to measure the stacking fault density and stacking fault energy in a Ni-Co-based superalloy at different deformation temperatures and strain rates. High stacking fault density and low stacking fault energy indicate that the dynamic strain aging effects are caused by Suzuki segregation, which is enhanced by serious intersections of stacking faults in the superalloy. These results provide new insight into understanding stacking fault effects on dynamic strain aging in engineering alloys. (C) 2014 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

   superalloys
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB Synchronous improvement of strength and plasticity (SISP) is realized for the first time in a precipitated-phase strengthened Ni-Co based superalloy through reducing stacking fault energy (SFE). Microstructure characterizations indicate that, with lowering SFE, the dislocation slip mode transforms from wavy to planar slip, meanwhile, the twinnability is also improved. Both the planar slip mode and the increased twinnability enhance the strain-hardening capability of the superalloy, which postpones the initiation of necking. Thus, the SISP in the double-phase superalloy is achieved.

TI X-ray diffraction investigation of ordering kinetics in Ni3Al alloyed
   with a third element
SO PHYSICS OF METALS AND METALLOGRAPHY
AB The high-temperature X-ray diffraction methods were used to study the kinetics of ordering in stoichiometric Ni3Al alloyed with a third element (V,Ti, W, Nb, Cr, Co, Fe). Upon isothermal holdings at 1100, 1150, and 1200 degrees C, a "superstructure contraction" of the crystal lattice was observed. The degrees of long-range order at room temperature were determined for these alloys. Alloying with Nb, Ti, W, and V favors the retention of the high degree of long-range order in the alloy, whereas Cr, Co, and Fe added in Ni3Al decrease its value.

Interatomic potential parameters were evaluated for various additive elements, Ni, and Ni3Al so that lattice constant a, cohesive energy E-0 and elastic constants c(11) and c(12) could be reproduced. Changes of all physical quantities evaluated here were found to be proportional to the changes of concentration of additive elements. The dependencies were fitted by the linear least square method and the obtained parameters were saved as a database. The calculated slope parameters of the lattice constant were compared to measured slope parameters for various additives in the gamma phase. The measured slope parameters were reproduced very well.

SO METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND
   MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB The chemistry of the Ni-base superalloys used for turbine disks is critiqued by making use of the recently developed Alloys-By-Design computer-based tools. Compositions within the Ni-Cr-Co-Al-Ti-Mo-W-Ta(-Zr-C-B) design space are evaluated virtually. The assessment is made on the basis of sub-models for yield strength, creep behavior, oxidation resistance, and density; microstructural factors such as volume fraction and solvus temperature are considered where needed. The trade-offs between the different factors are studied in a quantitative sense. Diagrams are developed for the different alloy properties to highlight the limitations and challenges that one encounters when designing new grades of alloy or when optimizing existing grades. Composition-property maps are constructed that allow for an informed approach when defining an alloy composition. Specifically, the impact of chromium, molybdenum, and tungsten additions when mechanical behavior and lifing considerations are of concern is demonstrated.

TI DEVELOPMENT OF NI-BASED DS SUPERALLOY WITH EXCELLENT OXIDATION

SO SUPERALLOYS 2012
CT 12th International Symposium on Superalloys
CY SEP 09-13, 2012
CL Seven Springs, PA
SP TMS
AB In advanced industrial gas-turbine systems, there is a great demand for a new, excellent superalloy which can be used for large gas-turbine blades. Because it is very difficult to produce a large-scale Ni-based Single Crystal (SC) blade, we have developed new Directionally Solidified (DS) superalloys with an excellent combination of high-temperature creep strength, low-cycle-fatigue strength, good oxidation resistance, castability and hot-corrosion resistance. In this study, three kinds of Ni-based DS superalloys were designed with the aid of the d-electrons concept. The chemical compositions of these alloys were in the range of 1.4%Ti, 8.2%Cr, 11%Co, (0-1.0)%Ru, 3.6%Ta, 9.2%W, 1.0%Re, 5.2%Al, 1.40%Hf and balanced Ni in weight percent (wt%). Creep rupture tests, hot-corrosion burner-rig tests, low-cyclefatigue tests and oxidation tests were conducted with heat-treated DS specimens of these alloys. Two of the designed alloys showed the same level of creep rupture life as those of the 2nd generation DS superalloys currently in wide use. Oxidation tests at 1313K proved that the oxidation resistance of all the designed alloys was superior to that of all the reference alloys. The results of the hot-corrosion burner-rig tests showed that all the designed alloys had better corrosion resistance than the 2nd generation DS superalloys. As for Low-Cycle-Fatigue (LCF) strength, it was found that even 0.6%Ru addition greatly improved LCF strength, and the 0.6%Ru containing Alloy-B showed better LCF strength than any commercially used reference DS superalloys. A casting test was accomplished in a model bucket of a first stage blade of a 25MW-class gas turbine.
   Alloy-B is potentially a suitable alloy for making gas turbine blades with prolonged lifetimes and low maintenance costs in recent 1500 degrees C-class or even higher class gas turbines for power generation.

TI Formation of primary M6C carbide and its effect on cast die superalloys
   with high content of tungsten
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB Nickel based superalloys with high content of tungsten (W) have been applied to cast the large size die. Because the formation of large amount of primary M6C phase embrittles the die, it is necessary to explore the forming condition of primary M6C. The experiments prove that the alloys containing carbon content higher than 0.15% (mass fraction) tend to precipitate primary M6C carbide and 10% Co can restrict the formation of M6C effectively. The primary M6C forms at 1375 V. The cooling rate between the solid and liquid temperature range can influence the precipitation of this phase sensitively. Rapid cooling retard the formation of M6C obviously. The section size effect of the formation of M6C exists in castings. For a heavy section possessing dendrite spacing higher than 150 mum, it is very easy to form M6C with a millimeter magnitude, which damages the high temperature strength of alloys. To prevent the precipitation of M6C in large size section die, the composition of alloy is recommended to maintain at the level of 0.04%-0.07% C and 10%-15% Co.

TI Solidification and Segregation Behaviors with Solidification Rate in Co
   base superalloy, FSX-414
SO JOURNAL OF THE KOREAN INSTITUTE OF METALS AND MATERIALS
AB Co base superalloys have been widely used for the parts of gas turbine due to their excellent strength, thermal fatigue, oxidation resistance and weldability at high temperature. In this study, directional solidifications were carried out at various solidification rates, including 0.5 similar to 300 mu m/s in the Co base superalloy FSX-414. The cellular interface were formed at a low solidification rate, 1 mu m/s, and the dendritic interface was found at higher solidification rates, 5 similar to 300 mu m/s. As the spacing of dendrite structure decreased, the size and spacing of eutectics decreased. Dendrite arm spacing decreased with increasing solidification rates and temperature gradient. It was interesting to find the M23C6 eutectic microstructure formed between gamma dendrites. Composition analysis showed that Cr and W were segregated severely between the dendrites, which resulted in the formation of Cr-rich M23C6 and W-rich MC carbides.

AB In this study, we demonstrate the successful brazing and superior mechanical performance of laser brazed Inconel (R) 718 using a Ni-Mn-Fe-Co-Cu high entropy alloy filler metal with a nominal Ni:Cu:Co:Fe:Mn molar ratio of 1:1:1:0.25:1.75. A maximum 220 MPa shear strength is achieved. The high entropy alloy experiences the hardness increases 3-4 times after brazing. If the brazing temperature is higher than 1200 degrees C, the bonding strength suffers due to excessivediffusion between the base metal and the filler metal. The hardness behavior is attributed to a combination of the cocktail effect and lattice distortion induced by brazing. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   nickel-based superalloys with emphasis on dendritic structure
SO MATERIALS CHARACTERIZATION
AB Directionally solidified single crystal of CMSX-4 superalloy was investigated to show the evolution of microsegregation and the effect of crystal orientations on the solute distribution. As the solidification proceeded, Al, Ti, Ta and Mo consistently segregated to the residual liquid, while Co, W and Re segregated to the solidified y dendrite core. Cr did not exhibit a consistent segregation tendency to either side. Increasing the solid volume fraction resulted in increasing segregation levels of Al, Ti, Ta, Co, W and Re, whereas the segregation levels of Cr and Mo did not consistently change. For most of the alloying elements, the solute profiles of the same element were similar along the [100] and the [110] crystal orientations. For Al, Ti and Ta, the solute contents increased from the dendrite core towards its periphery. Re, W, and Co showed the opposite trend. For Mo and Cr, uniform distribution profiles were shown along the [100] orientation with increasing distance from the gamma dendrite core towards its periphery, while a large variation in the solute contents of both elements was observed along the [110] orientation. The solutes across a typical dendrite distributed more homogeneously along the [100] orientation than those along the [110] orientation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

   Ni-Based Superalloys: A Viewpoint From Interdiffusion Coefficients in
   Ni-Al-X Ternaries
SO METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND
   MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB A popular area of research in the field of high-temperature alloys concerns the search of substitutional elements for Re in order to manufacture single-crystal Ni-based superalloys with less or even no Re addition. To find the elements with similar or even lower diffusion coefficients than Re is an effective strategy. Based on 29 fcc diffusion couples in ternary Ni-Al-X (X = Re, Os, and Ir) systems, high-throughput measurement of composition- and temperature-dependent interdiffusivity matrices was performed using our recently developed numerical inverse method implemented in HitDIC software. The reliability of the determined interdiffusivities was validated by comprehensively comparing the model-predicted composition/interdiffusion flux profiles for each diffusion couple with the corresponding experimental data. Moreover, we also conducted a comparison with the interdiffusivities evaluated using the traditional Matano-Kirkaldy method as well as those from the literature and in boundary binary systems. After that, a comprehensive comparison of the interdiffusion coefficients in fcc Ni-2 wt pct Al-6 wt pct X (X = Ti, Co, Ni, Nb, Mo, Ru, Rh, Ta, W, Re, Os, Ir, and Pt) alloys at 1423 K to 1573 K was conducted. Results indicate that the diffusion rate of Re is lower than that of Os at 1473 K and 1523 K; but higher at 1573 K, while the diffusion rate of Ir is always slightly higher than those of Os and Re at 1473 K to 1573 K. Further analysis of the magnitude of the interdiffusion coefficient correlates with the alloying concentration, activation energy, atomic number, and atomic radius of different diffusing transition metal species (i.e., Ti, Co, Ni, Nb, Mo, Ru, Rh, Ta, W, Re, Os, Ir, and Pt) was conducted, which is expected to provide useful information regarding element choice in the development of new-generation Ni-based single-crystal superalloys.

TI Research on Oxidation Behavior of Novel Co-Al-W Alloy at High
   Temperature
SO RARE METAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING
AB The high-temperature oxidation resistance of Co-Al-W alloy, strengthened by a ternary compound gamma'-Co-3(Al, W) phase, was investigated. The kinetic data of mass gain and the cyclic oxidation behavior of the Co-Al-W alloys, including Co-9Al-7.5W (7.5W), Co-9Al-9.8W (9.8W) and Co-9.2Al-10.7W (10.7W), were studied at 800 and 900 degrees C by XRD, SEM and EPMA technologies, and they were compared with a nickel-base Manaurite900 (MAN900) alloy. The results show that the anti-oxidative ability of 9.8W alloy is the best at 800 degrees C among these alloys. But at 900 degrees C the square of mass gain of 7.5W and 9.8W alloys are much greater, while the anti-oxidant property of MAN900 and 10.7W alloys are superior to other alloys. The oxide scales at 800 and 900 degrees C exhibit a multi-layered structure, including an outer layer of Co3O4, an intermediate layer composed of complex oxides of Co, Al and W elements layer, and an internal attacked layer with oxides of Co and Al.

TI Interdiffusion and the vacancy wind effect in Ni-Pt and Co-Pt systems
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS RESEARCH
AB In this study, bulk and multifoil diffusion couple experiments were conducted to examine the interdiffusion process in Ni-Pt and Co-Pt binary alloy systems. Inter-, intrinsic-, and tracer-diffusion coefficients at different temperatures, and as a function of the composition, were estimated by using the experimental data. Results show that in both the alloy systems, Pt is the slower diffusing species, and hence the interdiffusion process is controlled by either Ni or Co. The thermodynamic driving force makes the intrinsic diffusion coefficients of Co and Ni higher in the range of 30-70 at.%. The low activation energy for Co and Ni impurity diffusion in Pt compared with Pt in Ni and Co indicates that the size of the atoms plays an important role. The vacancy wind effects on the diffusion process are examined in detail, and it was demonstrated that its contribution falls within the experimental scatter and hence can be neglected.

TI Effect of bonding time and homogenization heat treatment on the
   microstructure and mechanical properties of the transient liquid phase
   bonded dissimilar GTD-111/FSX-414 TLP superalloys
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Dissimilar transient liquid phase joints were fabricated between Ni-based GTD-111 and Co-based FSX-414 superalloys using a 50 mu m thick amorphous Ni-Si-B interlayer. The athermally solidified zone in the middle of joint contained the ternary eutectic of gamma/Ni3B/Ni6Si2B and few amounts of Ni3Si. The amount of eutectic phase was decreased by increasing the bonding time. The complete isothermal solidification was obtained at the joining time of 100 min. The completion of isothermal solidification was controlled by several factors including the diffusion of Si and B from the bonding zone into the base metals, the diffusion of Ti, Al, Co and Cr from the base metals into the bonding zone and proportional re-distribution of them throughout the joint. The width of bonded zone (about 80 mm) was greater than the thickness of interlayer due to the coupled diffusion and dissolution phenomena. After the homogenization heat treatment, an increase of 34% in shear strength of the joint was observed due to the uniform distribution of strengthening precipitates across the bonding area.

TI ALCHEMI studies of site occupancies in Cr-, Ni-, and Fe-substituted
   manganese cobaltite spinels
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB The effects of Cr, Ni, and Fe substitution into manganese cobaltite (MCO) spinels are of great interest due to the roles that the diffusion of these cations play in reaction layer development during high temperature exposure of MCO-coated alloys. Here we report a study on a series of model Cr-, Ni-, and Fe-substituted MCO spinel ceramics produced by consolidation of combustion-synthesized oxide powders. The cation site occupancies in these samples have been studied by X-ray spectrometry-based Atom Location by CHanneling Enhanced MIcroanalysis (ALCHEMI) experiments in the transmission electron microscope, with the data being analyzed using the ordering tie-line approach. In Cr-substituted samples, the Cr ions lie on the octahedral B sites and the Co ions reside on the tetrahedral A sites with Mn occupying the remaining sites. In Ni-substituted samples, all of the Ni ions occupy the B sites and the Co and Mn ions tend to lie on A and B sites, respectively. In contrast to the Cr-substituted samples, there is some mixing of the Co and Mn ions on the two types of sites at lower Ni contents. In Fe-substituted samples with lower Fe contents, all of the Mn ions occupy the B sites, roughly equal proportions of Fe ions occupy the A and B sites, and Co ions fill the remaining sites. With increasing Fe content, the degree of order decreases which ultimately results in the High Fe sample exhibiting no channeling evidence for preferred site occupation. These ALCHEMI data could provide a useful insight into the role of cation sub-lattice site preference in the formation of reaction layers in MCO-coated stainless steels and superalloys.

TI Effect of alloying elements in Ni-base substrate material on
   interdiffusion processes in MCrAlY-coated systems
SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB The effect of alloying elements in the substrate on the interdiffusion processes between a NiCoCrAlY-coating and model Ni-base superalloys was studied. Four single-crystal substrates Ni-10Cr-8Al-X (wt%, X = 10Co, 9Ta, 6 W) were coated with a conventional NiCoCrAlY-coating and exposed to air for up to 1000 h at 1050 degrees C. The microstructural analyses (LOM/SEM/EDX) revealed a strong dependence of the coating degradation rate on the substrate composition. The coating applied to the ternary base Ni-10Cr-8Al alloy and to the quaternary Co-containing substrate degraded most rapidly while the Ta addition to the substrate effectively suppressed interdiffusion. The degradation phenomena such as beta-NiAl depletion and propagation of the secondary reaction zone (SRZ) were interpreted in terms of a thermodynamical analysis in Thermo-Calc and by using a CALPHAD-based thermodynamic-kinetic diffusion model.

AB A multi-source ion-plasma deposition technique was used to create a series of three combinatorial libraries across the Co-Ni-Al-W-Cr-Ta composition space relevant to the formation of Co-based gamma/gamma ' microstructures. Alloys were isothermally oxidized for 1 hour in air at 1100 degrees C, and screened for Al2O3 scale formation using a high-throughput photo-stimulated luminescence spectroscopy technique. Select compositions were then analyzed in cross-section via EDS in the SEM and TEM. The resulting oxide microstructures are presented, and paths to explain their evolution are proposed. Compositions forming alpha-Al2O3 with thinner amounts of overlying oxides are highlighted. The thinnest scale observed was similar to 1 mu m, comparable to second-generation Ni-base superalloys oxidized under the same conditions.

AB The microstructural evolution of Ni-20 pct Cr wires was studied during pack cementation where Al and Ti, with and without prior cementation with Mo, are deposited to the surface of the Ni-Cr wires and subsequently homogenized in their volumes. Mo deposition promotes the formation of Kirkendall pores and subsequent co-deposition of Al and Ti creates a triple-layered diffusional coating on the wire surface. Subsequent homogenization drives the alloying element to distribute evenly in the wires which upon further heat treatment exhibit the gamma + gamma' superalloy structure. Unexpectedly, formation of cellular structures is observed at some of the boundaries between primary gamma' grains and gamma matrix grains. Based on additional features (i.e., ordered but not perfectly periodic structure, confinement at gamma + gamma' phase boundaries as a cellular film with 100 nm width, as well as lack of topologically close-packed phases), and considering that similar, but much larger, microstructures were reported in commercial superalloys, it is concluded that the present cellular structure solidified as a thin film, composed of eutectic gamma + gamma' and from which the gamma' phase was subsequently etched, which was created by incipient melting of a region near the phase boundary with high solute segregation.

TI Identification of Laves phases in a Zr or Hf containing gamma-gamma'

SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB ZrCo2 and HfCo2 Laves phases were found and characterized in gamma-gamma' Co-base superalloys using high-energy X-ray diffraction, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy. They formed during casting and are stable during long-term annealing at 900 degrees C. The ZrCo2 phase with a cubic MgCu2-type structure exhibits numerous nano-twins and stacking faults, while HfCo2 has a hexagonal MgNi2-type structure instead of MgCu2-type in contrast to literature. Their chemical compositions strongly deviated from stoichiometry and significant amounts of Al and Ware contained in these phases. These could affect the atomic radius ratio and valence electron concentration and thus change the structure of the Laves phases. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB This study focuses on investigating the microstructure and oxidation behavior of Al and Hf co-deposition diffusion coatings deposited by Pt electroplating followed by combined aluminizing and hafnizing using the pack cementation technique. The composition (in wt.%) of the packs was 2NiAl-2NH(4)Cl-xHf-(96 - x)Al2O3 with different Hf levels (x = 2, 6, 12 and 16), and the corresponding microstructure of the coatings was gamma-Ni + gamma'-Ni3Al, NiAl + Al16Hf6Ni7, Al16Hf6Ni7 and Al1.65HfNi0.35, respectively. In the post heat-treatment process, with Hf and Al diffusing towards the superalloy substrate and Ni diffusing in the opposite direction, Al16Hf6Ni7 and Al1.65HfNi0.35 were transformed into Ni3Al + Al3HfNi12 and NiAl + Al3HfNi12, respectively. The isothermal oxidation tests at 1000 degrees C in air indicated that the coating formed in the packs containing 2 wt.% Hf had the lowest weight gain, while the weight gain of the coating formed in the packs having 6 wt.% Hf was the largest. The mechanisms of Hf-rich phase formation and their effects on oxidation resistance of the coatings were discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The twin lamellae presented as three layers of overlapping stacking faults with zero overall Burgers vector. The atomic stacking sequence in the twin lamellae is consistent with pairs of parallel stacking faults at neighboring or next-neighboring glide planes. The twinning is facilitated by the low stacking fault energy of the superalloy and the lengthening of stacking faults by shear stress from nearby stacking faults. (C) 2014 Acta Materialia Inc.

   Evolution of a New gamma-gamma ' Strengthened Cobalt-Based Superalloy
SO METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND
   MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Recently, cobalt-based gamma-gamma' microstructured superalloys have attracted attention. However, studies on their processing behavior [i.e., processing maps (the variation of strain rate sensitivity (m) with temperature)] are limited. Thus, the high-temperature flow behavior of a gamma-gamma' Co-30Ni-10Al-5Mo-2Ta-2Ti-5Cr (at. pct) superalloy was investigated using isothermal compression tests between 1348 and 1498 K at strain rates from 0.001 to 10 s(-1). The m contour map was generated using the experimental flow stress values, which were used to locate the optimum hot workability and desired microstructural processing range. A strong dependence of m on the deformation parameters (temperature, strain rate, and strain) was observed. A maximum m value of around 0.3 at 1460 K to 1498 K and strain rates of 0.01 to 0.5 s(-1) was found. The deformed samples show a fully recrystallized microstructure at high m. Unstable domains showed the formation of cavities at the grain boundary triple points and cracks along the grain boundaries at high strain rates (1 to 10 s(-1)), corresponding to m < 0.10. A constitutive model was developed using an Arrhenius hyperbolic sine function, yielding an apparent activation energy of 540 +/- 30 kJ mol(-1) for hot deformation. This study indicates reasonable formability under certain conditions below the solvus, thus opening possibilities for further thermomechanical treatment.

TI High-temperature site preference and atomic short-range ordering
   characteristics of ternary alloying elements in gamma '-Ni3Al
   intermetallics
SO PHILOSOPHICAL MAGAZINE
AB Remarkable high-temperature mechanical properties of nickel-based superalloys are correlated with the arrangement of ternary alloying elements in L1(2)-type-ordered. gamma '-Ni3Al intermetallics. In the current study, therefore, hightemperature site occupancy preference and energeticstructural characteristics of atomic short-range ordering (SRO) of ternary alloying X elements (X = Mo, W, Ta, Hf, Re, Ru, Pt or Co) in gamma '-Ni3Al 21.875 X 3.125 alloy systems have been studied by combining the statistico-thermodynamical theory of ordering and electronic theory of alloys in the pseudopotential approximation. Temperature dependence of site occupancy tendencies of alloying X element atoms has been predicted by calculating partial ordering energies and SRO parameters of Ni-Al, Ni-X and Al-X atomic pairs. It is shown that, all ternary alloying element atoms (except Pt) tend to occupy Al, whereas Pt atoms prefer to substitute for Ni sub-lattice sites of Ni 3 Al intermetallics. However, in contrast to other X elements, sublattice site occupancy characteristics of Re atoms appear to be both temperature-and composition-dependent. Theoretical calculations reveal that site occupancy preference of Re atoms switches from Al to both Ni and Al sites at critical temperatures, T c, for Re > 2.35 at%. Distribution of Re atoms at both Ni and Al sub-lattice sites above T c may lead to localised supersaturation of the parent gamma '-Ni3Al phase and makes possible the formation of topologically close-packed (TCP) phases. The results of the current theoretical and simulation study are consistent with other theoretical and experimental investigations published in the literature.

TI Modeling effects of nonmetallic inclusions on LCF in DS nickel-base
   superalloys
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FATIGUE
AB Inclusions often play a dominant role in limiting fatigue life in both cast and wrought alloys under nominally elastic cyclic loading conditions. The hierarchical scales of fatigue crack formation and their correspondence to strain-life relations were considered for cast A356-T6 A1 in recent work by McDowell and co-workers using a microstructure-property framework that related cyclic plasticity near debonded silicon particle and large casting pores to formation and early growth of micro structurally and physically small fatigue cracks. In this paper, we turn our attention to the analogous role of carbides, oxides or other hard ceramic particles in fatigue crack formation in nickel-base superalloys. Cyclic plasticity of a directionally solidified (DS) nickel-base superalloy is evaluated in the [0 0 1] orientation. The effects of loading parameters (strain amplitude, R-ratio) and microstructural parameters (nonmetallic inclusion shape, spacing, etc.) on local cyclic plasticity at microstructure-scale notches are evaluated. The effect of neighboring grain orientation on intensification of plastic strain around inclusions is analyzed, and functions are determined for relating applied strain to cyclic plastic shear strain near the inclusion/matrix debond (micronotch) that contributes to LCF crack formation. Use of such a framework for predicting microstructure-dependence of fatigue crack initiation life and its variability are discussed, as are additional mechanisms of microfracture associated with cumulative plastic deformation.

TI Vacancy effect on the generalized stacking fault energy of alloyed
   gamma-Ni system: A first-principles study
SO COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB It is of great importance to explore alternative alloying elements to replace rhenium (Re) for the design of low-cost Ni-based single crystal (SC) superalloys. Due to the partitioning of Re to gamma matrix, the individual and the combined effects of the single (vacancy, Mo, W and Re) and solute-vacancy complex (Mo-Va, W-Va and Re-Va) defects on the plasticity of gamma-Ni have been studied by the first-principles calculations of generalized stacking fault energies (GSFE). It is found that a single vacancy and an alloying solute Mo/W/Re at the fault plane decreases the intrinsic stacking fault energy of Ni from 131 mJ/m(2) to 106 mJ/m(2) and similar to 97 mJ/m(2) respectively. Further reductions are made by the introduction of a solute-vacancy complex defect (similar to 80 mJ/m(2)). Furthermore, the unstable planar fault energies tuned by the Mo-Va and W-Va complex defects are almost identical, which are both slightly smaller than those by Re-Va. Finally, the calculated values of three twinnability measures elucidate that W and Mo provide similar enhancements in the twinning propensity of gamma-Ni to that by Re. This result suggests a possibility of partly replacing Re by Mo or W in Ni-based SC superalloys.

TI Precipitation behaviors of gamma ', epsilon and eta phases in
   Fe-Ni-Co-Nb based superalloys
SO TETSU TO HAGANE-JOURNAL OF THE IRON AND STEEL INSTITUTE OF JAPAN
AB An Fe-38Ni-13Co-4.7Nb-1.5Ti-0.4Si alloy (alloy 909) and an Fe-29.5Ni-19.7Co-4.0Nb-1.3Ti-0.6Al-0.4Si alloy (alloy 929) are the latest low thermal expansion superalloys. This study was carried out to elucidate the relation between the age-hardening and the precipitation behaviors of gamma', epsilon and eta phases in these alloys by micro Vickers hardness test and transmission electron microscopy.
   The results obtained in this study are as follows;
   (1) In aging at 893K hardening proceeds gradually with aging time and reaches to the maximum hardness; the hardness after aging for 720 ks in alloys 909 and 929 are HV400 and HV460, respectively. The rate of hardening increases with increaseing aging temperature. After reaching to the maximum hardness the hardness decreases gradually because of the coarsening of gamma' phase and the precipitation of epsilon and eta phases. The precipitation and growth rates of these phases in alloy 929 are lower than those in alloy 909.
   (2) The precipitation in alloy 909 follows in a sequence of supersaturated gamma phase --> gamma' phase --> Widmanstatten epsilon phase --> cellular eta phase. That in alloy 929 follows in a sequence of supersaturated gamma phase --> gamma' phase --> Widmanstatten (epsilon + eta) phases.
   (3) The main constituent elements of the epsilon and eta phases in these alloys are Ni, Co, Nb, Ti, and Fe and Ni, Nb, Co, Fe, and Si, respectively. The epsilon phase contains more Co and less Ni contents than the phase. There is no distinct difference in the composition between the Widmanstatten and cellular eta phases.

TI Experimental and Computational Study of Interdiffusion for fcc Ni-Co-W
   Alloys
SO JOURNAL OF PHASE EQUILIBRIA AND DIFFUSION
AB By means of the diffusion couple technique, electron probe micro-analyzer measurement and diffusion controlled transformation simulation, the interdiffusion behavior of ternary fcc Ni-Co-W alloys has been investigated. In the present work, the concentration profiles of fcc Ni-Co-W diffusion couples annealed at the temperatures of 1273, 1373 and 1523 K for the whole Ni-Co edge (i.e. W-poor) region of the fcc phase were measured. Based on the concentration profiles, the interdiffusion coefficients were deduced and used to assess the diffusion mobilities in conjunction with the thermodynamic description. The calculated diffusivities and experimental diffusion coefficients agree well. In addition, validation of the diffusion mobilities have been performed by further comparing the calculated concentration profiles and diffusion paths with the experiment data obtained in the present work.

AB Nickel based superalloys have good oxidation and creep resistance and hence they can function under high mechanical stress and high temperatures. However, their undesirable tribological behaviour is the major technical barrier to the challenging high-temperature, lubricant-free plasma sintering tool application. In this study, nickel based CM247 superalloy surfaces were co-alloyed using innovative active screen plasma technology with both interstitial element (e. g. N) and substitutional alloying elements (e. g. V and Ag) to provide a synergy effect to enhance its tribological properties. The tribological behaviour of the plasma co-alloyed CM247 superalloy surfaces were fully evaluated using reciprocal and pin-on-disc tribometers at temperatures from room temperature to 600 degrees C. The experimental results demonstrate that the co-alloyed surface with N, Ag and V can effectively lower the friction coefficient, which is expected to help demoulding during lubricant-free plasma sintering.

TI Development of Ni-based single crystal superalloys for power-generation
   gas-turbine blades
SO TETSU TO HAGANE-JOURNAL OF THE IRON AND STEEL INSTITUTE OF JAPAN
AB In advanced industrial gas-turbine systems, there has been a great demand for new single crystal (SC) superalloys with an excellent combination of high-temperature creep strength, hot-corrosion resistance and oxidation resistance. In this study, ten nickel-based SC superalloys were designed with the aid of the d-electrons concept. Their chemical compositions were in the range of 1.2-1.5% Ti, 3.8-6.5% Cr, 11% Co, 01.4% Mo, 6.5-7.4% Ta, 5.0-6.0% W, 3.6-5.4% Re, 5.1-5.5% Al, 0.12-0.14% Hf and balanced Ni in mass% units. A series of experiments such as creep rupture tests, burner rig tests and cyclic oxidation tests was conducted with the heat-treated SC specimens of these alloys. All the designed alloys were found to be superior in the creep rupture life to a second generation superalloy, CMSX-4. In the hot-corrosion resistance estimated from the burner rig tests, any designed alloys were comparable or even superior to CMSX-4. The oxidation resistance was very different amount the designed alloys, but some of them showed higher resistance than CMSX-4. Thus the SC alloys containing about 4-5 mass% Re had about 20 K higher temperature capability than CMSX-4, while exhibiting excellent hot-corrosion resistance and oxidation resistance.

TI Enlightening from gamma, gamma' and beta phase transformations in
   Al-Co-Ni alloy system: A review
SO CURRENT OPINION IN SOLID STATE & MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Alloys based on the ternary Al-Co-Ni system have found their broad applications in high-temperature structural materials as well as functional materials due to the existence of three major phases-gamma, gamma', beta and the phase transformations between them. The knowledge of phase equilibria and fundamental understanding of phase transition behaviors are of great importance to the research and design of industrial Al-Co-Ni alloys. This paper provides a comprehensive review and discussion of recent progresses in Al-Co-Ni system including the phase equilibria investigations, catalytic properties, shape memory effect and mechanical properties of Al-Co-Ni alloys consisting of different intermetallic phases. The differences between experimental determinations of the phase equilibria and calculated results using CALPHAD method and first-principles based thermodynamic model are evaluated, where the existence of Nishizawa horn is also discussed. Finally, prospective research topics in Al-Co-Ni alloys regarding further experimental and theoretical studies are proposed. The review provides general references and suggestions for developing novel Ni-based alloys with desired microstructure and performance through phase transformations.

TI Comparison of oxidation resistance of NiCoCrAlTaY-coated and -uncoated
   Mar-M247 superalloys in the air at 1150 degrees C
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Oxidation resistance of NiCoCrAlTaY coated and uncoated Mar-M247 superalloys were compared experimentally in the air at 1150 A degrees C. It was found that the oxidation behavior of the NiCoCrAlTaY coated and uncoated Mar-M247 superalloys generally followed the parabolic kinetics with the rate of 1.5 and 9.8 x 10(-3) mg(2)/cm(4) h for each one. Microstructural observation and elemental analysis indicated that after 200 h the uncoated alloy covered with an oxide scale of 6-10 times thicker than the coated one, beneath which a fairly continuous and relatively thin alpha-Al2O3 could be found along the interface close to the substrate. Comparatively, the NiCoCrAlTaY coated alloy uniformly produced the continuous, dense and thick alpha-Al2O3 layer adhesive to the coating to prevent the metal elements against excessive oxidation, and finally formed the steady oxide scales: outer (Ni, Co)(Al, Cr)(2)O-4 spinels, NiO, (Al, Cr)(2)Ni-3; inner protective alpha-Al2O3 with a little Cr2O3. On the surface of the uncoated alloy, however, it mainly formed the Ni-rich oxides in which a large quantity of cracks propagated to result in the more oxidation.

TI Microstructural characterisation of oxide formation from MCrAlY coatings
   on nickel-based superalloys
SO MATERIALS AT HIGH TEMPERATURES
AB Nickel-based superalloys are commonly used in industrial gas turbine engines for power generation due to their ability to withstand the arduous environments. Coating systems are employed to increase the service life of components by increasing the oxidation/corrosion resistance and high temperature capabilities. MCrAlY coatings are a common coating system used, not only to protect the substrate from oxidation and corrosion but also to act as a bond coat for thermally insulating coatings. The 'M' in the MCrAlY coatings is generally Ni, Co or a mixture of the two, with Co being added to improve the hot corrosion resistance (in conjunction with Cr) and to make the coatings more ductile. These coatings work by forming oxides that act as protective layers against further oxidation (known as tire thermally grown oxide, TGO). Alumina is most commonly formed oxide from the MCrAlY bond coat, which acts as a reservoir of elements for the oxide formation.
   It is necessary to understand the formation and nature of the TGO as a function of composition variation in the coating. This mechanistic understanding can be used to inform modelling methodologies for both service life prediction and the development of new coatings. This research is therefore concerned with the effect of compositional changes in the MCrAlY coating and their effect oil the TGO formation. Various ageing temperatures and times have been Studied, representative of service conditions. The alumina layer has been studied, however, the formation of other oxides, including isolated spinels, has been characterised in detail. Microstructural observations were carried out using scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray analysis and electron backscattered diffraction. Higher resolution characterisation was carried Out using a dual beam focused ion beam scanning electron microscope for site specific TEM preparation and STEM/TEM for microstructural evaluation. The results are then discussed in the light of both the bond coat composition and ageing conditions.

   Co-base superalloys in the Co-W-Al-Ti quaternary system
SO INTERMETALLICS
AB A continuous gamma/gamma' two-phase field has been identified extending between the ternary Co-Al-W system to the binary Co-Ti system. The lattice misfits of two phase gamma/gamma' alloys from the Co-Al-W-Ti quaternary system were measured by X-ray diffraction and found to be positive and vary linearly with composition. Differential scanning calorimetry measurements showed that the solidus and liquidus temperatures decrease from the W and Al rich end to the Ti rich end, whilst the gamma' solvus temperature increases. Long term heat treatments identified the occurrence of discontinuous precipitation at the grain boundaries in many of the alloys studied. The high temperature strength and creep resistance of the quaternary alloys in the intermediate composition range surpassed those of the binary and ternary alloys. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

   elements on gamma/gamma ' interface
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB A first-principles approach is proposed to investigate the partitioning behaviors of the alloying elements Re, Co, and Cr, and the influence of Ru and Ir addition on them. The results show that Re, Co, and Cr all partition strongly to the gamma matrix. The Ru addition decreases the gamma phase partitioning trend of Re, Co, and Cr. The results are consistent with the early experimental work. Besides Ru, Ir results in Re less strongly partitioning to gamma. Our study shows that the influence of Ru (or Ir) on the partitioning characteristics of alloying elements originates from the strong interactions between Ru(Ir)-Re-Ni through the d-d orbitals hybridization.

TI Interdiffusivities and atomic mobilities in FCC Co-Mo-W alloys
SO CALPHAD-COMPUTER COUPLING OF PHASE DIAGRAMS AND THERMOCHEMISTRY
AB By employing six groups of bulk diffusion couples together with electron probe microanalysis technique, the composition dependence of ternary interdiffusion coefficients in Co-rich fcc Co-Mo-W alloys at 1373 K was determined via the Whittle and Green method. The experimental interdiffusion coefficients were critically assessed to obtain the atomic mobilities of Co, Mo and Win fcc Co-Mo-W alloys by using the DICTRA (Diffusion-Controlled TRAnsformations) software package. Comprehensive comparisons between the calculated and experimental data show that a good agreement is obtained for diffusivities in binary Co-Mo and ternary Co-Mo-W systems. In addition, a further verification of the obtained atomic mobilities was carried out through comparing the model-predicted concentration profiles/diffusion paths of several diffusion couples with the corresponding experimental data. The results indicate that the atomic mobilities can reproduce the experiment data reasonably well. This work contributes to the establishment of a Co-based kinetic database for computational design of superalloys. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Segregation of alloying elements to planar faults in gamma'-Ni3Al
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB Systematic first principles calculations are performed to determine the interaction energies between solutes (Co, Cr, Nb, Ta) and stable stacking faults in gamma'-Ni3Al. Our results show that there is no obvious driving force for segregation to already formed SISF, SESF, or twin boundaries, which is in contrast to direct experimental evidence for segregation as provided by high spatial resolution structure and chemical analysis using scanning transmission electron microscopy techniques. This apparent discrepancy provides evidence for possible formation mechanisms of these planar faults via metastable precursor structures that are found to be attractive for solutes. In addition, we study the underlying reasons for the segregation in terms of size and chemical mismatch and find that a favorable change in bonding environment, rather than the solute misfit volume, dominates the solute/fault interaction energy.

TI Hot Corrosion Behavior of Plasma and HVOF Sprayed Co- and Ni-Based
   Coatings at 900 degrees C
SO PROTECTION OF METALS AND PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY OF SURFACES
AB High temperature Co- and Ni-based metallic coatings were applied on samples of 310 stainless steel using plasma spray and high velocity oxy fuel (HVOF) methods. The samples were sprayed with Na2SO4, V2O5 and NaCl salt solutions and exposed in air at 900A degrees C to cyclic conditions with an aim to simulate an environment typically encountered in oil refinery operation. Extent of hot corrosion damage was assessed using gravimetric measurements while microstructure of the coatings was examined using scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. X-ray diffraction was used to determine phase constitution. The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the performance of specific coatings in hot corrosive environments. Experimental results indicate that the presence of V2O5 and NaCl serves to enhance hot corrosion while Co-based coatings perform better than Ni-based coating.

TI Directional Diffusion and Influencing Factors of Elements during Creep
   of Nickel-Base Single Crystal Superalloys
SO RARE METAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING
AB By means of calculating the elements diffusion mobility and gamma'-phase directional coarsening rate of Ni-Cr-Co-W-Mo-Al-Ta single crystal superalloys with different compositions, the effect of element reaction on the rate of element diffusion and gamma'-phase directional coarsening was studied. Results show that during the gamma'-phase directional coarsening period, the rafted rate of gamma'-phase changes with composition and stress, and the rafted time is decreased with the stress increasing. The driving force of the elements diffusion and gamma'-phase directional coarsening during tensile creep are related to the applied stress and elastic modulus. Element reaction has effect on the diffusion rate of Al. As the total content of Ta+Mo and the ratio of Ta/W increased, the diffusion activation energy of Al is increased and diffusion rate decreased, and the rafted time of gamma'-phase is elongated. In the diffusion field of gamma'-phase directional coarsening, the formation of gamma'-order phase is attributed to the concentration of the atoms Al and Ta, which is a spontaneous process of the decreased free energy. The Al, Ta atoms with bigger radius are diffused to {100} planes to form the stable arranging order and the linking bond of the atoms with different kinds, which is a main reason of gamma'-order phase formation with Ll(2) structure.

TI Interdiffusion and Growth of the Phases in CoNi/Mo and CoNi/W Systems
SO METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND
   MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Deleterious topological-closed-packed (tcp) phases grow in the interdiffusion zone in turbine blades mainly because of the addition of refractory elements such as Mo and W in the Ni- and Co-based superalloys. CoNi/Mo and CoNi/W diffusion couples are prepared to understand the growth mechanism of the phases in the interdiffusion zone. Instead of determining the main and cross-interdiffusion coefficients following the conventional method, we preferred to determine the average effective interdiffusion coefficients of two elements after fixing the composition of one element more or less the same in the interdiffusion zone. These parameters can be directly related to the growth kinetics of the phases and shed light on the atomic mechanism of diffusion. In both systems, the diffusion rate of elements and the phase layer thickness increased because of the addition of Ni in the solid solution phase, probably because of an increase in driving force. On the other hand, the growth rate of the mu phase and the diffusion coefficient of the species decreased because of the addition of Ni. This indicates the change in defect concentration, which assists diffusion. Further, we revisited the previously published Co-Ni-Mo and Co-Ni-W ternary phase diagrams and compared them with the composition range of the phases developed in the interdiffusion zone. Different composition ranges of the tcp phases are found, and corrected phase diagrams are shown. The outcome of this study will help to optimize the concentration of elements in superalloys to control the growth of the tcp phases.

TI Microstructure and oxidation behavior of Al plus Si co-deposited
   coatings on nickel-based superalloys
SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB Diffusion coatings have been widely used to metallic protective coatings or bond coats in thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) to protect the aeronautical turbine blades from detrimental oxidation and hot corrosion. However, degradation of these coatings caused by oxidation or hot corrosion can be particularly severe and rapid in the operating environment of the turbine. We present an experiment to modify gamma-Ni + gamma'-Ni3Al coating by co-deposition of Al and Si in order to improve the performance of coatings. In this study, microstructure and oxidation behavior of Al and Si co-deposited diffusion coatings were investigated. These coatings were deposited by Pt electroplating followed by aluminization and siliconization using the pack cementation process. The composition (in wt.%) of the packs was 2Al-4NH(4)Cl-xSi-(94 - x)Al2O3 with different Si contents (x = 4, 6, 8 and 10) and the corresponding microstructure of the coatings was delta-Ni2Si. The isothermal oxidation tests at 1000 degrees C in air indicated that the coating formed using the packs containing 10 wt.% Si had optimal oxidation resistance. After oxidation, the microstructure of the coatings was that of Cr2NiO4 + NiO or NiO + Al2O3. The mechanisms through which Si-rich coating forms and protects against oxidation are discussed.

TI THE CRITICAL RESOLVED SHEAR-STRESS OF GAMMA'-STRENGTHENED NICKEL-BASED
   SUPERALLOYS WITH GAMMA'-VOLUME FRACTIONS BETWEEN 0.07 AND 0.47
SO ACTA METALLURGICA ET MATERIALIA
AB Gamma'-strengthening of four nickel-based superalloys has been investigated theoretically and experimentally. The critical resolved shear stress (CRSS) of under- and of peak-aged single crystals has been measured as a function of the radius and of the volume fraction f of the gamma'-particles. f ranged from 0.07 to 0.47. The observed variation of tau(p) (= contribution of the gamma'-particles to the CRSS) with f cannot be described by current models of gamma'-strengthening. The reason is an apparent increase of the gamma'-antiphase boundary energy gamma with f. This variation of gamma with f is tentatively interpreted as being due to the recently reported inhomogeneity of the composition of the gamma'-particles: their outer layers are relatively poor in Ni and Al and relatively rich in Co and Cr. If current models of gamma'-hardening are modified to allow for the variation of gamma with f, these models lead to satisfactory descriptions of the experimental data.

TI Modes of tool deterioration during milling of 718Plus superalloy using
   cemented tungsten carbide tools
SO WEAR
AB Understanding the detailed progression of cutting tool deterioration is important in order to improve the milling of Ni-based superalloys. Therefore, a series of documented experiments have been conducted on alloy 718Plus using cemented carbide (WC-Co) tools. It has been observed that the commonly recognised build up layer in the initial stage does not significantly affect the tool deterioration process. Instead, from the beginning of milling, cutting forces/stresses could cause small chipping locally in the initially sharp cutting edge. Fracturing locally with cracks propagating outside the cutting edge along the flank face in the subsurface region could also take place and was consistent with the direction of the cutting force. There was an initial period of time during which a number of microcracks had initiated in and near the cutting edge on the rake face side. These cracks soon propagated resulting in extensively fracturing and blunting of the tool. Coating of the tools had provided little protection as in the cutting edge area the coating had broken away soon after milling started. The major tool failure mode was Co binder material having heavily deformed to fracture, separating the WC grains. Loss of strength in binder material at cutting temperatures is discussed.

TI Influence of high-temperature protective coatings on the mechanical
   properties of nickel-based superalloys
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB The low-pressure plasma spray coating process has been established in the field of gas turbines and is used for hot parts, such as turbine blades and duct segments, which are exposed to corrosive gases at high temperatures. Overlay coatings based on the MCrAlY alloy system (M is Ni, CO or both) are commonly employed as oxidation- and corrosion-resistant coatings. Mechanical properties, such as creep and fatigue lives, of various MCrAlY coating systems were investigated at high temperature as compared with the uncoated substrates, such as eqiaxis IN738LC, directional solidified CM247LC and single-crystal CMSX-2. It was clear that the MCrAlY coatings had no significant influence on the creep lives of substrates for the sake of superior ductility of MCrAlY coatings at high temperature. The low-cycle fatigue lives of MCrAlY coated superalloys at high temperature showed only a little superior performance in comparison with the uncoated results. However, the high-cycle fatigue lives of MCrAlY coated superalloys at high temperature showed inferior performance in comparison with the uncoated results. It was because that the low-cycle fatigue cracks initiated at casting cavities inside the substrate in both the coated and the noncoated cases. However, the high-cycle fatigue cracks initiated at interface defects, such as small pores and grit residues, between the MCrAlY coating and the substrate and grew into the MCrAlY coating, and then into the substrate.

TI INFLUENCE OF MELT SUPERHEATING TREATMENT TEMPERATURE ON SOLUTE
   DISTRIBUTION BEHAVIOR OF A NEW Ni-BASED SINGLE CRYSTAL SUPERALLOYS
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB Solute partition coefficient plays an important role in determining the microstructure and mechanical properties of Ni-based superalloys. Melt superheating treatment can greatly affect the melt structure and redistribution of solute atom in the melt. However, up to date, there are few investigations of the influence of melt superheating treatment on the solute partition coefficient, especially for the new-generation Ni-based single crystal super alloy with additions of Re and Ru. Therefore, in this work, the influence of melt superheating treatment temperature on the solute partition coefficient of a new Ni-based single crystal superalloy with Re and Ru elements under planar solid/liquid (S/L) interface under directional solidification conditions was systematically investigated by using EPMA. It was found that the distribution of solute elements, such as Al, Ta, Ru, Re, W, Co, showed remarkable change in both sides of the S/L interface with increasing melt superheating treatment temperature, but there was little change for the solute elements of Mo and Cr. With increasing the melt superheating treatment temperature, the concentration of solute elements for Al and Ta increased firstly and then decreased, but it showed an opposite trend for Re, W, Ru and Co. Additionally, the change of the solute partition coefficients for Ru, Co, Mo and Cr were small with increasing the melt superheating treatment temperature. The main reasons related to the above changes can be ascribed to that the variation of melt superheating treatment temperature affects the size of the atom clusters in melt, which gives rise to the variation of atomic distribution, and thus leads to the change of solute partition coefficients.

Investigation has performed in the range of temperature 25...800 degrees C and hydrogen pressure up to 70 MPa. By the 3D visualization of crack morphology it has been discovered the structure of fatigue crack surface and established the refer points on crack path, including the boundary between the matrix and intermetallic particles (400x200 mu m), crack opening, structural elements distributions on the surface for selection of next local areas for more precision fracture surface and TEM examinations. Hydrogen influence on cyclic crack resistance parameters appears in the decreasing of loading cycles number (with amplitudes 15 MPa) in hydrogenated specimens of both alloys and increase with hydrogen concentration.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MATERIALS RESEARCH
AB Phase equilibria in the Co-Fe-Ti ternary system were investigated by means of the equilibrated alloy method with X-ray powder diffraction and electron probe microanalysis. No ternary compounds were found. The experimental results indicated the existence of seven two-phase and one three-phase regions at 600 degrees C, five two-phase and two three-phase regions at 800 degrees C, and six two-phase and two three-phase regions at 950 degrees C. The solubility of Co in TiFe2 was determined to be larger than 54 at.% at all investigated temperatures, and the solubilities of Fe in TiCo3 and Ti2Co showed an appreciable increase with increasing temperature. The three-phase equilibrium in the Ti-rich corner at 800 degrees C was revealed to be ((beta-Ti) + Ti(Fe, Co) + Ti2Co) rather than ((alpha-Ti) + Ti(Fe, Co) + Ti2Co) reported in previous investigations. Based on the experimental data obtained in the present work, three isothermal sections at 600, 800 and 950 degrees C were established.

AB In advanced industrial gas-turbine systems, there has been a great demand for new single crystal (SC) superalloys with an excellent combination of high-temperature creep strength, hot-corrosion resistance and oxidation resistance. In this study, 12 nickel-based SC superalloys were designed with the aid of the d-electrons concept. Their chemical compositions were in the range of 1.2-1.5%Ti, 3.8-6.5%Cr, 11%Co, 0-1.4%Mo, 0-3.0%Ru, 6.5-7.4%Ta, 5.0-6.4%W, 3.6-5.4%Re, 5.1-5.5%Al, 0.12-0.14%Hf and balanced Ni in wt%. A series of experiments such as creep rapture tests, burner rig tests and cyclic oxidation,tests were conducted with the heat-treated SC specimens of these alloys. Almost all the designed alloys were found to be superior in creep rupture life to a second generation superalloy currently used in the world. For hot-corrosion resistance, estimated from the burner rig tests, any of the designed alloys were comparable or even superior to a second generation superalloy. The. oxidation resistance was very different among the designed alloys, but some of them showed better resistance than the second generation superalloy. Thus the SC alloys containing about 4-5 wt%Re had about 30 degrees C or more higher temperature capability than the second generation superalloy, while exhibiting excellent hot-corrosion resistance and good oxidation resistance.

AB With rising operating temperatures of gas turbines, interdiffusion may occur between the structural material of the blades (superalloy) and the corrosion-resistant layer (MCrAlY) leading to premature coating failure. Depositing a diffusion barrier between the base material and the layer is a conceivable means to suppress this diffusion. alpha-Al2O3 appears to be well suited as a diffusion barrier since it passes through no phase transition at high temperatures and possesses a hcp crystal structure with a very small number of defects. However, chemical vapor deposition of alpha-Al2O3 is known to be difficult because of preferred whisker formation due to the high contents of Ni and Co in the substrate. In this paper two ways to suppress the growth of whiskers and to deposit smooth alpha-Al2O3 films on nickel base superalloy substrates are presented. Furthermore, the efficiency of the diffusion barrier was tested by annealing experiments at 1100 degrees C for 100 h. The alpha-Al2O3 films remained dense and very effective as a diffusion barrier.

TI INFLUENCE OF SEGREGATION ON LIQUID DENSITY IN THE MUSHY ZONE OF DZ483
   Ni-BASED SUPERALLOY
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB Ni-based superalloys have been widely applied in advanced aeroengine as gas turbine blades and vanes. The freckles in superalloys formed during directional solidification have deleterious influence on the properties of the alloys. The generation of freckles is associated with the local liquid density gradient in the mushy zone, which is obviously influenced by microsegregation of alloy elements. However, the individual contributions of the various elements to the total density variation are still not well known. Therefore, the effect of microsegregation on the liquid density variation in DZ483 Ni-based superalloy was investigated by isothermal solidification together with liquid quench method. Solidification microstructures were observed by optical microscope and SEM, and the compositions of the solids and the residual liquid were determined by EDS. Based on the compositions of residual liquids; the densities of liquids at different temperatures were calculated. The results show that the onset solidification temperature of DZ483 alloy is a little bit below 1335 degrees C; and MC, which is enriched with Ta and Ti, formed at about 1325 degrees C. The segregation coefficients of different elements show that W and Co are negative segregation elements, Ta and Ti positive segregation elements, while Al and Cr show little segregation. The density of the residual liquid generally decreases as the decrease of temperature, with the exception that it increases somewhat from 1325 to 1315 degrees C. Calculation results show that temperature has insignificant influence on liquid density, and variation of density is mainly due to rnicrosegregation. Segregations of Mo and Ta lead to the increase of density, but segregations of Ti and W present opposite effect. Contribution of each element to the variation of the liquid density is analyzed. The sequence of contributions of alloy elements to the variation of total liquid density is Ti>Ta>W>Cr>Mo>Al>Co. The formation of MC consumes an abundant of Ti and Ta, resulting in the increase of liquid density from 1325 to 1315 degrees C.

TI Suzuki segregation in Co-Ni-based superalloy at 973 K: An experimental
   and computational study by phase-field simulation
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB Suzuki segregation in Co-Ni-based superalloys is of longstanding interest. In this study, the development of widely extended stacking fault (SF) ribbons was confirmed in a Co-Ni-based superalloy aged at 973 K after deformation at room temperature, which supports the decrease in stacking fault energy (SFE) due to Suzuki segregation. In addition, the plastic deformation behaviors of Co-Ni-based superalloys with various Nb contents up to 3 wt.% were investigated focusing on the effect of Nb addition on dynamic strain-aging by Suzuki segregation. The negative strain-rate dependence of flow stress due to dynamic strain-aging became more significant with increasing Nb content; however, attempts to detect segregating elements by scanning transmission electron microscopy and energy-dispersive spectroscopy analysis were not successful. A phase-field simulation of Suzuki segregation suggested strong Ni depletion with segregation of Cr and Mo atoms at the SF, and the SFE can become negative as a consequence of the segregation. This agrees with the experimentally observed formation of wide SFs by the aging at 973 K after cold deformation. It is also suggested that Nb atoms are strongly depleted at SFs, and a small amount of Nb addition dramatically enhances Cr segregation, resulting in further decreases in the SFE, which is probably responsible for the observed enhancement of dynamic strain-aging by Nb addition. In addition, the local structural changes, such as short-range ordering and/or an in-plane ordering, accompanying the segregation were discussed as possible additional mechanisms for strain-aging enhancement.

TI Critical evaluation and thermodynamic modeling of the Al-Co-Fe system
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB An understanding of the thermodynamic and phase diagram data for the Al-Co-Fe system is essential for Co-based superalloys as well as high entropy alloys. In this study a thermodynamic assessment of the entire Al-Co-Fe system has been made according to the CALPHAD method after a critical review of the relevant literature data. The order-disorder model has been adopted to describe the A1/L1(2) and A2/B2 phase relations, respectively. Thermodynamic interaction parameters have been optimized, considering the available experimental data, especially about the complex equilibria arising from the interaction between chemical and magnetic ordering in the A2 and B2 phases. Several isothermal and vertical sections have been calculated and discussed in comparison with experimental results in the whole composition range. A satisfactory agreement was obtained.

AB Laser engineered net shaping (LENS) is an additive manufacturing process that presents a promising method of creating or repairing metal parts not previously feasible with traditional manufacturing methods. The LENS process involves the directed deposition of metal via a laser power source and a spray of metal powder co-located to create and feed a molten pool (also referred to generically as Directed Energy Deposition, DED). DED technologies are being developed for use in prototyping, repair, and manufacturing across a wide variety of materials including stainless steel, titanium, tungsten carbide cobalt, aluminum, and nickel based superalloys. However, barriers to the successful production and qualification of LENS produced or repaired parts remain. This work proposes a finite element (FE) analysis methodology capable of simulating the LENS process at the continuum length scale (i.e. part length scale). This method incorporates an element activation scheme wherein only elements that exceed the material melt temperature during laser heating are activated and carried through to subsequent analysis steps. Following the initial element activation calculation, newly deposited, or activated elements and the associated geometry, are carried through to thermal and mechanical analyses to calculate heat flow due to radiation, convection, and conduction as well as stresses and displacements. The final aim of this work is to develop a validated LENS process simulation capability that can accurately predict temperature history, final part shape, distribution of strength, microstructural properties, and residual stresses based on LENS process parameters.

   MATERIALS PROCESSING SCIENCE
AB The molar volume of nickel and the partial molar volumes of Cr, Co, W, Ta, Al, Mo, and Re are computed from the densities of liquid nickel and liquid Ni-based binary alloys measured by the modified sessile drop method (MSDM) and the modified pycnometric method (MPM). The molar volumes of Hf, Nb, and Ti are calculated from the literature density values of these elements. A prediction model for the densities of liquid Ni-based alloys is developed based on the obtained molar/partial molar volumes of the elements in liquid Ni-based alloys. The validity of this model is verified by the density data of liquid Ni-based ternary (Ni-Co-Al), quaternary (Ni-Co-Al-Cr, Ni-Co-Al-Mo, and Ni-Cr-Al-Mo), and commercial alloys measured by both MSDM and MPM. It is also verified by the density values of liquid Ni-based commercial alloys in the literature. It has been shown that the present model can provide reasonable estimation for the density and its temperature dependency of liquid Ni-based alloys. The difference between the predicted value and the measured/cited value is within +/- 2.5 pct.

TI The dual-species model study of co-enrichment of trace elements and Ni
   at Ni3Al grain boundary
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB The dual-species model is based on the Monte Carlo simulation conjoined with the embedded atom method (EAM) potentials. The model suggests that during relaxation of Ni-3 Al grain boundary, the trace element atoms can be seen not only as segregating species but also as inducing species. As segregating species the trace element atoms segregate (or enrich) to the grain boundary, but as inducing species they induce Ni atoms to segregate (or enrich) to the grain boundary. Evidently, the model can explain why the trace element atoms and Ni atoms co-segregate (or co-enrich) to the grain boundary. According to combination of positive (as inducing species) and negative (as segregating species) effects, the model explains the most obvious Ni-enrichment phenomenon at Ni-3 Al grain boundaries.

TI Carbides in Co-Re-Cr-based high-temperature alloys
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Co-Re-base alloys with very high melting point are being developed to supplement Ni-superalloys in future gas turbines in which much higher gas entry temperatures are expected. The microstructure of Co-17Re-23Cr-2.6C and Co-17Re-23Cr-1.2Ta-2.6C alloys has been investigated by scanning and transmission electron microscopy. These alloys are mainly strengthened by carbides of Cr and/or Ta, but it is not trivial to accurately quantify the composition of the carbides. The compositions of the various carbides in Co-Re-base alloys were quantified with near-atomic resolution using atom probe tomography. The Cr as well as Ta carbides exists in the alloys with different morphologies, ranging from extremely fine (nm scale) to large (mu m scale) sizes. The composition and the crystal structure of the investigated phases were measured and reported. It is shown that both types of carbides are stable up to 1000 degrees C but the Ta carbides are more stable than the Cr carbides at 1200 degrees C after long-time ageing. They are also effective as strengthening precipitates.

TI Strain-induced martensitic transformation near twin boundaries in a
   biomedical Co-Cr-Mo alloy with negative stacking fault energy
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB Biomedical Co-Cr-Mo (CCM) alloys have been commonly used for artificial hip and knee joint prostheses, but a need to improve their biomedical inertness and wear resistance has become widely recognized. The mechanical behavior of CCM alloys is dominated by strain-induced martensitic transformation (SIMT), which causes crack initiation during plastic deformation but dramatically enhances the wear resistance in practical use. To develop more reliable CCM alloys it is essential to clarify the factors affecting the occurrence of SIMT. In the present study we have focused on the effect of annealing twin boundaries (ATBs) on SIMT behavior. We have analyzed in detail the substructures near a parallel pair of ATBs after deformation under a stress preferential for slip parallel to the ATBs. Preferential formation of epsilon-hexagonal close-packed (HCP) phase at ATBs in metastable gamma-face-centered cubic (FCC) phase was found by both scanning electron microscopy with electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) analysis and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). High resolution TEM images indicated that thickening of the epsilon-HCP phase does not proceed regularly on every second atomic plane, which would form perfect epsilon-phase HCP structure, but irregularly leaving a high density of stacking faults. Furthermore, the thickness of the epsilon-HCP phase was found to be different at ATBs on the two sides of the twin. The difference was attributed to the internal stress due to strain incompatibility at the ATBs on the basis of residual stress analysis by the EBSD Wilkinson method and phase-field simulation of solute segregation at ATBs.

TI Effect of further alloying elements on corrosion resistance of Ni-Cr
   alloys in molten glass
SO CORROSION SCIENCE
AB The corrosion behaviour of commercial Ni-Cr alloys added with Fe, Ti, Nb and Al was evaluated in molten glass at 1050 degrees C. The static-immersion results reveal that the corrosion depth after testing for 100 h roughly remains at the same level for the alloys added with 5 wt.% Al or added with Fe, Ti and Nb (FeTiNb) separately, but decreases greatly by co-adding 5 wt.% Al with FeTiNb. However, a further increase of Al content to 15 wt.% in the co-added alloy degrades the corrosion resistance. The corrosion mechanism was discussed based on the analysis of the corrosion layer.

TI Formation of microstructures responsible for remarkable properties of
   the Ni- and Co-based superalloys
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB This article, by the example of 3 superalloys, discusses the principles that should be followed in designing new multicomponent alloys. Experimentally, it was shown that these principles are as follows: 1. Chemical interaction between dissimilar atoms exist always, in all alloys and at any temperature of heating; 2. Alloys have a not previously known property of changing the sign of the chemical interaction at a change of the temperature, subsequently leading to a change in the type of microstructures; 3. A model of pairwise interaction is realized in multicomponent alloys, according to which the chemical interaction between dissimilar atoms (which exists within each of the diffusion couples of a multi component alloy), occurs similarly to the chemical interaction in a corresponding binary alloy. Using this approach, it has been found experimentally that the process of partitioning of a multicomponent alloy into diffusion couples takes place in the liquid solution. It has been found that the remarkable properties of alloys of the Hastelloy and Tribaloy types are manifested by the fact that the tendency to phase separation takes place in the majority of their diffusion couples. It is shown that the formation of multicomponent chemical compounds (Laves phases) under conditions where in alloys there is a tendency to phase separation is impossible.

AB The Ni-based superalloy, Inconel 738LC, was corroded between 800 and 1000 degrees C for up to 100 h in the Ar/0.2%SO2 gas. The formed scales were susceptible to breakage and spallation, due partly to the incorporation of sulfur. They consisted primarily of Cr2O3, along with some TiO2 and NiO. Preferential oxidation of Cr to Cr2O3 led to the Cr depletion in the Al2O3-rich internal oxidation zone, where Ni, Co, W, and Ta tended to accumulate as corrosion progressed.

TI Modeling gas turbine materials' hot corrosion degradation in combustion
   environments from H-2-rich syngas
SO MATERIALS AND CORROSION-WERKSTOFFE UND KORROSION
AB Components of gas turbines (such as blades, vanes, combustor cans) exposed to combustion environments at high temperature are susceptible to hot corrosion attack. To successfully plan maintenance and to determine whether to operate in novel combustion modes (e.g., in integrated gasification combined cycles that incorporate pre-combustion carbon capture) predictions of hot corrosion component life must be made. In this paper, hot corrosion datasets relating to two alloys, MarM 509 (a cobalt-based superalloy), and Rene 80 (a nickel-based superalloy) form the basis of hot corrosion predictive lifetime models. The model framework is based on the two stages of incubation and propagation, with the transitions from incubation to propagation around the samples being based on Weibull statistics. The impact of a range of temperatures (including 700 and 900 degrees C), gas compositions (simulating the combustion of natural gas, H-2-rich syngas, or partially cleaned syngas), and deposit chemistries/fluxes have been assessed. Predictions have been made including the expected damage spread for a range of different exposure conditions.

TI Influence of transition group elements on the stability of the delta-
   and eta-phase in nickelbase alloys
SO MODELLING AND SIMULATION IN MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
AB To improve the high-temperature capability of 718-type wrought nickel-base superalloys, the gamma'-phase (Ni3Al) can be stabilized. However, this also reduces the size of the forging window because forging has to be done above the grand below the solvus temperature of the phase that is used to enable fine-grain forging, i.e. the delta-phase of Ni3Nb type or the eta-phase of Ni3Ti-type. Understanding the influence of alloying elements on the formation of these phases is therefore important. In this paper, density functional theory calculations at 0 K are performed to determine the stabilizing effect of aluminium and of the transition group elements on the stability of the delta-phase and eta-phase. Most of the transition group elements of 5th and 6th period stabilize the delta-phase, whereas the stabilizing effect on the eta-phase is weaker. According to the calculations, Mo, Tc, W, Re, and Os may be expected to stabilize the delta-phase but not the. eta-phase, whereas Al and Zn strongly stabilize the eta-phase. V, Zr, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, Cd, Hf, Ta, Ir, Pt, Au, and Hg stabilize both phases. For some elements (Cr, Mn, Fe, Co), magnetic effects in the d and especially in the.-phase are shown to be significant at the concentrations studied here.

TI EFFECTS OF Re AND Ru ON MICROSTRUCTURE AND SEGREGATION OF Ni-BASED
   SINGLE-CRYSTAL SUPERALLOYS
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB The influence of Re and Ru on segregation and microstructure evolution during heat treatment has been investigated in four Ni-based single-crystal superalloys with varied contents of Re (3%-6%, mass fractions) and Ru (0% and 3%). The additions of Re and Ru lead to the more severe segregation of alloying elements in as-cast structures. However, the effects of Ru on as-cast segregation can be neglected after the stepwise solution heat treatments. The additions of Re and Ru lead to the lower gamma'-coarsening rate, more cuboidal gamma'-morphology and reduced gamma'-size. Electron microprobe analysis (EPMA) indicates that Al, Ta and Ni partition to the gamma'-precipitates, whereas Re and Cr strongly partition to the gamma-matrix. In comparison to Re and Cr, Ru and W show the less tendency to partition to the gamma-matrix. Additionally, Re increases the supersaturation of Re, Cr, Co and W in the gamma-matrix, whereas Ru only slightly suppresses the partition of these TCP-forming elements to the gamma-matrix.

TI Kinetics and mechanism of reaction between water vapor, carbon monoxide
   and a chromia-forming nickel base alloy
SO CORROSION SCIENCE
AB The kinetic aspects of the competitive reaction of CO and H2O in the formation of chromia layer on a nickel base alloy at high temperature were studied by thermogravimetry combined to gas phase chromatography. It was shown that competitive adsorption occurred between both molecules and that whatever P-CO/P-H2O ratio, CO mainly reacted in the first instants of oxidation and H2O became the main long-term oxidant species. After an interfacial and diffusion mixed kinetic regime, the long-term oxidation rate was parabolic and did not depend on the water vapor content in the gas phase. The oxidation kinetics was well described by considering that the rate limiting step was the outwards diffusion of interstitial chromium cations in the oxide layer. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Our current understanding of the properties of V-Si-B alloys produced by a powder and an ingot metallurgy route is reported. This novel group of materials with high melting points above 1900 degrees C and a low density of 5.21-5.85 g/cm(3) has been identified as a potential alloy system for applications at temperatures up to 1000 degrees C. A powder metallurgical V-9Si-13B alloy with a three-phase microstructure is introduced and characterized in terms of creep behavior in the as-received and annealed state. Annealing at 1300 degrees C leads to grain growth and improved creep resistance. For comparison, the same alloy composition is produced via arc-melting, yielding a coarser microstructure. Another powder metallurgically processed alloy having the nominal composition of the phase V5SiB2 is comparably assessed. Compression creep tests at temperatures between 900 degrees C and 1050 degrees C demonstrate that these novel alloys are competitive compared to Al-Ti materials and Ni-Co superalloys.

AB The alloying system Co-Al-W-Ta is comprehensively investigated in the vicinity of the compositional point Co-9Al-10W-2Ta, at. pct. These investigations provided a large amount of quantitative information, which can be used for alloy development, namely, the compositional dependences of the gamma'-solvus, solidus, and liquidus temperatures; fraction of the extrinsic phases after casting; the compositional dependence of the gamma/gamma'-lattice misfit; the element partitioning between gamma- and gamma'-phases; and the two phase compositional area gamma/gamma' in the Co-rich part of the Co-Al-W-Ta phase diagram at 900 degrees C. It is shown that additions of Ta elevate the gamma'-solvus temperature and increase the gamma/gamma'-lattice misfit, but adding more than about 3 at. pct Ta results in a large amount of undissolvable extrinsic phases. Additionally, two Co-Al-W-Ta alloys with lower content of W were developed and solidified as [001] single crystals for mechanical testing in a temperature range between 20 and 1200 degrees C. These tests included measurement of the Young modulus, tensile tests with constant strain rate, and stress rupture tests. It was found that at temperatures up to about 750 degrees C the ultimate tensile strength of Co-Al-Ta-W alloys can be at the same level or even higher than of Ni-based superalloys.

AB The tensile creep behavior of a Co-Al-W-base single crystal alloy containing Ta and Ti was investigated at 982 degrees C and 248 MPa. The lattice misfit of experimental alloy was measured to be positive by synchrotron X-ray diffraction at high temperature, and long term heat treatment at 1000 degrees C for 1000 h revealed a gamma' volume fraction of 75% without secondary phases. The creep test indicated that the creep properties of experimental alloy exceeded commercial 1st generation Ni-base single crystal superalloy CMSX-3 with respect to the rupture life. The initial cuboidal gamma' precipitates directionally coarsened parallel to the applied stress axis during the creep process. The stacking faults in {111} planes within gamma' rafts were the primary creep deformation mode by TEM investigation.

TI Determination of Cu, Zn, As, Cd, In, Sn, Pb, and Bi in nickel-based
   superalloys after multi-matrix separation
SO ATOMIC SPECTROSCOPY
AB A procedure has been developed for the determination of critical elements such as Cu, Zn, As, Cd, In, Sn, Pb, and Bi present at trace/ultra-trace levels in different types of Ni-based superalloys. These elements were quantitatively separated from a multicomponent superalloy (nearly 10 major constituents) by a solvent extraction method using 1M KI + 2M H2SO4 medium, then extracted into MIBK (Methyl Isobutyl Ketone), and determined by Inductively Coupled Plasma Quadrupole Mass Spectrometry (ICP-QMS). Significant separation of all the major matrix elements (Al, Ti, V, Cr, Co, Nb, Mo, Hf, Ta, W, Ni, and Re) has been achieved.
   Recoveries of > 95% were achieved for the elements Cu, Zn, Cd, In, Sn, Pb, and Bi, and 85% for As. Good agreement was observed for these results with the certified values of British Chemical Standard (BCS 346) and with the values obtained from the direct analysis by Glow Discharge Quadrupole Mass Spectrometry (GD-QMS).
   Reproducibility of the procedure is 20% RSD and the accuracy is within +/- 25% for the elements at trace levels. The procedure provides detection limits of 0.7 mu g kg(-1) (Bi) and 0.07 mg kg(-1) (Zn).

AB Widely investigated AlCoCrCuFeNi high entropy alloy has been chosen for optimization of the microstructural and mechanical properties. Different paths have been chosen for optimization; namely the decrease of segregating element Cu, the increase of oxidation protective elements Al and Cr and the approach towards gamma-gamma' microstructure as in Ni-based superalloys. Microscopical observation has been made for each optimization step and compared with results obtained by Vickers microhardness measurements. Out of five derivate alloys: AlCoCrFeNi, Al23Co15Cr23Cu8Fe15Ni16, Al8Co17Cr17Cu8Fe17Ni33, Al8Co17Cr14Cu8Fe17Ni33Mo1Ti1W1 and Al10Co25Cr8Fe15Ni36Ti6, the most promising one has been chosen for further investigation.

SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB Microstructural stability and tensile properties of a Ti-containing single-crystal Co-Ni-Al-W-alloy with low tungsten content have been investigated. The alloy possesses relatively lower density and higher gamma' solvus temperature compared to some high-tungsten-content Co-Al-W-base alloys. After aging at 900-1000 degrees C for 400 h, the alloy maintains the stable gamma/gamma' two-phase microstructure without the presence of secondary phases. In the low and medium temperature range (R.T.-800 degrees C), the alloy exhibits superior tensile strength compared to the reported single-crystal Co-Al-W-base alloys, while above 800 degrees C, the yield stress decreases rapidly with temperature increasing. The major deformation mechanisms of the alloy consist of shearing of the gamma' precipitates by pairs of a/2 < 110 >-type dislocations from room temperature to 800 degrees C and bypassing of the gamma' precipitates by a/2 < 110 >-type matrix dislocations above 900 degrees C. At 900 degrees C, it shows a transition from the gamma' shearing to bypassing. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Simulation of Microstructural Evolution Based on the Phase-Field Method
   and Its Applications to Material Development
SO JOURNAL OF THE JAPAN INSTITUTE OF METALS
AB The phase-field method has recently been extended and utilized across many fields in materials science. Since this method can systematically incorporate the effect of coherent strain induced by lattice mismatch and applied stress as well as external electric and magnetic fields, it has been applied to many material processes including solidification, solid-state phase transformations and various types of complex microstructure changes.
   In this paper, firstly the calculation method of phase-field approach is briefly explained. In particular, the basic philosophy of phase-field simulation is mentioned. Secondly, we summarize the recent calculation results of the phase-field simulation of phase transformations in Fe-based alloys and Ni (or Co)-based superalloys. Finally, the image-based calculation of materials properties is explained, where the simulated microstructure image that is the output data of phase-field simulation is employed as a boundary condition for calculating the materials property, and we show the cases of the mechanical property (stress-strain curve), magnetic property (ferromagnetic hysteresis) and electric property (ferroelectric hysteresis) as typical examples of this approach.

AB Single-crystal elastic constants of Co(3)(Al,W) with the cubic L1(2) structure have been experimentally measured by resonance ultrasound spectroscopy at liquid helium temperature. The values of all the three independent single-crystal elastic constants and polycrystalline elastic constants of Co(3)(Al,W) experimentally determined are 15 similar to 25% larger than those of Ni(3)(Al,Ta) but are considerably smaller than those previously reported. Two-phase microstructures with cuboidal L1(2) precipitates being well aligned parallel to < 100 > and well faceted parallel to {100} are expected to form very easily in Co-base superalloys because of the large value of E(111)/E(100) and c(ij) of Co(3)(Al,W). This is indeed confirmed by experiment. Values of yield stress obtained for both [001] and [123] orientations of L1(2)/fcc two-phase single crystals moderately decrease with the increase in temperature up to 800 degrees C and then decrease rapidly with temperature above 800 degrees C without any anomaly in yield stress. Slip on {111} is observed to occur for both orientations in the whole temperature range investigated.

AB The isothermal oxidation behavior at 900 and 1100 degrees C in pure oxygen of several commercial single-crystal Ni-base superalloys (CMSX2, CMSX4, CMSX6, AM3, MC2, SRR99) and modified versions of some of them has been investigated. Oxide scales formed at 900 degrees C are adherent and reveal the dendritic microstructure of the subjacent alloy. These scales are composed of three layers 1- (Ti,Co,Ni)-rich oxides, 2- Cr-rich oxides and 3- (Ta,W,Ti)-rich oxides. Al-internal oxidation zone and y' depleted zone are identified. Oxide scales formed at 1100 degrees C are not adherent and spall off extensively regardless of cooling rate. The critical temperature drop to initiate spallation (Delta T) depends on the oxide layer thickness (xi) and the interfacial rupture energy (y(F)). For a given oxide/metal couple (Delta T)(2) xi/y(F), is constant (EVANS and LOBB model). AM3 and CMSX4 alloys follow this model while AM3 and MC2 modified alloys have different behavior. Addition of Si and Hf and substitution of Mo by Re or Pt and Ti by Ta improve oxidation resistance at 900 degrees C and scale adherence at 1100 degrees C.

SO ATOMIC SPECTROSCOPY
AB A simple and rapid method is proposed for the determination of critical thallium present at trace and ultra-trace levels in different types of Ni-based superalloys by inductively coupled plasma quadrupole mass spectrometry (ICP-QMS).
   Thallium was quantitatively separated from a multi-component superalloy (containing nearly 10 major constituents) by a solvent extraction method using 1M HBr, then extracted into diethyl ether, and measured by ICP-QMS. Significant separation of all major matrix elements (Al, Ti, V, Cr, Co, Nb, Mo, Hf, Ta, W, Ni, and Re) was achieved.
   Recovery of thallium was found to be 99%. Reasonable agreement was observed for these results with the certified values of British Chemical Standards (BCS-346 and BCS-345) and with the values obtained from the direct and matrix-separation analysis by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (GFAAS).
   Using ICP-QMS, the reproducibility of the method was 10% RSD at trace levels and 20% RSD at low parts per billion levels. The accuracy was within +/- 15% at trace levels, and the detection limits achieved were 2 ng g(-1) for thallium.

The results showed that proper addition of solution strengthening elements, such as Co, Cr, W, Mo, improved tensile strength, while excessive addition of those elements facilitated the precipitation of mu phase, which seriously aggravated the plasticity of the P/M superalloy. For the heat-treated specimens, the relationship between critical aging time (when mu started to precipitate) aging temperature, and the average electron vacancy number of gamma matrix was established.

TI DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW NI-BASE SUPERALLOY FOR INDUSTRIAL GAS-TURBINE
   COMBUSTOR BY STATISTICAL ALLOY DESIGN METHOD
SO TETSU TO HAGANE-JOURNAL OF THE IRON AND STEEL INSTITUTE OF JAPAN
AB A new Ni-base superalloy has been developed for gas turbine combustor.  In the first stage, multiple regression analysis was conducted on the published material data of superalloys.  The eatimation equations were established to estimate the mechanical properties such as stress rupture strength and tensile properties, and physical properties such as density and thermal conductivity.  Alloy design program by statistical method was made to select the alloy chemical compositions which will satisfy the requirements of structural design.  By means of this alloy design method, 22%Cr-8%Co-9%Mo-3%W-1%Al-0.3%Ti-Ni base alloy (%:mass%) was set up for combustor superalloy.  The superalloy plates using these alloy elements were manufactured by vacuum induction and remelting process weighing 2000 kg.
   The mechanical and physical properties were examined on those plates, and it is confirmed that these estimated values by alloy design coincide with the testing measured values.  As above test results, it is considered that the statistical alloy design is useful for developing new superalloys.  The new Ni-base superalloy also has good workability, good mechanical and physical properties for industrial gas turbine combustor.

AB Nb is one of the common refractory elements added in Ni, Co and Fe based superalloys. This lead to the formation of brittle topological close packed (tcp) mu phase, which is deleterious to the structure. It mainly grows by interdiffusion and in the present article, the interdiffusion process in different Nb-X (X=Ni, Co, Fe) systems is discussed. The activation energy for interdiffusion is lower in the Co-Nb system (173 kJ/mol) than Fe-Nb system (233 kJ/mol), which is again lower than the value found in the Ni-Nb system (319.7 kJ/mol). The mole fraction of Nb in this phase is less than Fe or Co at stoichiometric compositions in the Nb-Fe (that is Fe7Nb6) and Nb-Co (that is Co7Nb6) systems. On the other hand, the mole fraction of Nb is higher than Ni in the same phase (Ni6Nb2) in Ni-Nb system. However, in all the phases, Nb has lower diffusion rate. Possible diffusion mechanism in this phase is discussed with respect to the crystal structure.

AB The vapour pressure of halide species generated at high temperatures in pack powder mixtures containing Al, Si, halide salt and Al2O3 were analysed by means of thermochemical calculations in an attempt to identify suitable halide activators and pack ;compositions for codepositing Al and Si to form diffusion coatings on nickel-base superalloys by the pack cementation process. The halide salts investigated were AlF3, AlCl3, NH4Cl and CrCl(3)(.)6H(2)O. The results of thermochemical calculations suggested that compositions of pack powder mixtures activated by NH4Cl and CrCl(3)(.)6H(2)O may be adjusted to create deposition conditions favourable for codepositing Al and Si, but the pack powder mixtures activated by AlF3 or AlCl3 may only deposit Al. Guided by the thermochemical calculations, a series of pack powder mixtures activated by CrCl(3)(.)6H(2)O were formulated and coating deposition experiments were carried out at 1000 and 1100 degreesC. With adequate control of pack compositions and deposition conditions, it was found that codeposition of Al and Si could indeed be achieved at these temperatures. A mixture of elemental Al and Si powders may be used as a depositing source instead of using Al-Si master alloy powders as conventionally recommended. Depending on the deposition temperature used, the coatings could be formed either through the inward diffusion of Al and Si or through the outward diffusion of Ni together with other substrate elements such as Cr and Co with the respective coating structures associated with the two coating formation mechanisms. The pack compositions and deposition conditions may be adjusted to control the microstructure of the coatings formed by the codeposition process. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Effect of W Content on Oxidation Resistance of Experimental Third
   Generation Single Crystal Superalloys
SO RARE METAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING
AB The isothermal oxidation behaviors of three kinds of experimental third generation single crystal superalloys with different tungsten contents were investigated at 1100 degrees C in air by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning election microscopy (SEM) and energy disperse X-ray analysis (EDS). The results show that three kinds of alloys approximately obey subparabolic rate law during oxidation at 1100 degrees C for 100 h. The mass gain of 8 wt% W-containing alloy is higher than that of 6 wt% and 7 wt% W-containing alloys. The oxide scale exposed at 1100 degrees C consists of three layers: an outer Ni(Co)O layer, an intermediate layer mainly composed of oxides and spinels, and an inner Al2O3 layer. The gamma'-free layer is formed in the base alloy. In the current alloy system, the transition of oxidation mechanism happens with increasing W content at 1100 degrees C; therefore, it is found that the alloys with W content less than 7% exhibit relative balance between oxidation resistance and solution strength.

TI Comparison of thermal expansion and oxidation behavior of various
   high-temperature coating materials and superalloys
SO MATERIALS AT HIGH TEMPERATURES
AB The thermal expansion mismatch between a metallic substrate and its external oxide scale generates a strain on cooling that is a primary cause of spallation of protective oxide scales. This study compares thermal expansion behavior and cyclic oxidation performance of the two major composition classes of high-temperature commercial coatings for protection of single-crystal superalloys. The thermal expansion of cast MCrAlY (M = Ni and/or Co) alloys and cast aluminides (NiAl, (Ni,Pt)Al and Ni(3)Al) was measured at temperatures up to 1300degreesC and compared to that of a single-crystal Ni-base superalloy. The tendency for scale spallation from each alloy was evaluated by cyclic oxidation testing at 1150degreesC. The coefficients of thermal expansion for the aluminides were lower than those of the MCrAlY-based alloys at all temperatures and scale adherence to the Hf-doped aluminides was generally superior. Scale adherence to the various compositions of MCrAlY-type alloys did not directly correlate to their thermal expansion behavior or substrate strength. For both types of materials, the presence of a reactive element (Y,Hf, etc.) had no detectable effect on thermal expansion but a major effect on scale adherence. There was no obvious influence of At content on the thermal expansion of beta phase Ni-Al compositions. The addition of Pt resulted in a lower average thermal expansion for hyperstoichiometric (Ni,Pt)AI at temperatures above 930degreesC, but this effect was not observed in hypostoichiometric (Ni,Pt)AI.

SO MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS
AB The additive manufacturing (AM) process, which can produce highly complex components, has been getting significant attention in both industry and academic research. Ti-based alloys, Ni-based superalloys, and Co-Cr-based alloys have been widely investigated. However, as Ni-based superalloys have precipitated phases such as the gamma' and gamma '' phases, and Ti-based alloys and Co-Cr-based alloys are multiphase alloys which have phase transformation, it is difficult to clarify the factors in the AM process that in fluence the strength of these alloys. In this study, SUS316L stainless steel, which is a single-phase solid-solution alloy and does not have precipitated phases, was used to investigate the effect of specific factors in the AM process on anisotropy or mechanical properties, and the strengthening mechanism in the AM process in comparison with SUS316L plastic-forming (PF) material. The AM SUS316L was fabricated by selective laser melting using an ytterbium fiber laser from fine metallic powder. We found that the coarse columnar grains grew up along the built direction and the dislocation cell structures which were induced during the AM process into the AM material. During the solution heat treatment, dislocation recovery was observed. The AM specimens showed higher tensile and creep strength compared with the conventional material (the PF material) because of the high dislocation density. The ductility of the AM specimens was lower than that of the conventional material because of defects caused by a lack of fusion at the molten pool boundaries. Furthermore, the specimens whose loading direction corresponds to the built direction showed lower strength and elongation than the specimens whose loading direction was perpendicular to the built direction due to the oriented defects.

TI Influence of welding on low cycle fatigue properties of Co-based
   superalloy FSX-414
SO TRANSACTIONS OF NONFERROUS METALS SOCIETY OF CHINA
AB Co-based superalloys such as FSX-414 have been recently used in gas turbine first stage nozzles. During service, nozzles are exposed to low cycle fatigue, which can lead to cracking of these components. The cracks on these nozzles are usually welded with tungsten arc welding (TIG) using Co-based filler metals. In this paper, the effect of TIG on the tensile and low cycle fatigue properties of Co-based superalloy FSX-414 was studied at 950 degrees C. The experimental results show that the yield and ultimate tensile stresses of welded and unwelded specimens are comparable to each other. But toughness of welded specimens is lower than that of unwelded ones. The low cycle fatigue properties of FSX-414 were studied at a strain rate of 3.3x10(-4) s(-1), strain ratio R=-1 (R=epsilon(min)/epsilon(max)) and Delta epsilon(t) (total strain change) from 0.8% to 2%. In welded specimens, at high strain cycling, the nucleation and growth of cracks occur in the welded zone. But at Delta epsilon(t)=0.8%, fracture occurs in the same zones of unwelded specimens. The results show that the total fatigue lives of the welded specimens are shorter than those of unwelded ones. In all of the low cycle fatigue tests, softening phenomena are observed.

AB The influence of microstructure stability on the creep properties of single crystal nickel-based superalloys was investigated by means of the measurement of the creep curves and microstructure observation. Results show that the superalloy with 4%(mass fraction)W in Ni-Al-Cr-Ta-Co-5.5%Mo-x%W systems displays a better microstructure stability, but the P phase is precipitated in the superalloy with 6% W during aging. The strip-like mu phase is precipitated to be parallel or perpendicular to each other along the < 110 > orientation, and grown into the slice-like morphology along the {111} planes. The superalloy with 4%W displays a better creep rupture lifetime under the applied stress of 200 MPa at 982 degrees C, but the creep lifetime of alloy is obviously decreased with the increase of the element W content up to 6%. The fact that the mu phase is precipitated in the superalloy with 6% W during applied stress and unstress aging results in the appearance of the poor regions for the refractory elements. This is one of the main reasons for reducing the creep rupture lifetime of the superalloy.

   alloys
SO INTERMETALLICS
AB Diffusion behaviors of Rh, Ta, W, Re, Os, and Ir in ternary gamma'-Ni3Al alloys were investigated at 1373-1473 K using solid-solid single-phase diffusion couples together with the recently developed HitDIC software. The temperature-and concentration-dependent ternary interdiffusivities in Ni3Al-X (X - Rh, Ta, W, Re, Os, and 1r) were determined from the experimental concentration profiles, and also fully validated. After that, a thorough comparison among the interdiffusivities in gamma' Ni-22.9 at% Al-0.1 at% X (X = Ti, V, Cr, Fe, Co, Ni, Nb, Mo, Ru, Rh, Ta, W, Re, Os, Ir and Pt) alloys at 1373-1473 K was then conducted, from which it can be concluded that W exhibits the lowest interdiffusivities in gamma'-Ni3Al alloy, followed by Ta. It is finally suggested that addition of W and Ta in gamma' phase can retard the coarsening of gamma' phase and stabilize the microstructure of the nickel-based single crystal superalloys in terms of the diffusion coefficient.

TI Neutron and synchrotron probes in the development of Co-Re-based alloys
   for next generation gas turbines with an emphasis on the influence of
   boron additives
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED CRYSTALLOGRAPHY
AB Nickel-based superalloys are the materials of choice in the hot section of current gas turbines, but they are reaching temperature limits constrained by their melting temperature range. Co-Re alloy development was prompted by a search for new materials for future gas turbines, where the temperature of application will be considerably higher. Addition of the very high melting point refractory metal Re to Co can increase the melting range of Co alloys to much higher temperatures than the commercial Co alloys in use today. The alloy development strategy is first discussed very briefly. In this program, model ternary and quaternary compositions were studied in order to develop a basic understanding of the alloy system. In situ neutron and synchrotron measurements (small and wide angle) at high temperatures were extensively used for this purpose and some selected results from the in situ measurements are presented. In particular, the effect of boron doping in Co-Re-Cr alloys and the stability of the TaC precipitates at high temperatures were investigated. A fine dispersion of TaC precipitates strengthens some Co-Re alloys, and their stability at the application temperature is critical for the long-term creep properties.

TI Creep mechanisms of a new Ni-Co-base disc superalloy at an intermediate
   temperature
SO JOURNAL OF MICROSCOPY
AB The microstructures of a new Ni-Co-base disc superalloy, TMW-4M3, before and after the creep test at 725 degrees C/630 MPa have been systematically investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The crept microstructures were marked as three different deformation stages (I, II and III) corresponding to the gradually increased strain. At stage I, stacking fault (SF) shearing was the main deformation mechanism. The SF was extrinsic and lay on {111} plane. However, deformation microtwinning became the dominant mode at stage II and III. The average spacing of deformation twins decreased from 109 +/- 15 nm at stage II to 76 +/- 12 nm at stage III, whereas the twin thickness did not change significantly. The influence of stacking fault energy (SFE) of ? matrix on the deformation mechanism is discussed. It is suggested that lower SFE in TMW-4M3 is partly responsible for the enhanced creep resistance.

AB Co is considered to be one of the main ingredients in superalloys. Co is considered a critical element and its substitution is difficult due to its unique ability to form high temperature stable structures with high mechanical and corrosion/oxidation resistance. High entropy alloys (HEA) represent a relatively new concept in material design. HEA are characterised by a high number of alloying elements, in unusually high proportion. Due to their specific particularities, high entropy alloys tend to form predominant solid solution structures that develop potentially high chemical, physical and mechanical properties. Present paper is studying Co-less high entropy alloys with high potential in severe environment applications. The high entropy alloys based on Al-Cr-Fe-Mn-Ni system were prepared by induction melting and casting under protective atmosphere. The as-cast specimens were heat treated at various temperatures to determine the structure and property behaviour. Samples taken before and after heat treatment were investigated for chemical, physical, structural and mechanical characteristics. Sigma phase composition and heat treatment parameters had major influence over the resulted alloy structure and properties.

TI Synergistic effect of co-alloying elements on site preferences and
   elastic properties of Ni3Al: A first-principles study
SO INTERMETALLICS
AB The site preferences of co-alloying elements (Mo-Ta, Mo-Re, Mo-Cr) in Ni3Al are studied using first-principles calculations, and the effects of these alloying elements on the elastic properties of Ni3Al are evaluated by elastic property calculations. The results show that the Mo-Ta, Mo-Re and Mo-Cr atom pairs all prefer Al-Al sites and the spatial neighbor relation of substitution sites almost has no influence on the site preference results. Furthermore, the Young's modulus of Ni3Al increases much higher by substituting Al-Al sites with co-alloying atoms, among which Mo-Re has the best strengthening effect. The enhanced chemical bondings between alloying atoms and their neighbor host atoms are considered to be the main strengthening mechanism of the alloying elements in Ni3Al. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB We report on the microstructural evolution of the heat affected zone of a gamma/gamma'-strengthened Co-Ti-W alloy upon laser cladding with a CoNiCrAlY coating. Using electron microscopy and atom probe tomography we observed two distinct heat affect zones, namely gamma islands containing gamma' precipitate (similar to 45 nm in size) colonies and heat affected gamma/gamma' regions outside the gamma islands comprising fine gamma' precipitates (similar to 25 nm in size). Based on the experimental data and thermodynamic calculations, we propose a model for the formation of these two heat affected zones and discuss the differences in the observed precipitate sizes.

TI Microstructural Characterisations and High Temperature Oxidation Studies
   of Nanostructured Co-Al Coatings Deposited on Superalloy
SO TRANSACTIONS OF THE INDIAN INSTITUTE OF METALS
AB The microstructural characterizations and high temperature oxidation of magnetron sputtered Co-Al coatings on the superalloy substrate have been studied in the present work. FE-SEM/EDS and XRD were used to characterize the morphology and formation of different phases in the coatings, respectively. Thermo gravimetric technique was used to investigate the oxidation of the coatings, in air at 900A degrees C. The growth kinetics of the oxide layers was predicted using weight change of the coated sample measured during oxidation. It was found that the oxidation rate of Co-Al coated superalloy was lower than that uncoated superalloy due to the formation of continuous dense, adherent and protective oxide scale such as CoO, Al2O3, Cr2O3, CoCr2O4, and CoAl2O4 over the surface of the coatings exposed to air at high temperature oxidation, 900A degrees C. The microstructural features and phases of the oxidised coatings were used to elucidate the mechanism of high temperature oxidation.

AB A Co-Ni-based alloy strengthened by gamma'-(L1(2)) precipitates was utilized to investigate the precipitation evolution after various cooling rates and several aging conditions. In this study, the precipitate size and volume fraction have been studied via scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The influence of the precipitation evolution was measured via microhardness tests. The cooling rate study shows a more sluggish gamma' precipitation reaction compared to that observed in a Ni-based superalloy. Following a rapid cooling rate, the application of appropriate double aging treatments allows for the increase of the gamma' volume fraction as well as the control of the size and distribution of the precipitates. The highest hardness values reach those measured on supersolvus cast and wrought Ni-based superalloys. The observed gamma' precipitation behavior should have implications for the production, the heat treatment, the welding, or the additive manufacturing of this new class of high-temperature materials.

AB In this paper, the effect of surface oxidation on corrosion behaviour of Co-20.8Ni-6Al-10Cu-11Fe alloy in molten cryolite is investigated. The samples were produced by casting and then were oxidised at 1000 degrees C for 10, 30 and 70 h respectively. The oxide layers were studied by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). To determine the corrosion behaviour of the oxidised samples, they were exposed to molten cryolite at 930 degrees C for 20 h. After corrosion, the samples were studied by SEM. The results showed that all the samples corroded, but the sample oxidised for 70 h, was more stable than the other and the other one that oxidised for 10 h, corroded severely.

TI Pre-oxidation of Inconel alloys for inhibition of carbon deposition from

SO OXIDATION OF METALS
AB Exposure of superalloy surfaces to jet fuel at elevated temperatures leads to the formation of carbonaceous deposits and metal sulfides. The formation of stable oxide layers on alloy surfaces can reduce the activity of the constituent transition metals that catalyze the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons and the subsequent carbon deposit growth. The metals Ni, Cr, Fe, Mn, Al, Ti and Nb + Ta form thermodynamically stable oxide layers after oxidation above 800 degrees C under O-2 flow. In this study, we investigated the formation of oxides and spinels on three different Ni-base superalloys (Inconel 600, Inconel 718, and Inconel X750) and their activity towards carbon and sulfur deposit formation from jet fuel (JP-8) thermal stressing at 600 degrees C and 34 atm (500 psig) for 5 hr. Metal oxide formation during pre-oxidation and the behavior of pre-oxidized samples in thermal stressing were found to depend strongly on the minor element composition of these superalloys.

SO MATERIALS & DESIGN
AB In order to understand the influence of Ru and Re on the concentration distributions of elements in gamma' and gamma phases, the partitioning behaviors of elements in various alloy are investigated by means of atom probe tomography (APT). Results showthat the elements Al, Ta and Ni are enriched in gamma' phase, while the elements Co, Cr, Mo, W, Re and Ru are enriched in. matrix phase. Adding Ru may decrease the partitioning ratio of elements in gamma and gamma' phases. Wherein, when Ru atoms dissolve into gamma' phase to substitute the Al atoms, some Re, Mo andWatoms adhered in the round of Ru atoms, under the hybridization effect of d orbit, may dissolve into.' phase, which is thought to be the main reason of Ru decreasing the partitioning ratios of gamma' and gamma phases. When adding Re into the alloy, the Re atomswith lowdiffusion coefficientmay hinder the diffusion of other atoms away from gamma' phase during the growth of.' phase, which is thought to be themain reason of decreasing the partitioning ratios of elements in gamma and gamma' phase.

TI Atomic diffusion in liquid nickel: First-principles modeling
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB Self- and impurity diffusion coefficients are assessed in the liquid nickel system by the fundamental ab initio molecular dynamics approach. The impurity diffusion coefficients in the Ni-X systems (X=C, Co, N, Nb, Ta, Ti, W) are mostly not available in the current literature. The simulations are performed at four temperatures, in the range from 1903 to 2303 K, which allows to extract activation energies and frequency factors for the temperature dependent diffusion coefficient assuming an Arrhenius-type behavior in the liquid. In addition to the temperature dependence, the concentration-dependent impurity diffusion was investigated for the Ni-Co system. The data are of relevance for the development of the state-of-the art Ni-based superalloys and alternative binder systems in cemented carbides. The obtained theoretical results are in very good agreement with the limited experimental data for the diffusion in liquid Ni systems. Published by AIP Publishing.

TI A first-principles study of the effect of Ta on the superlattice
   intrinsic stacking fault energy of L1(2)-Co-3(Al,W)
SO INTERMETALLICS
AB New Co-based alloys containing a L1(2) reinforcement phase display exceptional high-temperature properties. Early research has shown that the quaternary alloy Co-8.8Al-9.8W-2Ta (at.%) has a high-temperature strength comparable to single-crystal Ni-based superalloys above 1200 K. Associated With high strength is an unusual high density of intrinsic stacking faults within the gamma' precipitates. In this work, Density Functional Theory, the Axial Next Nearest Neighbor Ising model and Special Quasi-random Structures have been used to calculate the stacking fault energy of L1(2)-Co-3(ALW) and the effect of small Ta additions on the stacking fault energy. The model predicts a superlattice intrinsic stacking fault energy of 90-93 mJ/m(2), which increases up to 30% when one Ta atom is substituted on the AIM/ sub-lattice. This effect can be explained by considering d-band effects resulting from the addition of Ta. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Lattice strain evolution in a high volume fraction polycrystal nickel
   superalloy
SO SCRIPTA MATERIALIA
AB Lattice strain evolution is measured by neutron diffractrometry during tensile testing of a high volume fraction polycrystal nickel superalloy. The intergranular strains reveal anisotropic deformation, with the {200} plane being least stiff and the {111} being the stiffest. Initial plasticity is due to yielding of the {220}. Deconvolution of the {200} and {220} doublets reveals co-deformation of gamma and gamma' phases during plasticity. Comparisons are drawn with low and medium volume fraction superalloys.

TI An investigation of diffusion-mediated cyclic coarsening and reversal
   coarsening in an advanced Ni-based superalloy
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB The anomalous cyclic coarsening behaviour of gamma' precipitates after ageing at 1073 K has been investigated for the low misfit commercial powder metallurgy (PM) Ni-based superalloy RR1000. Using scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) imaging combined with absorption-corrected energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy, the elemental segregation as a function of coarsening behaviour has been experimentally observed for secondary gamma' precipitates. Elemental EDX spectrum imaging has revealed nanoscale enrichment of Co and Cr and a depletion of Al and Ti within the gamma matrix close to the gamma-gamma' interface. Our experimental results, coupled with complementary modelling and synchrotron X-ray diffraction analysis, demonstrate the importance of elastic strain energy resulting from local compositional variations for influencing precipitate morphology. In particular, elemental inhomogeneities, as a result of complex diffusive interactions within both matrix and precipitates, play a crucial role in determining the rate of coarsening. Our findings provide important new evidence for understanding the microstructural evolution observed for advanced superalloys when they are exposed to different heat treatment regimes.

TI Atomistic simulations of solid solution strengthening in Ni-based
   superalloy
SO COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB The interaction between an edge dislocation and the solid solution elements (Co, Ru and Re) of different concentration in Ni is investigated by means of molecular dynamics simulation. It is figured out that Ru atoms hinder dislocation movement more effectively than Co atoms under the same concentration. The solid solution strengthening of Re atoms being introduced to Ni crystal is obviously stronger than that of Co and Ru atoms addition. With first-principles density functional theory approach, it is found that one of the leading factors of solid solution strengthening can be attributed to the interaction between host atoms and solid solution elements located in the slip plane, which leads to the stacking-fault energy increasing.

TI HOT CORROSION-RESISTANCE OF COATED SINGLE-CRYSTAL SUPERALLOYS UNDER
   MARINE CONDITIONS
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Uncoated and coated nickel base superalloys designed for use in gas turbine blades and vanes were tested at 900-degrees-C in a high velocity burner rig. Diesel fuel, with an injection of 5 ppm sea salt, was used to simulate marine engine conditions. The uncoated alloys, namely, single crystal SRR99, CMSX-2, SX60A, and MMT143 and polycrystalline MAR-M002, IN 738 LC, and IN-100, were all severely attacked by oxidation and corrosion after only 100 h of the cyclic test. A high chromium level in the alloy improved the hot corrosion resistance, whereas high molybdenum and tungsten contents were detrimental. The degradation in the 900-degrees-C tests was much greater than that experienced in previous tests at 1100-degrees-C using aviation kerosene fuel. Simple diffusion aluminide, platinum aluminide RT22, and four overlay coatings (air plasma sprayed LCO22, LCO22 plus aluminising, sputter ion plated Ni-Cr-Al-Si, and electron beam physical vapour deposited Ni-Co-Cr-Al-Y) all protected the alloys. The Ni-Co-Cr-Al-Y coating failed after 400 h but the other coatings were still protective after 1000 h. A rank order for the coatings has been obtained via metallographic studies.

TI Surface chemistry evolution of F-doped Ni-base superalloy upon heat
   treatment
SO MATERIALS AND CORROSION-WERKSTOFFE UND KORROSION
AB Ni-based superalloys with Al-contents between 3 and 5wt% exhibit insufficient oxidation resistance at temperatures above 900 degrees C. A change of the oxidation mechanism has been achieved after doping surface-near regions with fluorine by ion implantation and subsequent heat treatment. With that, the formation of a protective alumina scale was observed. This study is dedicated to the nature of the kinetic bias for the alumina scale formation. The samples of alloy IN738 (3.5wt% Al) were implanted with F-ions (10(17)F/cm(2) at 38keV). The depth profiles of O, Ni, Cr, Co, Ti, and Al were determined using secondary neutrals mass spectrometry (SNMS), whereas the F-depth profiles were measured by non-destructive proton-induced gamma-ray emission (PIGE). Directly after F-implantation no Al-enrichment near the surface was observed. After heating up to temperatures between 400 and 800 degrees C, no distinct alumina scale formation was observed. At 1000 and 1050 degrees C, a distinct Al-rich region has formed. Extending the oxidation time up to 12h leads to a pronounced Al-profile, suggesting the growth of a pure alumina scale near the surface.

TI MCrAlY coating design based on oxidation-diffusion modelling. Part I:
   Microstructural evolution
SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB To improve the efficiency of modern gas turbines, it is highly desired to develop durable MCrAlY alloys, to be used as protective coatings against oxidation and corrosion for superalloys which are the base materials for some hot components like turbine blades and vanes. In this paper, an oxidation-diffusion model was used to simulate the diffusion of alloying elements and the corresponding microstructural changes in different superalloy-coating systems at high temperature. Two important processes are considered in this model: oxidation of the coating and interdiffusion between the superalloy and the coating. The model showed an accurate predictability of the diffusion and microstructural evolution in real superalloy-coating diffusion couples studied at high-temperature exposure. The model was further applied to investigate the elemental effects of Ni, Co, Cr and Al on the microstructural evolution, considering the development of two important phases in superalloys and coatings, i.e. FCC-gamma' and BCC-beta, at different temperatures. The results in this paper deepen the knowledge of the MCrAlY coating design for superalloy-coating systems in high-temperature applications. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SO METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND
   MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB We proposed a new method for developing Ni-base turbine disc alloy for application at temperatures above 700 degrees C by mixing a Ni-base superalloy U720LI with a two-phase alloy Co-16.9 wt pet Ti in various contents. The microstructure and phase stability of the alloys were analyzed using an optical microscope, a scanning electron microscope, energy-dispersive spectroscopy, and an X-ray diffractometer. The yield strength was studied by compression tests at temperatures ranging from 25 degrees C to 1200 degrees C. The results show that all the alloys had a dendritic structure. Ni3Ti (eta) phase was formed in the interdendritic region in the alloys with the addition of Co-16.9 wt pet Ti, and its volume fraction increased with the increase in the addition of Co-16.9 wt pet Ti. The results of exposure at 750 degrees C show that the addition of Co-16.9 wt pet Ti to U720LI had a great effect on suppressing the formation of a phase due to the reduced Cr content in the gamma matrix. Compared to U720LI, the alloys with the addition of Co-16.9 wt pet Ti possessed higher yield strength. The solid-solution strengthening of gamma and gamma' and higher volume fraction of gamma' were assumed to cause this strength increase.

TI Dendrite Segregation in Ni3Al-Based Intermetallic Single Crystals
   Alloyed with Cr, Mo, W, Ti, Co, and Re
SO RUSSIAN METALLURGY
AB The character of dendrite segregation in Ni3Al-based intermetallic VKNA-type alloy single crystals with a dendritic-cellular structure is studied. Distribution coefficient k(d) of an alloying element (AE) in the alloy during solidification k(d) = c(d.a.I)/c(0) (c(0) is the AE content in the alloy (liquid phase composition), c(d.a.I) is the AE content in primary dendrite arms of the alloy (in the solid phase)) and segregation coefficient k(s) = c(d.a.I)/c(i.d) (c(i.d) is the AE content in the interdendritic space) have been found. A comparative study of the dendrite segregation parameters in VKNA-nype Ni3Al-based intermetallic alloys and the well-known ZhS36type nickel superalloy shows that the intermetallic alloys satisfy to the rule deduced for two- and three-component nickel-based superalloys: if an introduced AE increases the melting temperature of the basic metal, we have k(d) > 1 (Co, W, Re); if it decreases the melting temperature, we have k(d) < 1 (Al, Ti, Cr, Mo). Dendrite segregation coefficients k(s) are dependent on the proportion of the AE contents in the alloys. In nickel superalloys, the dendrite segregation of aluminum, tungsten, and rhenium is higher than that in the intermetallic alloys. The dendrite segregation coefficients of tungsten and rhenium is higher by a factor of 1.5-2 than that in the VKNA-type intermetallic alloys with a low content of refractory metals. This can be due to the retardation of diffusion of refractory metals in the solid phase of a nickel superalloy highly alloyed with these elements.

These deleterious phases grow mainly by diffusion process in the superalloy substrate. Significant volume change was found because of growth of the p phase in Co-Mo system. Growth kinetics of this phase and different diffusion parameters, like interdiffusion, intrinsic and tracer diffusion coefficients are calculated. Further the activation energy, which provides an idea about the mechanism, is determined.

AB The present study focuses on the microstructural evolution in Co-Re-Cr-Ni alloys at high temperatures. Four alloys with different Cr and Ni contents were studied. The microstructural examinations were performed using complementary methods of scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry and neutron diffraction. Based on the experimental results and assisted by thermodynamic calculations, the effect of Cr and Ni on the microstructure could be identified. While both Ni and Cr, but Cr only if Ni is also present in the alloy, stabilize the fcc phase, the impacts of these elements on the sigma phase formation are different. It was found that the temperature stability of the sigma phase enhances with increasing Cr content, whereas Ni reduces the required Cr concentration for the sigma phase formation. The evaluation of the Cr and Ni effects on the microstructural evolution contributes to a fundamental understanding of the alloy behaviour and, thus, is a key aspect for successful alloy development.

TI The effect of Ni:Co ratio on the elemental phase partitioning in
   gamma-gamma ' Ni-Co-Al-Ti-Cr alloys
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB Atom probe tomography has been used to characterise the effect of varying Ni:Co ratio on elemental phase partitioning at 800 degrees C in gamma-gamma' alloys derived from the Ni-Co-Al-Ti-Cr system. In all alloys tested, Al and Ti were found to partition preferentially to the gamma' phase, whereas Co and Cr partitioned preferentially to the y phase. However, above a critical Co content (-19 at.%), the extent of partitioning of Al and Ti to the gamma' phase reduced. Conversely, Cr partitioned more strongly to the y phase with Co additions of up to 19 at.%, above which this preferential segregation was less pronounced. This non-monotonic trend of elemental partitioning behaviour with increasing Co concentration was attributed to a transition in the chemistry of the L1(2) gamma' phase from Ni-3(Ti, Al) to (Ni, Co)(3)(Ti, Al) and thus to a change in its solute solubility.

SO MATERIALS AND MANUFACTURING PROCESSES
AB Experiments were performed using conductive powder-mixed dielectric in electrical discharge machining of Super Co 605 and optimization is carried out by means of Taguchi method. The process input parameters selected are flushing pressure, discharge voltage, pulse on-time, polarity, peak current, and pulse off-time to study the performance characteristics in the form of surface roughness, tool wear, and material removal rate. Experiments based on appropriate orthogonal array are conducted and significant parameters are identified. The optimum process conditions simultaneously leading to a better surface roughness, lower tool wear, and higher material removal rate are then demonstrated by confirmation testing. The experimental results confirm an improvement in surface roughness, tool wear, and material removal rate when Taguchi method is used.

AB The microstructure and hot corrosion behavior of a Si-Y-Co-modified aluminide coating prepared on a nickel base superalloy DZ125 by the pack cementation process was studied. The Co-Al-Si-Y coated specimen had a mass gain of only 0.25 mg/cm(2) after being exposed to NaCl + Na2SO4 salt for 100 h at 1173 K. Thus the addition of Si to a Y-Co-modified aluminide coating increased its hot corrosion resistance by 40 %. The improved hot corrosion resistance of the Co-Al-Si-Y coating was mainly attributed to the formation of an Al2O3 scale with SiO2 on the surface of the coating during the hot corrosion test. SiO2 can prohibit the high fluxing rate of dissolution of the protective Al2O3 scale and prevent rapid corrosion attack owing to its low solubility over a wide range of salt acidity and its weak oxygen permeability.

TI TCP phase predictions in Ni-based superalloys: Structure maps revisited
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB The traditional methods for predicting the occurrence of deleterious topologically close-packed (TCP) phases in Ni-based superalloys have been based on the PHACOMP and newPHACOMP methodologies. These schemes use the average number of holes (N) over bar (h) or the centre of gravity of the elemental d-bands (M) over bard to predict whether or not a given multicomponent alloy will be prone to TCP formation. However, as both these one-dimensional methodologies are well-known to fail with respect to new generations of alloys, a novel two-dimensional structure map ((N) over bar, (Delta V/V) over bar) is introduced where N is the average electron concentration and (Delta V/V) over bar is a composition-dependent size-factor difference. This map is found to separate the experimental data on the TCP phases of binary A-B transition metal alloys into well-defined but sometimes overlapping regions corresponding to different structure types such as A15, sigma, chi, R, P, delta, mu, M and Laves. Detailed investigations of ternary phase diagrams and multicomponent systems show that TCP phases, regardless of the number of constituents, are located in the same regions of the structure map that are favoured by the binary compounds of the same structure type. The structure map is then used in conjunction with CALPHAD computations of sigma phase stability to show that the predictive power of newPHACOMP for the seven component Ni-Co-Cr-Ta-W-Re-Al system studied recently by Reed et al. [24] is indeed poor.

TI Stability of ordered L1(2) and B-2 precipitates in face centered cubic
   based high entropy alloys - Al0.3CoFeCrNi and Al0.3CuFeCrNi2
SO SCRIPTA MATERIALIA
AB Adding a small amount of Al to the well-known high entropy alloy (HEA), Al0.1CoCrFeNi, to form Al0.3CoCrFeNi, leads to the precipitation of highly refined ordered L1(2) precipitates, which are stable at 550 C. However, the L12 precipitates (stoichiometry of (Ni,Cr)(3)(Al,Fe,Co)) are de-stabilized and replaced by coarser B2 precipitates on annealing at 700 C. Contrastingly, in the Co-free, Al0.3CuCrFeNi2 high entropy alloy, the L1(2) precipitates are stable at both 550 degrees C (similar to 5 nm) and 700 degrees C (similar to 50 nm), and exhibit a stoichiometry of (NLCu)(3)(ALFe,Cr). These results lead to interesting insights into the stability of ordered phases in HEAs as a function of composition and temperature. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Corrosion Performance of Ni-Based Alloys in Sodium Metavanadate
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTROCHEMICAL SCIENCE
AB Hot corrosion or molten salt corrosion is a form of corrosion which consumes materials to high corrosion rates, because it destroys the protective oxide layer formed on the metal surface. Therefore, it has been developed more resistant materials such as superalloys which have been manufactured for high temperature applications. A study of the corrosion performance of Ni-based alloys (Inconel 600, 601, 617 and 625) in NaVO3 molten salt at 700 degrees C was realized. In order to determine the corrosion resistance of the alloys, electrochemical techniques and weight loss tests were used. Electrochemical techniques applied were polarization potentiodynamic curves, open circuit potential and the linear polarization resistance. Analyses were conducted by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction to analyze the products of corrosion. It was observed that Inconel 600 and 601 showed the best corrosion resistance, however the Inconel 617 and 625 showed a low performance. It is known that Cr is responsible for the corrosion resistance; this due to the formation of the protective layer of Cr2O3, however, the Ni content plays an important role in the performance of this type of materials, as well as the other alloying elements (Al, Ti, Nd, Co and Mo).

TI Investigation on Conductive Layer, Delamination, and Recast Layer
   Characteristics of Electro-discharge Machined Holes in TBCs
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING AND PERFORMANCE
AB In this study, electrical discharge machining (EDM) is used to directly drill normal effusion cooling holes in thermal-barrier-coated nickel-based superalloys (TBCs) via the assisting electrode method. The formation of the conductive layer was studied using scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive spectroscopy. The effects of the EDM process parameters including peak current, pulse duration, and duty cycle on delamination and recast layer characteristics were investigated. The analysis results indicate that the conductive layer possesses a feature of bilayer structure for the EDM of TBCs. The bottom layer is generated first due to the deposition of carbon-based products and molten brass debris, and its composition primarily contains C, Cu, Zr, and Zn; the surface layer is the result of the overlying of subsequently molten superalloy debris and carbon-based products, and its composition primarily consists of Ni, C, Cr, Nb, Co, Al, Fe, Cu, and Zr. The microcracks of the superalloy substrate only reside in the recast layer during the EDM of TBCs. The thickness of recast layer sharply increases with increasing peak current, pulse duration, and duty cycle, respectively. The delamination occurs at the ceramic coating/bond coating interface for the EDM of drilling normal holes in TBCs, and it can be eliminated by the selection of low discharge energy and appropriate duty cycle. Additionally, the length of delamination increases with increasing peak current, pulse duration, and duty cycle, respectively. The spalling of ceramic coating appears at the entrance of the hole due to the thermal-shock brittle fracture if excessive peak current, pulse duration, or duty cycle is selected.

   elements on the carbides natures in {Ni,Co}-based {25Cr, 0.4C,
   6Ta}-containing alloys
SO CALPHAD-COMPUTER COUPLING OF PHASE DIAGRAMS AND THERMOCHEMISTRY
AB Primary carbides may be important for the high temperature strength of polycrystalline Cr-rich cast alloys. TaC are among the best carbides for this role. Their presence depends on the base elements of the alloys. This dependence is here studied in the case of a series of Cr-rich alloys based on Ni and/or Co and containing Ta and C in equal molar fractions. Real alloys were cast and exposed at 1400 K and 1510 K, and their as-cast and aged microstructures were characterized. In parallel thermodynamic calculations using Thermo-Calc and a home-made database were carried out. It appears that TaC is the single carbide present in the alloy stabilized at high temperature only if the Co content is higher than the Ni one. Discrepancies appeared between calculations and the experimental results, showing that the used database must be improved. The experimental part of this work provides microstructures data which can be used to test databases and to enrich them if necessary.

TI Protective coatings for aeronautic and power generation turbines
   components deposited by plasma spray
SO BOLETIN DE LA SOCIEDAD ESPANOLA DE CERAMICA Y VIDRIO
AB Coatings produced by aluminium diffusion, called aluminide are employed to increase the oxidation and corrosion resistance, increasing the life of Ni and Co base superalloys components at temperatures comprised between 900 and 1050 degrees C. Consequently these coatings are frequently employed in aeronautic and Fewer generation turbines as well as in the chemical industry. Aluminides are industrially produced by pack cementation or CVD and recently it has been demonstrated that its resistance significantly increases when Cr is added (chrome-aluminides). During this work, a feasibility study has been carried out in order to determine if plasma spray can be employed for depositing this type of coatings on turbine blades. Therefore, aluminium and aluminium/chromium layers were deposited on Ni base IN100 superalloy specimens that were subsequently subjected to a diffusion heat treatment under Ar flow Characterisation and analysis of the coatings were carried out by metallography, SEM and EDS. Cyclic oxidation tests were carried out at 1050 degrees C while molten sulphate hot corrosion was performed at 900 degrees C. The results of this preliminary study are promising and indicate that plasma spray can be developed as an industrial process for production of aluminide and chrome-aluminide coatings.

TI COMPOSITION OF SURFACE-FILMS ON NICKEL-BASE SUPERALLOYS
SO JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB The composition and thickness of the passive film formed on three nickel base superalloys (Inconel 718, Incoloy 925, and MP35N) in an acetate buffer (1 mol 1-1 acetic acid/1 mol 1-1 sodium acetate) was investigated using the technique of surface analysis by laser ionization (SALI).  The thickness of the films was found to be similar for the three alloys and was estimated to be 1.5 +/- 0.5 nm.  The films were all enriched in Cr but were depleted in Ni and Fe (where relevant).  Mo enrichment occurs with the Inconel, but only slightly with the Incoloy and MP35N.  The degree of Mo segregation appears to be related to the Ni content of the alloy.  The film is basically a Ni-Cr-Fe oxide on Inconel 718, a Ni-Cr-Fe-Cu oxide on Incoloy 925, and a Ni-Cr-Co oxide on MP35N.  The high Cr content of the oxides accounts in large part for the high corrosion resistance of these alloys.  MP35N further benefits from a relatively high level of Mo in the film.  The smaller amounts of Mo in the oxides on the Inconel and Incoloy are compensated to some extent by enriched levels of Nb and Cu, respectively.

TI Site preference and alloying effect of tungsten in the mu phase of
   Co7Mo6
SO PHILOSOPHICAL MAGAZINE LETTERS
AB The electronic structures of the phase of Co7Mo6 were investigated by means of first-principles calculation based on the density functional theory. The calculated equilibrium lattice parameters of Co7Mo6 are in good agreement with the experimental results. The results of calculation reveal that the addition of tungsten (W) promotes the stability of the phase of Co7Mo6 and W tends to participate in its formation. Through analysing the calculated electronic structure (partial density of states and charge density difference), it can be noted that a strong interaction exists due to d-d hybridization. Also, the majority of the atoms may contribute their valence electrons to the formation of metallic bonds in binary and ternary systems. Furthermore, the calculated results show that the doped W atom prefers to occupy the Co site in Co7Mo6 phase.

TI Microtensile creep testing of freestanding MCrAlY bond coats
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS RESEARCH
AB Bond coats are essential in gas turbine technology for oxidation protection. Freestanding MCrAlY ( M = Ni, Co) bond coats were investigated with respect to their creep strength at elevated temperatures. Three types of MCrAlY, a Ni- based bond coat Amdry 386, a Co- based bond coat Amdry 9954 and Amdry 9954 + 2 wt% Al2O3 ( ODS = oxide dispersion strengthened) produced by low pressure plasma spraying, were analyzed. The two phase microstructure of the bond coats consists of a fcc c- Ni solid solution and a B2 b- NiAl phase. Constant load experiments were performed in a thermomechanical analyzer at temperatures between 900 and 950 degrees C. Microtensile test specimens with a diameter of 450 lm were produced by a high- precision grinding and polishing process. Creep rupture was mainly due to void nucleation along the b- c interfaces and grain boundaries. The time to failure is larger in Ni- based Amdry 386 compared to that in Co- based Amdry 9954 due to a higher fraction of the high- strength b- NiAl phase at test temperatures. The addition of ODS- particles in the Co- based bond coat Amdry 9954 resulted in a better creep resistance but lower ductility in comparison to ODSparticle- free Amdry 9954.

TI Isothermal oxidation and hot corrosion behaviors of diffusion aluminide
   coatings deposited by chemical vapor deposition
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Aluminization has been employed on superalloys to form dense and adhesive alumina surface layers to prolong their service life at high temperature. A chemical vapor deposited aluminizing process had been employed to deposit nickel aluminide coatings on the nickel-based single-crystal superalloys. The kinetics behavior, phase evaluation, microstructure and chemical composition of the aluminide coatings after oxidation and hot corrosion tests were studied in detail. After isothermal oxidation test, a dense and protective alpha-Al2O3 surface layer is formed on the aluminized superalloy and phase transformation reactions occur in the aluminide layer and interdiffusion zone. The inward diffusion of Al element toward the substrate and formation of micro-pores in the interdiffusion zone are probably the main degradation modes of the aluminide coating. Corrosive medium including of mixed of aviation fuels and artificial seawater has not serious deterioration of aluminide coating after hot corrosion at 1123 K, although large of micro-pores and few of microcracks are observed within the aluminide layer, and the typical morphology of the aluminide layer becomes corse and disorder to a certain extent.

TI Effect of alloy composition on the oxidation-induced boron depletion in
   cast Ni-base superalloy components
SO MATERIALS AND CORROSION-WERKSTOFFE UND KORROSION
AB The high temperature air oxidation of the two conventionally cast Ni-based superalloys Rene 80 containing 92wtppm boron and CM 247 containing 110wtppm of boron was studied at temperatures between 850 and 1050 degrees C and times ranging from 1 to 100h. Analysis by GD-OES and SEM/WDX/EBSD revealed the surface scale on Rene 80 after exposure at 1050 degrees C to consist of Cr2O3 with TiO2 in the outer part and BCrO3 and CrTi2O5 in the inner part. Internal Al2O3 precipitates were present below the external scale. After 1h exposure of CM 247 an inner dense alumina scale formed over eutectic alloy regions containing coarse precipitates. Over dendritic regions a Cr-rich oxide scale with BCrO3-precipitates formed initially and aluminum was internally oxidized. After longer oxidation times an alumina sub-scale grew from the internal precipitates, and oxidation of the initially present depleted alloy zones resulted in formation of outer Ni and Co rich oxides. In both alloys, boron depletion in the bulk alloy occurred due to formation of the mentioned boron rich oxide. The extent of depletion was substantially higher for the chromia forming Rene 80 than for CM 247. In the latter material the boron depletion was suppressed after the formation of the dense, inner alumina scale.

SO CERAMICS INTERNATIONAL
AB In this study zirconium incorporated Cr3C2-(NiCr) coating has been sprayed on three superalloys viz. Superni 718, Superni 600 and Superco 605 using D-gun technique. A comparative study has been carried out to check the cyclic oxidation in air and hot corrosion in simulated incinerator environment (40%Na2SO4-40%K2SO4-10% NaCl-10%KCl) for the coated specimens at 900 degrees C for 100 cycles. Oxidation kinetics has been established for all the specimens using weight change measurements. Corrosion products have been characterized using X-ray diffractometer (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive analysis (SEM/EDAX). Cr3C2-(NiCr) + 0.2%wtZr coating provides very good corrosion resistance in air oxidation for all the three coated superalloys. As all the three coated superalloys shows parabolic behaviour with parabolic rate constant as 0.07 x 10(-10) (g(2) cm(-4) s(-1)) for Superni 718, 0.43 x 10(-10) (g(2) cm(-4) s(-1)) for Superni 600 and 0.3 x 10(-10) (g(2) cm(-4) s(-1)) for Superco 605 This coating is also effective in the molten salt environment but coating on Co-based superalloy Superco 605 did not perform satisfactorily. The parabolic rate constants for coated Superni 718 is 0.61 x 10-10 (g(2) cm(-4) s(-1)), for coated Superni 600 is 6.72 x 10(-1) (g(2) cm(-4) s(-1)) and for coated Superco 605 is 17.5 x 10(-10) (g(2) cm(-4) s(-1)).

AB The oxidation behaviour of ternary NixFeyCoz alloys (where x/y (wt) = 1 and 1.85: z = 0, 10, 30 and 50 wt.%) was studied in air at 800 degrees C. Alloys were found to follow complex oxidation kinetics, with the highest oxidation rates observed for alloys having 50 wt.% Co. Significant improvements in oxidation resistance were achieved by addition of 10 and 30 wt.% Co to the Ni-Fe system. The decrease in oxidation rate was associated with suppression of Fe2O3 formation in preference for (Co,Ni)(x)Fe3-xO4 growth. The results were discussed in light of the materials requirements for inert anodes for aluminium electrolysis. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   of gamma Precipitates in Co-Ti Alloys
SO RARE METAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING
AB The microstructure evolution and coarsening behaviors of disordered gamma phase in the inverse Co-19.7Ti alloy have been investigated by experiments and a phase-field method. Both the experimental and simulated results show that the morphologies of gamma phase evolve from near-spherical shape to plate-like shape as the aging time increases. The coarsening kinetics for the mean particle size obeys the cube law r(3) = kt, and it can be obtained as: (r) over bar (3)(t) = 1.126 x 10(19) t exp[-349890/RT]. There exist two distinct stages of the mean particle size increase versus aging time, the growth rate is dramatically larger in the stage 1 and has a relatively slower increase in the stage II. The summit of precipitate size distributions becomes larger and the breadth of the distributions decreases from 700 degrees C to 750 degrees C. The simulated results reproduce well the experimental results.

CL La Malbaie, CANADA
AB The interdiffusion in Co matrix/Al particle alloys and Co/Ni-based substrates was studied using electron probe microanalysis and was simulated with the software DICTRA. Alloys were prepared by mixing elemental powders and furnace melting under an inert atmosphere. The phases involved in the study were gamma (Ni-based or Co-based), beta-CoAl, and gamma'. The alloys were single-phase (gamma) as well as two-phase (gamma + beta and gamma + gamma'). Several equilibrium points in the Al-Co-Cr system were measured and compared with the calculated diagram at 1100 degreesC. The diffusion couples were prepared to produce combinations of selected alloys and were subjected to annealing at 1100 degreesC for times up to 72 h. The diffusion calculations made with DICTRA were performed using the TCNI1 thermodynamic database together with mobility data collected from different literature sources. A literature survey on diffusion data of this system was performed, and comparisons with available data were made. The validity of the selected mobility data was checked with the composition profiles measured on some single-phase gamma/gamma diffusion couples. In the gamma + beta/gamma and gamma/gamma + gamma' diffusion couples, a regression of the dispersed phase (P or gamma') was observed due to the interdiffusion of Al. From combined experimental and theoretical results, the effects of temperature and coating thickness were determined as an input for a coating lifetime prediction model.

The Nb-containing alloy was found to exhibit improved tensile and creep properties as well as superior oxidation resistance compared with both RR1000 and the Nb-free variant tested. The beneficial effect of Nb on the tensile and creep properties was due to the microstructures obtained following the post-solution heat treatments, which led to a higher gamma' volume fraction and a finer tertiary gamma' distribution. In addition, an increase in the anti-phase-boundary energy of the gamma' phase is also expected with the addition of Nb, further contributing to the strength of the material. However, these modifications in the gamma' distribution detrimentally affect the dwell fatigue crack-growth behavior of the material, although this behavior can be improved through modified heat treatments. The oxidation resistance of the Nb-containing alloy was also enhanced as Nb is believed to accelerate the formation of a defect-free Cr2O3 scale. Overall, both developmental alloys, with and without the addition of Nb, were found to exhibit superior properties than RR1000.

AB Oxyfuel combustion efforts to burn fossil fuels with oxygen, for easier post-combustion CO2 capture, include schemes to use flue gas to drive turbines for power generation. The environment examined here is 10% CO2 and 0.2% O-2, with the balance being steam, with temperatures ranging from 630 to 821 degrees C. The relatively high C and O-2 activities of this environment, as compared to pure steam, may lead to changes in oxidation behavior and mechanical properties. Oxidation coupons of Ni- and Co-base superalloys, in both bare metal and TBC coated conditions, were exposed to this environment for up to 1000 hours. The results of these exposures, in terms of mass gain and scale morphology, are presented.

TI Plastic deformation of polycrystals of Co-3(Al, W) with the L1(2)
   structure
SO PHILOSOPHICAL MAGAZINE
AB The plastic behaviour of Co-3(Al, W) polycrystals with the L1(2) structure has been investigated in compression from 77 to 1273 K. The yield stress exhibits a rapid decrease at low temperatures (up to room temperature) followed by a plateau (up to 950 K), then it increases anomalously with temperature in a narrow temperature range between 950 and 1100 K, followed again by a rapid decrease at high temperatures. Slip is observed to occur exclusively on {111} planes at all temperatures investigated. The rapid decrease in yield stress observed at low temperatures is ascribed to a thermal component of solid-solution hardening that occurs during the motion of APB-coupled dislocations whose core adopts a planar, glissile structure. The anomalous increase in yield stress is consistent with the thermally activated cross-slip of APB-coupled dislocations from (111) to (010), as for many other L1(2) compounds. Similarities and differences in the deformation behaviour and operating mechanisms among Co-3(Al, W) and other L1(2) compounds, such as Ni3Al and Co3Ti, are discussed.

TI Microstructure and Mechanical Properties of Co-Al-W-Ta-Nb Alloys at

SO RARE METAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING
AB The microstructural evolution and room/high-temperature mechanical properties were investigated for a Co-9Al-9W-2Ta alloy with 4at%, 6at% and 9at% Nb additions to replace the same content of W (referred as to 4Nb, 6Nb and 9Nb alloy hereafter, 0Nb for the alloy without Nb addition, and the content of W+Nb=9 at% for all alloys) prepared by arc-melting. Results show that the as-cast alloys exhibit a microstructure composed of Co-base solid solution gamma phase (gamma-Co-ss) and eutectic of gamma+ intermetallic compound Co3Nb. While after 1200 degrees C, 8 h solution and 800 degrees C, 100 h aging, the cubic gamma' phase with a size of 200 similar to 300 nm precipitates homogeneously and coherently on the gamma matrix for the 0Nb similar to 6Nb alloys. Besides, cellular and/or needle-like Co3Nb phases are found in the 4Nb similar to 9Nb alloy. The 6Nb alloy shows the highest yield strength in the temperature range of 600 similar to 700 degrees C, while the 4Nb alloy has the highest strength at 800 degrees C. Alloys exhibit yield stress anomalies at temperatures above 600 C, and the temperature corresponding to the anomaly stress peak is about 700 degrees C.

TI Plastic deformation behaviors and mechanical properties of advanced

SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB With the aim of achieving an enhanced high-temperature strength compared to the Co-Ni-Al-W-Ti-Ta alloy from our previous study, a new single crystalline CoNi-base superalloy has been developed based on thermodynamic calculations. The gamma' solvus temperature and the gamma' volume fraction were experimentally determined as 1247 degrees C and 85.2%. Thermodynamic calculations correctly predict the tendency of how the alloying elements influence the thermophysical properties of investigated alloys. In comparison with the original Co-Ni-Al-W-Ti-Ta alloy, the newly developed CoNi-base alloy exhibited stronger compressive strength ranging from the room temperature to 1100 degrees C. The deformation behaviors at different temperature stages were investigated in detail. Interestingly, superlattice intrinsic stacking faults (SISFs) appear in the specimen deformed at the anomalous peak temperature, whereas the formation of SISF in the original Co-Ni-Al-W-Ti-Ta alloy occurs as the compression temperature increases beyond the anomalous peak temperature. The relationship between the occurrence of planar defects and the alloying effects was discussed.

TI The Thermal Stability and Strength of Highly Alloyed Ni3Al
SO MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS
AB In this study the Ll(2) gamma prime phase (based on Ni3Al) has been highly alloyed with Cr, Co, W, and Ta in order to examine the effects on strengthening and thermal stability. The order-disorder transition temperature of gamma prime is decreased with higher alloying content. Thermodynamic calculations show that the ordering enthalpy decreases as the entropy term increases. Conversely, the hardness can be 1.5 times higher comparing to that of a conventional Ni-based superalloy. This indicates that the strengthening effect of designing a gamma prime composition toward higher entropy is significant, due to greater lattice distortion and higher anti-phase boundary energy of gamma prime.

TI The grain boundary pinning effect of the mu phase in an advanced
   polycrystalline gamma/gamma' Co-base superalloy
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB A grain boundary pinning phase was introduced into a gamma/gamma' Co-base superalloy by the addition of Mo. The intermetallic phase was identified as mu phase (Co,Ni,Cr)(7)(W,Mo)6 by high-energy X-ray diffraction and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy in the transmission electron microscope. Synchrotron radiation insitu heating experiments confirmed the stability of the grain structure up to 1050 degrees C and therefore the grain boundary pinning effect of this phase. Recrystallization heat treatments at different temperatures resulted in varying amounts of mu phase. The grain size analysis revealed that at least 1% of the phase is necessary to maintain a pinning effect during recrystallization. Atom probe tomography confirmed that Mo partitioned predominantly to the gamma phase. Since the mu phase and the gamma' phase are competing for W, a lower gamma volume fraction was formed in comparison to a Mo-free polycrystalline gamma/gamma' Co-base superalloy variant. However, the homogeneous distribution of small grains resulted in a higher strength compared to the Mo-free alloy without grain boundary pinning phases. The creep resistance at 750 degrees C was similar to the Mo-free alloy as well as the polycrystalline Ni-base superalloy U720Li with a creep rate minimum of 1.5 x 10(-7) s(-1) at 620 MPa.

TI Diffusion processes in multicomponent nickel-base superalloy-nickel
   system
SO PHYSICS OF METALS AND METALLOGRAPHY
AB Optical and scanning electron microscopy, as well as electron microprobe analysis and electron backscatter diffraction, have been used to study diffusion processes that occur in a diffusion pair that consistsof a single-crystal CMSX-10 nickel-base superalloy and polycrystalline nickel, at temperatures of 1050-1250A degrees C. It has been found that, in this system, the distributions of gamma-stabilizing elements (Cr, Co, W, and Re) are described by the Boltzmann solution for diffusion between two semiinfinite plates of a binary alloy. The processing of these distributions has shown that the diffusion coefficients of Cr, Co, W, and Re in the multicomponent system are close to those in binary alloys of these elements with Ni. The diffusion redistribution of the elements leads to the dissolution of the gamma' phase in the nickel-base superalloy, growth of nickel grains toward the superalloy constituent of the diffusion pair, and the formation of porosity on both sides of the migrating interface, which is determined from a crystal misorientation of the alloy single crystal and nickel grains.

TI Microstructural changes as postmortem temperature indicator in

SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB Microstructural changes in a metallic oxidation protection coating (Ni-Co-Cr-Al-Y) applied on a nickel base superalloy were investigated by means of scanning and transmission electron microscopy. The changes are due either to thermal mechanical fatigue testing under high thermal gradients or to defined isothermal heat treatments. The coated specimens were quenched from temperatures between 840 and 1100degreesC to ambient temperature. The resultant phases, their local distribution and compositions were determined by energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy and electron diffraction. Phase equilibria at respective temperatures were determined by thermodynamic calculations based on the CALPHAD method. The calculated and experimentally determined phase distributions were compared. A particular microstructural feature, namely the existence and spatial distribution of spherical gamma' Ni3Al precipitates in the coating and the diffusion zone between substrate and coating, was used as a postmortem indicator for the maximum temperature experienced by the specimen during testing. This paper gives a road map for developing a microstructural-based temperature calibration for complex metallic materials using thermodynamic simulations. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The solidified process of the rhenium-containing nickel-based superalloys was investigated in this paper. The solidified experiments of samples were carried out in a silicon carbon tube furnace with following water quenching. Microstructure of samples and subsequent compositional analysis of solidified ones were determined by an optical microscope (OM) and electronic probe micro analysis (EPMA), respectively. The results show the initial temperature, final temperature and the temperature interval of solidification keep constant with increasing content of Re in alloys under the test conditions, demonstrating the similar solidification sequences. With increasing Re element in alloy, the segregation coefficient of Al, Cr, Co, Mo, and Ta slightly varies, but the segregation coefficient of W obviously decreases.

TI Hot corrosion of protective coatings
SO MATERIALS AND MANUFACTURING PROCESSES
AB Improvement in efficiencies of gas turbine engines requires a significant increase of gas inlet temperatures. This results in an increased service temperature for blade materials and consequently in enhanced oxidation and hot corrosion attack of the blade coatings, which are usually of MCrAlY type where M is Ni, Co or NiCo. This type of coating can provide protection against oxidation and hot corrosion and act as a bond coat for thermal barrier coating systems. In both cases slow growth rates and optimum adherence of the alumina scales forming on the MCrAlY coatings during high temperature exposure are significant for component life. The above mentioned properties for the alumina scales strongly depend on the coating base composition as well as on the presence of minor alloying elements. In the present paper the performance of existing superalloys during hot corrosion is briefly described followed by the results obtained on hot corrosion of MCRAlY type coatings explaining the effect of trace elements on the life of coatings in the presence of NaCl and vanadium containing environments. Optimum thickness to improve the life of superalloys with NiCoCrAlY as a bond coat and yttria stabilized zirconia thermal barrier coatings has been identified. Based on the results, an electrochemical mechanism is proposed and shows that hot corrosion of protective coatings is an electrochemical phenomenon. Hence electrochemical techniques appear to be quite useful in evaluating the coatings for hot corrosion resistance.

AB Multilayered MCrAlY type coatings have the potential to be optimised to protect superalloy components against both corrosion and oxidation simultaneously. In this paper, a dual layered coating (NiCr(Co)AlY on top of a NiCoCrAlY coating) has been aged and the microstructural evolution has been observed and quantified using various electron microscopy based techniques. In addition, the microstructural evolution of the coating has been modelled using a diffusion based model capable of predicting the ageing of multilayer coatings. It is demonstrated that the model is reasonably accurate in predicting both the phase and chemical distributions through the coating system during ageing, and therefore has the potential to be used as a design tool for the improvement of future layered coating systems.

SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB High-velocity oxygen-fuel (HVOF) process is one of the most popular thermal spraying technologies and has been widely adopted by many industries due to its flexibility and the superior quality of coatings produced. This paper demonstrates the successful application of Stellite-6 metallic coatings on the Ni- and Fe-based superalloys by HVOF process for hot corrosion applications. The microstructure, porosity, coating thickness, phase formation and microhardness properties of the coatings were characterised using the combined techniques of optical microscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive analysis (SEM/EDAX) and electron probe microanalysis (EPMA). The coatings exhibited characteristic splatlike, layered morphologies due to the deposition and re-solidification of successive molten or semi-molten powder particles. The coating possesses porosity, unmelted and semimelted particles, and inclusions. The coatings have porosity less than 2% and hardness values in the range of 800-900 Hv. The as sprayed microstructure has a face centred cubic (fec) Co-rich metallic matrix with very small fraction of CoNiO2 spinet oxide. EDAX analysis of the coating microstructure confirmed that the coating composition is similar to the feedstock powder. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SO OXIDATION OF METALS
AB In this study, the cyclic corrosion behavior of N06230, N07263, and N06625 in a LiCl-Li2O molten salt was investigated at 650 A degrees C in argon atmosphere. The cyclic corrosion behavior was observed through measurements of the oxide morphology and thickness, the extent of internal corrosion, and compositional changes in the oxide scale and the substrate. The corrosion products in the surface corrosion layers of N07263 were (Ni,Co)O, (Ni,Co)Cr2O4, Cr2O3, and TiO2 and those in the surface corrosion layers of N06230 were NiO, NiCr2O4, and Cr2O3, while NiO, NiCr2O4, CrNbO4, and Cr2O3 were identified as the corrosion products of N06625. The internal corrosion behavior of N07263 was localized, while N06230 and N06625 showed uniform corrosion. N07263 exhibited superior corrosion resistance as its corrosion layer was more continuous, dense, and adherent as compared to those of N06230 and N06625.

AB The phase equilibria between the gamma (A1) and liquid phases and those between the gamma, epsilon (A3), sigma (D8(b)) and alpha (A2) phases at temperatures between 750 and 1300 A degrees C in the Co-Cr-Ni system were determined by differential scanning calorimetry and electron probe microanalysis. It was found that the gamma solidus and liquidus temperatures decrease with increasing Cr or Ni content and that the difference between them increases with increasing Cr content. The phase equilibria at 800, 900, 1000, 1100, 1200 and 1300 A degrees C were determined using two- or three-phase alloys, and the phase boundaries due to the magnetically induced phase separation in the gamma and epsilon phases were also observed at 850, 800 and 750 A degrees C by the diffusion couple method.

AB Several alloys of Ni-Al-Cr-Co system with Ni content close to 60 at.% were prepared and annealed at 1273 and 1373 K with the aim to reach the state of thermodynamic equilibrium. The microstructure of quenched samples was studied by means of scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Phases equilibrated at high temperature were identified using selected area diffraction in transmission electron microscope. Energy dispersive X-ray analysis was used for evaluation of nominal alloy compositions as well as the chemical composition of individual phases. The results obtained experimentally are compared with the results of thermodynamic calculation using software ThermoCalc and a commercial database of thermodynamic data for Ni-based alloys. In most cases the results of calculation show good agreement with experiment. A few differences of the results obtained by the two approaches are pointed out and briefly discussed.

TI Vacancy mediated alloying strengthening effects on gamma/gamma '
   interface of Ni-based single crystal superalloys: A first-principles
   study
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB The vacancy effects on the site preferences of alloying elements Re, Mo, Ta and Cr at gamma/gamma' interface are studied using first-principles density functional theory. The alloying strengthening mechanism mediated by vacancy is also evaluated via calculating the Griffith work of fracture for gamma/gamma' interface as well as the energy barrier of vacancy migration at the interface. The calculated results show that a Ni vacancy on (001)gamma' plane does not change the most preferable substitution position of the alloying elements at corner-point Ni site on (001)gamma except Cr. These alloying elements in gamma' enhance the interfacial bonding strength of gamma/gamma' interface even with the presence of a neighboring vacancy, among which Re exhibits the best strengthening effect. The improvement in the gamma/gamma' interfacial strength is ascribed to the increased chemical bonding strength between the alloying atom and the nearest-neighbor host atom. Furthermore, a single Ni vacancy has higher migration energy barriers around the alloying solutes especially Re solute substituting on (001)gamma at gamma/gamma' interface, although the alloying solutes at these preferable sites have no contribution to the interfacial bonding strength.

AB The high-temperature Co-Re alloy [1], a promising candidate for gas turbine applications, has a complex microstructure containing various kinds of precipitates in different size scales. The nano-sized fine spherical TaC (< 100 nm) precipitates are the most important for strengthening of the alloy. In this contribution the influence of Cr addition (5 at.% and 15 at.%) on the strengthening TaC precipitates in Co-Re-Ta-C alloy with a C/Ta ratio of 0.9 is studied. The Cr content is important for the oxidation resistance of the alloy, but it also influences the size and volume fraction of TaC precipitates and consequently the possible formation of the Cr-rich Cr2Re3 (sigma phase) and Cr23C6 precipitates. In addition, Cr influences the temperature of the allotropic phase transformation of the Co matrix phase. It was found that additions of 5 at.% or 15 at.% Cr in the alloy does not result in the formation of Cr2Re3 and Cr23C6 phases. Further, the addition of such smaller amounts of Cr does not retain the Co gamma (fcc) phase (stable or metastable) at room temperature after cooling from high temperatures. Only the e (hcp) phase is present at low temperatures. The TaC precipitates are slightly influenced in size and volume fraction with 5 at.% and 15 at.% Cr.

TI Homogenization heat treatment and segregation analysis of equiaxed
   CMSX-4 superalloy for gas turbine components
SO JOURNAL OF THERMAL ANALYSIS AND CALORIMETRY
AB Homogenization heat treatment and segregation analysis of equiaxed CMSX-4 nickel-based superalloy were investigated. The researches were focused on studying the influence of a multi-cycle heat treatment on the evolution of CMSX-4 superalloy in terms of microstructure and porosity. The heat treatment temperature was selected based on the chemical composition of superalloy and thermodynamic calculations of solidification path and phase formation using a thermodynamic software. Elemental partition coefficients were calculated using the local chemical compositions in different areas of the samples, before and after each heat treatment cycle. It was observed that Al, Ti and Ta segregate in the interdendritic regions and eutectic gamma-gamma' pools, while W, Re and Co segregate mainly in the dendrite cores and the dendrite arms. The compositional analysis shows an increase in the structure homogeneity after the heat treatment, but a certain compositional gradient between the dendrite cores and the interdendritic regions is still observed. The qualitative analysis based on the backscattered electron images sustains the results obtained from the compositional analysis regarding the homogenization of the alloy. A descending evolution of the cuboidal gamma' phase was observed until 6 h of holding, but after 9 h of holding at 1573 K the size of cuboidal gamma' phase starts to grow especially in the interdendritic regions. After long temperature holding time, a notable increase in porosity level was observed due to the partition coefficients of the alloying elements and dissolution of the residual phases (eutectic gamma-gamma' pools, coarse gamma').

SO COMPUTATIONAL CONDENSED MATTER
AB Using the first-principles calculations based on the density functional theory, we studied the site occupancy of Re in the Co7W6 mu phase and its effects on the electronic properties. The results of binding energy and defect formation energy show that the stability of the system was enhanced after Re doping, which indicates that Re is prone to the Co7W6 mu phase formation. The results of electronic properties calculations (the density of states and charge density difference) reveal that there exists a strong interaction between Re and its NN(nearest neighborhood) atoms, which was attributed to the d-d hybridization. Besides, the bonding strength becomes stronger as Re substituting the Co sites, which further elucidate that Re preferentially occupies the Co sites. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Eight Ru-containing single crystal Ni-base superalloys were devised and evaluated using a design of experiments approach to isolate the effects of four elements, namely Co, Mo, W and Ru, on creep, plain low-cycle fatigue (LCF), 1100 degrees C cyclic oxidation and thermal barrier coating (TBC) compatibility. All the alloys compared favourably to CMSX-4 mechanically, however, they underperformed in oxidation. Mo and Co were found to adversely affect both the cyclic oxidation performance and TBC compatibility. None of the four factorials were found to have a statistically significant impact on LCF. In general, the largest creep temperature benefits over CMSX-4 were observed at low (< 800 degrees C) and high (> 1000 degrees C) temperatures. At intermediate temperatures (-850 degrees C to 950 degrees C) the improvement in temperature capability was less pronounced. Mo was found to have the only statistically significant contribution on creep. Consistent with the correlation between lattice misfit and creep, the impact was positive at low temperatures/high stresses and negative at intermediate conditions. As misfit increases in low temperature creep the density of dislocations in the gamma' decreases and the number of stacking faults in the gamma channels increases. The latter culminates in a negative misfit threshold above which primary creep is effectively 'turned off. Under intermediate creep conditions, high negative misfit alloys spontaneously develop a 'labyrinth' structure that comprises approximately equal numbers of rafts in all three < 001 > directions irrespective of the direction of the applied stress. This tendency for labyrinth rafting imposes an upper limit on the magnitude of the negative misfit and thus the degree to which the gamma-matrix can be usefully strengthened with refractory elements at intermediate temperatures.

   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB Slip band-grain boundary interactions of gamma'-Co-3(Al,W)-strengthened Co-9Al-4.5Mo-4.5Mo-2Ta-0.02B-(0.01, 0.1)Ce alloys (referred to as 0.01Ce alloy and 0.1Ce alloy, respectively, hereafter) were investigated in-situ using SEM and TEM. For the 0.01Ce alloy with a gamma/gamma'-Co-3(Al, W) coherent microstructure, the {1 1 1} < 1 1 0 > dislocations initiate in the gamma channels and subsequently cut into the neighbouring gamma' phase. A low-angle grain boundary (LAGB) is necessary for the slip band transfer mechanism. The slip bands transfer through the LAGB when the alignment factor M > 0.8 with the incoming easy-slip system and the Schmid factor > 0.3 on the outgoing slip system. The high-angle grain boundaries (HAGBs) usually have a low M value and the incoming slip bands are blocked at the HAGBs without transfer; instead, independent slip systems with the highest Schmid factor in the neighbouring grain are activated. The plastic deformation of the gamma/gamma'-Co-3(Al,W) microstructure and the slip band-grain boundary interactions lead to an elongation of 16.4% of the 0.01Ce alloy. With some Co3W precipitates at the grain boundary of the 0.1Ce alloy, the slip bands bypass, cut through, or sometimes are arrested by the precipitates, resulting in a low elongation of 2.1% and a mixed dimple and cleavage failure.

TI Effect of Ru on the Oxidation Behavior of a Ni-Base Single-Crystal
   Superalloy
SO SCIENCE OF ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB The effect of Ru on the isothermal oxidation of Ni-base single crystal superalloys has been investigated by discontinuous thermogravimetric analysis. The scale structures were analyzed using XRD, SEM and EDX. The kinetic curves of the alloys exposed at 1000 degrees C and 1100 degrees C obeyed the parabolic law, and the addition of Ru had minimal direct effect on the oxide phase types. The scales for three alloys with various Ru additions were mainly composed of an outer (Ni, Co) O layer, a second complex oxides layer, and an inner Al2O3 layer. The spallation of the scale was observed after a long time oxidation at 1000 degrees C and 1100 degrees C. The mass gains of the alloys with Ru addition were higher than those of the alloys without Ru addition when exposed to high temperatures at 1000 degrees C and 1100 degrees C. This showed that the addition of Ru can reduce the oxidation resistance in the alloy oxidation at high temperatures due to Ru inhibiting the formation of Al2O3 layer. Furthermore, the rate of oxidation for the alloy with 3 Ru addition at 1100 degrees C was slower than that of the alloy with 1.5 Ru addition since the weak-bond in NiWO4 was limited by Ru addition. The internal nitride was obtained from the three alloys with Ru addition due to the loose Al2O3 films.

TI Microstructure assessment at high temperature in NiCoCrAlY overlay
   coating obtained by laser metal deposition
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY-JMR&T
AB Laser metal deposition (LMD) and laser cladding (LC) could be innovative methods to the current thermal spray techniques for obtaining dense and high-quality bond coats with nickel and cobalt based superalloys in thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) systems. The microstructural evolution of the coatings when is subjected to high temperatures allows us to evaluate their oxidation behavior and integrity in the time, and is especially important in the development of bond coats for new TBCs systems. In this work, the microstructural evolution of a dense NiCoCrAlY overlay coating obtained by coaxial laser cladding and subjected to isothermal oxidation tests at 1100 degrees C up to 200 h was evaluated. The initial coating microstructure is composed of a beta-NiAl phase within the gamma-Ni matrix phase, and some Y inclusions, confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). At high temperature, the thermally-grown oxides (TGO) protect the underlying coating and substrate from oxidation, modifying the initial microstructure of the coating. The formation, morphology and evolution of oxides alpha-Al2O3, Y2O3, YA1O(3) and (Ni,Co)(AlCr2)(2) O-4-type spinel oxides on the cross section of the oxidized coating on different oxidation stages were evaluated using focused ion beam (FIB) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), and indexed by XRD and TEM. After oxidation tests, no cracks or spallation on oxidized sample for NiCoCrAlY coating were observed, and the formation of Y-Al oxides in TGO scale are strongly dependent on the initial Y distribution of as-built condition in the coating.

AB Co-Re-based alloys are candidates for high-temperature applications in gas turbines. The addition of boron largely increases their ductility. The stability of the Co-solid solution matrix and of the strengthening TaC minority phase at the foreseen alloy operation temperatures (>= 1200 degrees C), potentially influenced by the presence of boron, has to be considered. The hcp to fcc transformation of the Co-solid solution matrix and the TaC minority phase evolution was thus investigated in Co-Re-Ta-C alloy with varying boron addition by in situ neutron diffraction at temperatures up to 1500 degrees C in high vacuum furnace. The neutron diffraction showed that the boron addition has no significant influence on TaC volume fraction during heating to high temperatures. In 0, 0.1, and 0.4 at.% B alloys, a strong decrease of the TaC volume fraction was observed above 1300 degrees C. Nevertheless, TaC has significant volume fraction up to that temperature and, therefore, can be effective for strengthening. The measurements further showed that while a small amount of boron addition (0.1 at.% B) has no influence on the matrix transformation and its hysteresis, a large boron addition (0.4 at.% B) influences the matrix transformation temperature significantly (lowers it by about 100 K) and, moreover, boron promotes massive Co sublimation at very high temperatures (>= 1470 degrees C). Further, re-appearance of the hcp phase around 1400 degrees C in 0.4 at.% B alloy was observed and explained by a slow sublimation of Co in high vacuum. It is not a problem from the technological point of view as vacuum is not a turbine operation condition, and as the high-temperature components are regularly protected by a coating.

TI Wetting and interfacial behavior of Ni-Si alloy on different substrates
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Wetting of molten Ni-56 at.% Si alloy on different substrates (SiC ceramic, Ni- and Co-based superalloys, Kovar, and Mo) are performed under different experimental conditions by the sessile drop technique. Temperature, atmosphere, and substrate composition play the key roles in determining the wettability, the spreading characteristics, and the interfacial morphology of the final interfaces. The non-reactive wetting characteristics in Ni-Si/SiC system are confirmed, with a spreading rate increasing with temperature increasing. In the Ni-Si/metal systems the spreading process is determined by the competition between spreading along the substrate surface and the interfacial interactions. Excellent wettability and fast spreading are found in the Ni-Si/Co-based superalloy, Ni-Si/Kovar, and Ni-Si/Mo systems at both the temperatures (1100 and 1200 A degrees C). These results can be used as a reference guide for joining SiC to these metallic components, or to itself, using the Ni-Si alloy as filler metal.

TI The influence of Mo on Suzuki-segregation-related microstructure
   evolution and mechanical properties of Co-Ni-based superalloy
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Mo, as one of the most important elements in superalloy, dramatically affected the microstructure and mechanical properties via solution strengthening, forming Mo-enriched phase, and atomic segregation (Suzuki effect). To verify the influence of Mo on the microstructure and mechanical properties of Ni-Co-based superalloy, two types of alloys containing 4 wt% (A4) and 8 wt% (A8) Mo were prepared. The microstructure was examined using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope, and transmission electron microscope, while the mechanical properties were evaluated using tensile tests at both room temperature and elevated temperature (700 degrees C). The segregation of Mo at stacking faults was observed in both alloys after aging with pre-cold-rolling. At the same time, in alloy A8, direct precipitation of mu phase both along grain boundary and in the interior of matrix was observed after aging. In alloy A4, segregation of Mo along stacking fault ribbons resulted in formation of quasi-mu phase. The quasi-mu phase developed into mu phase during prolonged aging. There was no precipitate along grain boundary in A4 after aging resulting in poor ductility at both room and elevated temperature. The strength was enhanced by net effect of Suzuki segregation, gamma' phase strengthening, and fine mu phase. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Microstructure properties of HVOF-sprayed NiCrBSi/WCCo-based composite
   coatings on AISI 1040 steel
SO OPTOELECTRONICS AND ADVANCED MATERIALS-RAPID COMMUNICATIONS
AB NiCrBSi/WCCo-based composite coatings were produced on the surface of AISI 1040 steel using high velocity oxygen fuel (HVOF) thermal spraying technique. In the coatings produced, the WCCo quantity added to the NiCrBSi was chosen as 10, 30 and 50 wt. % percentages. The coatings were compared in terms of their phase composition, microstructure, and hardness. Phase composition and microstructure of the coatings were characterised using X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. The results indicated that the as-prepared NiCrBSi/WCCo-based composite coatings were mainly composed of Upsilon-Ni, WC, W2C, Cr23C6, Cr7C3, CrB2, CrSi, and Co phases. Microhardness values of coating layer varied according to the addition of the powder. The highest microhardness value of the coating was measured as 1300 HV0.2.

TI Atomic mobility evaluation and diffusion matrix for fcc_A1 Co-V-W alloys
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB On the basis of measured interdiffusivity matrices from our previous research and thermodynamic descriptions, atomic mobilities for fcc_A1 Co-V-W alloys were evaluated by diffusion controlled transformation software. For the purpose of verifying the reliability of the present atomic mobilities, comparisons between the predicted data containing interdiffusivity matrices, composition profiles, as well as diffusion paths and the experimental ones were conducted. The results demonstrate that presently obtained atomic mobilities can reproduce experimental data reasonably. Furthermore, three-dimensional surfaces for the diagonal interdiffusivities at 1373, 1423 and 1473K were plotted and were compared with measured ones, from which the pre-exponential factor and activation energy for elements V and W were then derived by means of Arrhenius equation. It is worth mentioning that all of the composition profiles and diffusion paths at three temperatures can be reasonably predicted by the present atomic mobilities containing only two ternary interaction parameters. Such a high simulation accuracy is rarely reported in the literature. The present atomic mobilities contribute to computational design for novel Co-based superalloys and multi-component cemented carbides.

TI Improvement of tensile behaviours of a gamma'-Co3(Al, W) strengthened
   polycrystalline Co-9Al-4.5W-4.5Mo-2Ta-0.02B alloy at room-and
   high-temperatures by doping Ce
SO PROGRESS IN NATURAL SCIENCE-MATERIALS INTERNATIONAL
AB The microstructures and tensile behaviours of cerium (Ce) doped polycrystalline Co-9Al-4.5W-4.5Mo-2Ta-0.02B alloys (doped 0.05 and 0.2 at.% Ce) at room temperature (RT) and 600-800 degrees C were investigated. In-suit tensile test under SEM was conducted to understand the deformation and damage mechanisms at RT. Aged at 800 degrees C for 50 h, the 0.05Ce alloy consisted of a Co solid-solution matrix (gamma-Co-SS) and nano-scale cuboidal gamma'-Co-3(Al, W) precipitates, while for the 0.2Ce alloy, kappa-Co-3(W, Mo) precipitates and gamma'-depleted zone were present at the grain boundaries in addition to the gamma/gamma' microstructure. The 0.05Ce alloy exhibited flow stress anomalies at 700 degrees C. With higher Sigma 1 similar to 3 boundary fraction and cleaned-up grain boundary, the 0.05Ce alloy always showed greater strength and elongation than the 0.2 Ce alloy with the grain boundary precipitates at temperatures up to 800 degrees C. Doped 0.05 at.% Ce made the Co-9Al-4.5W-4.5Mo-2Ta-0.02B alloy have an excellent elongation of 6.1% at 700 degrees C, owing to a mixed transgranular dimple plus intergranular cleavage fracture. The slip bands transferring through the low-angle grain boundary and slipping of the gamma'-Co-3(Al, W) in the 0.5Ce alloy resulted in excellent ductility of 20.4% at RT.

SO CORROSION SCIENCE
AB The oxidation behaviour of single crystal PWA 1483 at 950 degrees C was investigated by means of XRD, SEM and EDS. The Parabolic oxidation behaviour, as defined by mass gain and the respective oxide layer thicknesses, is characterized by a parabolic rate constant of about 4 x 10(-6) mg(2)/(cm(4) x s) and the formation of a multi-layered oxide scale. An outer scale contains a Ti-bearing thin film composed of TiO2 and NiTiO3 but mostly Cr in Cr2O3 and (Ni/Co)Cr2O4 besides NiTaO4. This outer scale is connected to a discontinuous layer of Al2O3 and an area of gamma'-depletion within the base material. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Mechanism of Al-Si codeposition on In738LC through single-step diffusion
   process
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SURFACE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
AB The out-of-pack cementation method was applied to coat the Nickel-based super alloy IN738LC with Si-modified aluminide. Different mixtures of the pack containing pure Al, Si, alumina powders as an inert filler, and NH4Cl as a halide salt activator were used for co-deposition at 950 and 1,050 degrees C. The results showed although the amount of subhalide vapour pressures of Al and Si were equal at 1,050 degrees C, Al atoms diffused only after Si atoms had been deposited. Before heat treatment, the coating thickness formed by the pack containing 2.3 wt.% Al was 6 mu m more than that containing 3.5 wt.% Al. After heat treatment, thickening coatings formed within the pack containing 2.3 wt.% Al was less than that obtained in the other pack containing 3.5 wt.% Al. This study suggests that increasing the depositing temperature will increase the thickness at a constant composition of the pack powder.

TI On the control of structural/compositional ratio of coherent
   order-disorder interfaces
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Order-disorder coherent interfaces determine the microstructure and mechanical properties of precipitation-hardened high-temperature alloys. The characteristics of these interfaces can be defined by a compositional width, delta, and structural width, delta'. The latter, which can be considered as the width of the ordered part of the interface, can play an important role in high-temperature mechanical behavior of precipitation-hardened alloys. This is due to the fact that diffusion in the ordered part of the interface is generally much slower than diffusion in the disordered phase, thus hindering the solid-state diffusion-based phenomena. Here, we investigate the order-disorder interface in a Ni-19Al (at.%) alloy as a model alloy for Ni-based superalloys using atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy and three-dimensional atom probe tomography. Then, we employ thermodynamic modeling to describe the interplay between the structural and compositional interface widths in binary Ni-Al and in ternary Ni-Al-Cr and Co-Al-W systems. We introduce the delta'/delta ratio as a critical parameter that varies significantly in different alloys. Our findings offer a general pathway to control the delta'/delta ratio of interfaces, which in turn affect the high-temperature properties of precipitation-hardened alloys. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

TI The influence of C/Ta ratio on TaC precipitates in Co-Re base alloys
   investigated by small-angle neutron scattering
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB Co-Re alloys are being developed to supplement Ni-base superalloys in future gas turbines for ultra-high temperature applications. The finely distributed mono-carbide phase of TaC is an important strengthening phase in this alloy, and interacts with dislocations during high temperature creep deformation. This study aims to determine and to understand the volume fraction and size distribution of TaC precipitates in dependence of C/Ta stoichiometry and heat treatment by means of in-situ small-angle neutron scattering. At measuring temperatures of 1173 K, 1373 K and 1473 K, a stable population of fine TaC <100 nm size is formed during ageing for a wide range of C/Ta stoichiometry but with considerably different volume fraction and coarsening behavior. Important parameters for mechanical properties of the material, such as particle size distribution and inter-particle distance, were determined. It is shown that the phase transformation from gamma-matrix (fcc) <-> epsilon-matrix (hcp) of the Co-Re matrix has a considerable influence on the TaC precipitate formation.

TI Improved High-Temperature Microstructural Stability and Creep Property
   of Novel Co-Base Single-Crystal Alloys Containing Ta and Ti
SO JOM
AB The influence of Ta and Ti additions on microstructural stability and creep behavior in novel Co-Al-W base single-crystal alloys has been investigated. Compared to the ternary alloy, the gamma' solvus temperature and gamma' volume fraction were raised by individual additions of Ta and Ti, and increased further in the quinary alloy containing both alloying additions. In contrast to ternary and quaternary alloys, an improved microstructural stability with the stable gamma-gamma' two-phase microstructure and more than 60% gamma' volume fraction existed in the quinary alloy after prolonged aging treatment at 1050 degrees C for 1000 h. The creep behavior at 900 degrees C revealed lower creep rates and longer rupture lives in the quaternary alloys compared to the ternary alloy, whereas the quinary alloy exhibited even better creep resistance. When the creep temperature was elevated to about 1000 degrees C, the creep resistance of the quinary alloy exceeded the previously reported Co-Al-W-base alloys and first-generation Ni-base single-crystal superalloys. The improved creep resistance at approximately 1000 degrees C was considered to be associated with high gamma' volume fraction, gamma' directional coarsening, and dislocation substructure, which included gamma-gamma' interfacial dislocation networks and the sheared gamma' precipitates containing stacking faults and anti-phase boundaries.

SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB We formulate a materials design strategy combining a machine learning (ML) surrogate model with experimental design algorithms to search for high entropy alloys (HEAs) with large hardness in a model Al-Co-Cr-Cu-Fe-Ni system. We fabricated several alloys with hardness 10% higher than the best value in the original training dataset via only seven experiments. We find that a strategy using both the compositions and descriptors based on a knowledge of the properties of HEAs, outperforms that merely based on the compositions alone. This strategy offers a recipe to rapidly optimize multi-component systems, such as bulk metallic glasses and superalloys, towards desired properties. (C) 2019 Acta Materialia Inc.

TI Interfacial characteristics for active brazing of alumina to superalloys
SO JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB The brazing of alumina to Ni-base superalloy (Inconel 600) and Co-base superalloy (UMCo-50) has been studied. The Ag-Cu-Ti active filler metals with Ti-contents of 2 wt% and 8% wt% were employed in this study. However, experiments showed that the Ag-Cu-2 wt% Ti resulted in poor bonding, which was not suitable for the brazing. With an increase of the Ti-content to 8 wt%, whey could be bonded. However, the bonding strengths were still too low. The four-point bending strengths in this case were only 43-54 MPa. An improvement of the bending strength was achieved by inserting a Kovar interlayer. In this case, the bending strength was dramatically increased to 240 MPa and 226 MPa for alumina/UMCo-50 joint and alumina/Inconel 600 joint, respectively.

AB The investigation of microstructure and chemical composition of the gamma and gamma' phases were performed in a Ni-base superalloy by means of analytical electron microscopy. The distribution of particular elements in the alloy was revealed using X-ray mapping in a transmission electron microscope. The detected concentration profiles of alloying elements at the gamma'/gamma interface were relatively sharp in the case of cuboidal shape of the gamma' phase while they resembled the classical diffusion profile for the oval gamma' phase. The quantitative analysis of the gamma' phase revealed much higher content of Al and lower of Ti, W, Co and Mo in the oval precipitates compared to cuboidal ones. This result is attributed to the different solidification paths, which is eutectic for the cuboidal gamma' precipitates and peritectic for the oval gamma' precipitates.

TI Degradation behaviour of sputtered Co-Al coatings on superalloy
SO MATERIALS CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
AB Degradation behaviour of sputtered Co-Al coatings on Superni-718 substrate has been investigated. Cyclic high temperature oxidation tests were conducted on uncoated and coated samples at peak temperatures of 900 degrees C for up to 100 thermal cycles between the peak and room temperatures. The results showed that a dense scale formed on the coated samples during thermal cycling at the peak temperature of 900 degrees C. The external scale exhibited good spallation resistance during cyclic oxidation testing at both temperatures. The improvement in oxide scale spallation resistance is believed to be related to the fine-grained structure of the coating. Nanostructured Co-Al coatings on Superni-718 substrate were deposited by DC/RF magnetron sputtering. FE-SEM/EDS, AFM, and XRD were used to characterize the morphology and formation of different phases in the coatings, respectively. The Co-Al coating on superalloy substrate showed better performance of cyclic high temperature oxidation resistance due to its possession of beta-CoAl phase as Al reservoir and the formation of Al2O3 and spinel phases such as CoCr2O4 and CoAl2O4 in scale. The oxidation results confirmed an improved oxidation resistance of the Co-Al coating on superalloy as compare to bare substrate in air at 900 degrees C temperature up to 100 cycles.

CL Seven Springs, PA
SP TMS
AB To understand the effects of alloying elements on the creep rate of Ni-base superalloys, factors entering into a secondary creep rate are calculated via first-principles calculations based on density functional theory for 26 Ni31X systems where X = Al, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hf, Ir, Mn, Mo, Nb, Os, Pd, Pt, Re, Rh, Ru, Sc, Si, Ta, Tc, Ti, V, W, Y, Zr, and Zn. They are volume, elastic properties, stacking fault energy, and diffusivity. It is found that shear modulus, Young's modulus, and roughly stacking fault energy show inverse correlation to the atomic volume of the system. In addition, the closer the alloying elements to Ni, with respect to atomic volume and atomic number, the larger the predicted shear modulus, Young's modulus, and stacking fault energy. Diffusivity calculations show that mid-row 5d transition metal elements, particularly Re, Os, and Ir, have the highest activation barrier for diffusion, while far-right or far-left row placement elements such as Y, Zn, and Hf, have the lowest activation energy barriers for diffusion. A creep rate ratio of (epsilon) over dot(Ni31)x/(epsilon) over dot(Ni) is calculated and the effect of the alloying elements shows 13 systems have a decreased creep rate relative to Ni, while 13 systems have an increased creep rate relative to Ni.

TI Site preferences of alloying transition metal elements in Ni-based
   superalloy: A first-principles study
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB Atomistic characterization of chemical element distribution is crucial to understanding the role of alloying elements for strengthening mechanism of superalloy. In the present work, the site preferences of two alloying elements X-Y in gamma-Ni of Ni-based superalloy are systematically studied using first-principles calculations with and without spin-polarization. The doping elements X and Y are chosen from the 27 kinds of 3d, 4d, 5d group transition metals (Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Cu, Zn, Y, Zr, Nb, Mo, Tc, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, Cd, Hf, Ta, W, Re, Os, Ir, Pt, Au) and Al. We find that the spin-polarized calculations for Re-Re, Re-Ru, Re-Cr, Ru-Cr show a strong chemical binding affinity between the solute elements and are more consistent with the experimental results. The binding energies of pairs between the 28 elements have an obvious periodicity and are closely related the electronic configuration of the elements. When the d-electrons of the element are close to the half full-shell state, two alloying elements possess attractive binding energies, reflecting the effect of the Hund's rule. The combinations of early transition metals (Sc, Ti, V, Y, Zr, Nb, Hf, Ta) have a repulsive interaction in gamma-Ni. These results offer insights into the role of alloying elements for strengthening mechanism of superalloy.

TI Alumina formation and microstructural changes of aluminized CoNiCrAlY
   coating during high temperature exposure in the temperature range 925
   degrees C-1075 degrees C
SO MATERIALS AT HIGH TEMPERATURES
AB MCrAlY (M = Ni, Co) coatings are commonly used on gas-turbine components as oxidation resistant overlay coatings and bondcoats for thermal barrier systems. In the present work the microstructural features and oxidation behavior of an aluminized Co-base MCrAlY-coating on a Ni-based superalloy have been investigated in the temperature range 925-1075 degrees C. Microstructural studies of the oxidized coatings by SEM/EBSD were complemented with numerical thermodynamic calculations using the software package ThermoCalc. In the as-received condition the outer part of the coating consisted mostly of beta-(Ni,Co)Al. Formation of sigma-CoCr was observed at the interface between the beta-layer and the inner initial CoNiCrAlY. During high-temperature air exposure alumina based surface scales were formed but the oxidation induced Al depletion of the aluminized coating did not result in formation of the gamma'-(Ni3Al) phase. Rather, the subscale formation of Co/Cr-rich phases was observed and a direct transformation of beta- into gamma-Ni phase after longer times. It is expected that these subscale microstructural changes thus affect the alumina formation and growth as well as the critical aluminum depletion in a different manner as in the case of corresponding beta-NiAl coatings, although a direct comparison between various coating systems was not possible on the basis of the present results.

TI Densification and microstructural evolution during co-sintering of
   Ni-base superalloy powders
SO METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND
   MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB This work presents the effect of co-sintering on the densification and microstructural evolution in the two-layer stepwise graded composite of INCONEL 718 and INCONEL 625 superalloys. A pressureless co-sintering method in conjunction with a powder layering technique was used. The sintering was carried out in solid state and liquid phase in temperature ranging from 1260 degrees C through 1300 degrees C for 60 minutes in a low pressure of an argon atmosphere. Nonisothermal sintering behavior was also examined by dilatometric analysis. Similarly, the sintering response of the individual layers was characterized. The results reveal an enhanced densification rate during co-sintering of the composite layers. Sintering at low temperatures (T < 1270 degrees C) led to formation of a narrow dense region at the interface while the sintered layers were porous. In contrast, sintering at higher temperatures resulted in significant densification of the layers, although formation of a pore band at the interface was realized. It is suggested that the strain rate incompatibility between the layers during sintering induces mismatch stresses at the interface region. The resulting strain energy influences the densification of the boundary region by exerting a pressure on the sintering neck and affecting the material flow during liquid phase sintering. The induced densification of the bilayer configuration was experimentally measured and was shown to be in good agreement with the strain rate incompatibility.

TI Thermodynamic re-assessment of the Al-Co-W system
SO CALPHAD-COMPUTER COUPLING OF PHASE DIAGRAMS AND THERMOCHEMISTRY
AB The Al-Co-W system and its binary sub-systems Al-Co, Al-W and Co-W were critically reviewed. The thermodynamic description of the Al-Co-W system including all three binaries was developed considering thermodynamic and constitutional data of the systems. Results from density functional theory calculations were employed to improve reliability of the descriptions. The Gibbs energy for the thermal vacancy (G(va)) in the BCC_A2 phase is discussed. The revised descriptions obtained for the Al-W and Co-W systems describe the thermodynamic and phase equilibrium data well and are free of undesired artefacts for temperatures below 6000 K. The ordered gamma' phase of the Al-Co-W system is described as a metastable phase in the entire temperature range. The calculated Gibbs energy of the gamma' is only slightly above that of the equilibrium state, which indicates that there is good possibility of stabilizing the gamma' phase with the addition of gamma'-stabilizing elements, such as Ti, Ta, Hf, Nb and Ni.

TI The effect of phosphorus on the formation of grain boundary laves phase
   in high-refractory content Ni-based superalloys
SO SCRIPTA MATERIALIA
AB The effect of phosphorous on the microstructure of a powder-processed, high Nb-content, Ni-based superalloy was studied and compared to a P-free variant. The P-doped sample had a lower incipient melting temperature, forming a (Ni, Co, Cr, P)(2)(Nb, Mo) laves phase along the grain boundaries. Transmission electron microscopy and atom probe tomography were used to identify the crystal structure, assess phase compositions, and determine any elemental segregation to phase boundaries. The results revealed strong partitioning of P to the laves phase and a slight Mo gradient towards the phrase. Finally, a simplified laves phase was successfully modeled via density functional theory calculations. (C) 2018 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI THERMAL-STABILITY OF A PLATINUM ALUMINIDE COATING ON NICKEL-BASED
   SUPERALLOYS
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB An investigation was carried out to determine the thermal stability of a platinum aluminide coating on the directionally solidified alloy MAR M 002 and its single-crystal version alloy, SR R 99, at 800, 1 000 and 1100-degrees-C. The morphology, structure and microchemical composition of the coating were characterized using scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. In the as-deposited condition, the coating was found to consist of two layers. Most of the platinum was concentrated in the outer coating layer which consisted of a fine dispersion of PtAl2 in a matrix of beta-(Ni, Pt)Al containing other elements in solid solution, such as cobalt and chromium. The inner coating layer was relatively free of platinum and consisted essentially of beta-NiAl. Exposure at 800-degrees-C was found to have no significant effect on the structure and composition of the coating on each alloy. At temperatures greater-than-or-equal-to 1000-degrees-C, however, PtAl2 became thermodynamically unstable and significant interdiffusion occurred between the coating and alloy substrate. After exposure at 1000-degrees-C, the components of the outer coating layer were NiAl and Ni3Al. However, after exposure at 1100-degrees-C, the outer coating layer consisted only of Ni3Al. Also, after exposure at both temperatures, the composition of the outer coating layer approached that of the inner layer due to interdiffusion. Although the coating on both alloys exhibited similar structural stability at all temperatures investigated, the coating on alloy MAR M 002 was found to develop a more protective scale. This behaviour was correlated with differences in alloy substrate composition particularly rare-earth elements such as hafnium.

TI High-speed intermittent turning of GH2132 alloy with Si3N4/(W, Ti)C/Co
   graded ceramic tool
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY
AB In this paper, a new Si3N4-based graded ceramic tool was prepared by hot press technology The tool was toughened by microscale (W, Ti)C, nanoscale Si3N4, and metal Co. The graded structure combing with proper composition distribution introduced thermal residual compressive stress into the surface layer of the tool according to the FEM analysis. The performance of the tool in high-speed intermittent turning GH2132 alloy (equivalent to A286) was studied in contrast to one homogeneous tool. The cutting forces analysis indicates that the inserts endure periodic mechanical shock in the intermittent cutting process and the mechanical shock is more serious when the tooth engages the workpiece than when it disengages the workpiece. The tool failure modes observation shows ladder-like fracture under thermal and mechanical shock in the intermittent cutting process. Tool failure mechanisms involve chipping, flaking, microcracks, and adhesion. The graded tool shows better thermal and mechanical shock resistance than the homogeneous tool due to the formation of residual compressive stress.

AB Evolution of oxidation scale for a Ni-22Cr-20Co-18W alloy at 1100 degrees C was investigated by means of XRD and SEM (EDS). The results show that at the initial stage of the oxidation, a oxide scale of the mixture of Cr2O3, NiO and (Ni, Co, Mn, Cr)(3)O-4, which is of M3O4 type, is formed on the surface. The single-layer oxide film changes into double layer one after long time oxidation, the sequential Cr2O3 scale forms at the inner layer, and the outer NiO scale could effectively retard the volatilization of the inner Cr2O3 scale; the voids are formed at the scale/alloy interface and inner oxidation of Al element is observed at the same time.

AB A comparative study was carried out to evaluate the hot corrosion resistance of NiCrBSi and Stellite-6 coated nickel-based superalloy Superni 600 (15.5Cr-lOFe-0.5Mn-0.2C-balance Ni) in the molten salt environment of Na2SO4-60%V2O5 salt mixture at 900 degrees C under cyclic conditions. Hot corrosion experiments were performed for 50 cycles, each cycle consisting of I h heating in the laboratory tube furnace followed by 20 min cooling in the open air. The thermogravimetric technique was used to establish the kinetics of corrosion. The morphology, phase composition and element concentration of the corrosion products were detected using the combined techniques of X-ray diffractometry (XRD), scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive analysis (SEMIEDAX) and electron probe micro analyzer (EPMA). The hot corrosion resistance of NiCrBSi coating has been found to be better than that of Stellite-6 coating. The hot corrosion resistance of both the coatings has been attributed to the formation of oxides of chromium, silicon and nickel along with spinels of nickel-chromium and cobalt-chromium. These oxides seal/plug the pores and splat boundaries, and act as diffusion barriers to the inward diffusion of corroding species. (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Aluminum diffusion coatings enriched with silicon were prepared by chemical vapor deposition on various nickel-based materials such as almost pure nickel and Rene 80. Aluminum and silicon chloride served as precursors. They were generated in-situ by feeding gaseous hydrogen chloride (HCl) into a heated reaction chamber (1100 degrees C) which contained aluminum and silicon donating material. An excess of hydrogen gas flow was found to improve the coating growth Fate. Due to the high reactivity of aluminum, high ratios of silicon to aluminum donator had to be maintained (at least 10: 1). The coating thickness was determined from glow discharge spectroscopy and metallographic cross sections. Co-deposition and two-step deposition (first aluminizing and then siliconizing) were performed. Silicon contents of up to 50 at.% could be achieved. In contrast, a two-step process including first aluminizing and then siliconizing leads to an undesired replacement of aluminide by silicide. Al-Si diffusion coatings could be realized on internal cooling channels of turbine airfoils by single-step co-deposition. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Structural stability and mechanical properties of Co-3 (Al, M) (M = Ti,

SO COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB The structural stability and mechanical properties of Co-3 (Al, M) (M = Ti, V, Cr, Zr, Nb, Mo, Hf, Ta, W) compounds with cubic L-12 -type and hexagonal D0(19)-type structures have been investigated by first-principles calculations. Calculated temperature-dependent formation energies indicate that all the L-12-type Co-3 (Al, M) can be generated at high temperature and show better stability than their D0(19)-type according to the quasi-harmonic Debye model. Furthermore, we reveal that the element Al plays a major role in promoting L-12 structure more stable than D0(19) structure for the Co-3 (Al, W), and the element W reduces metastability as well as improves the strength of L-12. We also find that most of the L-12-Co-3 (Al, M) compounds possess good mechanical stability and ductility, which are verified by the elastic constants and Poisson's ratio. More importantly, the element Cr can be used to replace the W of L-12-Co-3 (Al, W) to increase the strength to weight ratio as the L-12-Co-3 (Al, Cr) possesses comparable elastic properties to the L-12-Co-3 (Al, W), including the Young's and shear moduli. It is also observed that all the L-12-Co-3 (Al, M) compounds show a high degree of elastic anisotropy. The electron localized function and suggests that the rise of the Young's moduli in Co-3 (Al, M), with the alloying element M changing from group IVB to VIB, is mainly attributed by the increasing bonding strength of the nearby transition-metal atoms. Our results will be useful for the study of thermodynamic and mechanical properties as well as the design of Co-based high-temperature alloys. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Accounting for lattice coherency in a two-phase elastic-plastic
   self-consistent model for nickel-based superalloys
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLASTICITY
AB A 2-site elastic-plastic self-consistent (EPSC) model is developed and implemented in order to account for crystallographic texture development and grain morphology evolution under strong correlations between neighbor grains of different phases, both in space and orientation. Predictions of the model adequately fit the published in situ neutron diffraction data for nickel-based superalloys at ambient and elevated temperatures, in which gamma and gamma' phases exhibit exact cube-cube orientation relationship. Comparison with 2-site model (small strain algorithm, nonrotation scheme) and 1-site model (finite strain algorithm, co-rotation scheme) has been made, and the result shows that the present 2-site model (finite strain algorithm, rotation scheme) leads to better predictions in lattice strain evolution where both rotation of crystal lattice and correlation between inclusions are accounted for, especially when the applied strain is larger than 0.02 for transverse direction and 0.05 similar to 0.18 for axial direction for the materials studied in this work. Based on a systematic study on the effects of grain-grain interaction and total grain number on the homogenized results, we found that transverse lattice strains of gamma (200) and/or gamma' (100) are sensitive to the interplay between gamma-gamma' interaction and evolution of grain orientation distribution with deformation, while that of gamma (220) and gamma' (110) are sensitive to the initial crystallographic texture.

AB A series of AL(x)Co(1.5)CrFeNi(1.5)Ti(y) high-entropy alloys with different Al and Ti contents were designed, and their phase and microstructure were investigated. The adhesive wear behavior and mechanism were also studied and compared with the conventional wear-resistant steels SUJ2 and SKH51. The amounts of Al and Ti strongly affect the phase and microstructure, particularly the amount and morphology of the hard eta-(Ni, Co)(3)Ti phase. It was found that the wear resistance of the Co1.5CrFeNi1.5Ti and Al0.2Co1.5CrFeNi1.5Ti alloys is at least two times better than that of conventional wear-resistant steels with similar hardness. The excellent anti-oxidation property and resistance to thermal softening in these high-entropy alloys are proposed to be the main reasons for the outstanding wear resistance.

TI ALLOY DESIGN AND MICROSTRUCTURE OF A BIOMEDICAL CO-CR ALLOY
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Two wrought Co-Cr alloys for dental and surgical implant and equipment applications were designed and their microstructures and hot workability determined and compared to a current dental alloy SC--H. The chemical composition of the alloys was selected with regard to the general requirements for biomedical alloys and the general principles of alloying theory. A phase-control law originally developed for nickel-base superalloys, PHACOMP, was utilized in order to avoid the formation of topologically close-packed (t c p) phases and to ensure the ductility and workability of the alloy. The alloys were cast using a vacuum induction melting technique which was found to allow a fairly good chemical composition control of the alloys. Hot forging of the as-cast alloys confirmed their good workability. Optical metallography showed the as-cast alloys to have a dendritic structure with some spherical carbide particles in the interdendrite regions. In contrast, the dental alloy SC-H in the as-cast condition had continuous carbide along the grain boundaries which impaired the ductility and prevented hot forging of this alloy due to cracking of the specimens. X-ray diffraction analysis showed that both alloys I and II have the fcc-Co matrix and Cr23C6 type carbide particles. No tcp phases were observed.

TI WROUGHT COBALT-BASE SUPERALLOYS
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING AND PERFORMANCE
CT 7TH INTERNATIONAL SYMP ON SUPERALLOYS
CY SEP 20-24, 1992
CL CHAMPION, PA
AB Wrought cobalt-base superalloys are used extensively in gas turbine engines because of their excellent high-temperature creep and fatigue strengths and resistance to hot corrosion attack. In addition, the unique character of the oxide scales that form on some of the alloys provides outstanding resistance to high-temperature sliding wear. This article provides a review of the evolutionary development of wrought cobalt-base alloys in terms of alloy design and physical metallurgy. The topics include solid-solution strengthening, carbide precipitation characteristics, and attempts to introduce age hardening. The use of PHACOMP to enhance thermal stability characteristics and,the incorporation of rare-earth elements to improve oxidation resistance is also reviewed and discussed. The further development of cobalt-base superalloys has been severely hampered by past political events, which have accentuated the strategic vulnerability of cobalt as a base or as an alloying element. Consequently, alternative alloys have been developed that use little or no cobalt. One such alternative, Haynes(R) 230(TM) alloy, is discussed briefly.

TI Multicomponent gamma'-strengthened Co-based superalloys with increased
   solvus temperatures and reduced mass densities
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB Several Co-Al-(W)-based gamma-(FCC)/gamma'-(L1(2)) alloys are investigated to combine recent results indicating significant increases in the gamma'-solvus temperature with additions of Ni, Ta, and Ti, and reduced mass density with the substitution of Mo and Nb for W. A maximum solvus temperature of 1167 +/- 6 degrees C is achieved for an alloy with the composition Co-30Ni-7Al-4Ti-7W-1Ta (mole fraction x 100); while the composition Co-30Ni-7Al-4Ti-3Mo-2W-1Nb-1Ta (L19) exhibits a promising combination of high gamma' volume fraction and solvus temperature, low mass density, and excellent two-phase gamma-gamma'microstructural stability. Atom probe tomographic measurement of L19 aged for 4 hat 900 degrees C indicates that Ni, Al, Ti, W, Nb, and Ta partition preferentially to the gamma'-precipitates while Co partitions strongly to the gamma-matrix. Molybdenum segregates at the gamma/gamma' interface, resulting in a reduction in the interfacial free energy of 1.63 +/- 0.85 mJ m(-2). Decreasing the mole fraction of Ni from 30% to 10% decreases the partitioning of Al and Ti to the gamma'-phase and increases partitioning of Co, Mo, W, Nb, and Ta to the gamma'-phase. From an analysis of coarsening kinetics (Ostwald ripening) at 900 C in Co-xNi-7Al-4Ti-3Mo-2W-1Nb-1Ta (x = 10 and 30) interfacial free energies of 35.0 +/- 18.6 mJ m(-2) and 29.2 +/- 15.5 mJ m(-2) are calculated for mole fractions of Ni of 10% and 30%, respectively. This decrease in interfacial free energy with increasing Ni-concentration is attributed partially to both Mo-segregation at the gamma-gamma' interface and a decrease in the lattice parameter misfit between the gamma'-precipitate and gamma-matrix, and concomitantly the misfit strain energy.

TI Corrosion behavior of welded Ni-Co-Cr-Si alloys during exposure in
   integrated coal gasification combined cycle syngas plants
SO MATERIALS TESTING
AB The corrosion behavior of commercially available and welded Haynes (R) 160 (R) Ni-Co-Cr-Si alloy samples was investigated by exposure to coal-gasifying integrated coal gasification combined cycle pilot plant facilities under typical conditions as 2.005 MPa and 160 to 300 degrees C. The morphological and microstructural analyses of the exposed samples were conducted using scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis on the external surface of the recovered corrosion test samples to obtain information of the corrosion scale. These analyses based on the pre- and post-exposure corrosion test samples combined with thermodynamic Ellingham-Pourbaix stability diagrams provided preliminary insight into the mechanism of the observed corrosion behavior prevailing in the piping materials that connected the particulate removal unit and the water scrubber of the integrated coal gasification combined cycle pilot plant. Uniform material wastage was observed after 46 hours of operation, and a preliminary corrosion mechanism was suggested: the observed material waste and corrosion behavior of the Haynes (R) 160 (R) Ni-Co-Cr-Si alloy samples cut off from the coal syngas integrated coal gasification combined cycle plant were explained by the formation of discontinuous (complex) oxide phases and subsequent chlorine-induced active oxidation under the predominantly reducing environment encountered. This contribution supplements the already published studies of Haynes (R) 556 (R) Fe-Ni-Cr-Co alloys and Haynes (R) 230 (R) nickel-based superalloys and completes the comprehensive series of such coal-gasifying integrated coal gasification combined cycle pilot plant exposure tests using the facilities affiliated with the Institute for Advanced Engineering.

TI Yield anomaly in L1(2) Co3AlxW1-x vis-a-vis Ni3Al
SO SCRIPTA MATERIALIA
AB First principles calculations were performed in Co3AlxW1-x to estimate fault energies, elastic constants and parameters determining the thermodynamic viability and kinetics of yield anomaly. These parameters predict the occurrence of yield anomaly, but only for a limited range of compositions. The driving force for cross-slip resulting in sessile dislocation configurations and cube slip is lower in Co3AlxW1-x than Ni3Al due to the less-pronounced anisotropy between antiphase boundary energies on the cube and octahedral planes. Yield anomaly is expected at higher temperatures in Co3AlxW1-x because of the higher activation energy resulting from the higher shear modulus. (C) 2016 Acta Materialia Inc.

TI Comparison of O adsorption on Ni3Al (001), (011), and (111) surfaces
   through first-principles calculations
SO PHYSICA B-CONDENSED MATTER
AB First-principles calculations were performed to study the properties of O adsorption on Ni3Al (0 0 1), (0 1 1), and (1 1 1) surfaces using the Cambridge serial total package (CASTEP) code. Stable adsorption sites are identified. The atomic and electronic structures and adsorption energies are predicted. The adsorption sites for O on the Ni3Al (0 0 1) surface are at the 2Ni-2Al fourfold hollow site, whereas O prefers to adsorb at the Ni-Al bridge site on (0 1 1) surface and 2Ni-Al threefold hollow site on (1 1 1) surface. It is found that O shows the strongest affinity for Al and the state of O is the most stabilized when O adsorbs on (0 0 1) surface, while the affinity of O for Al on (0 1 1) surface is weaker than (0 0 1) surface, and (1 1 1) surface is the weakest. The stronger O and Al affinity indicates more stable Al2O3 when oxidized. The experiment has shown that the oxidation resistance of single crystal superalloy in different orientations improves in the order of (1 11), (0 1 1), and (0 0 1) surface, suggesting that the oxidation in different crystallographic orientations may be related to the affinity of O for Al in the surface.

TI A Newly Developed Wrought Ni-Fe-Cr-based Superalloy for Advanced
   Ultra-Supercritical Power Plant Applications Beyond 700 degrees C
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA-ENGLISH LETTERS
AB Some existing wrought Ni-Cr-Co-based superalloys are being evaluated as the candidate materials for advanced ultra-supercritical power plant applications beyond 700 degrees C due to their high creep strength. But they are all prohibitively expensive due to the addition of Co, Mo and W. Here we developed a new Ni-Fe-Cr-based superalloy (named as HT700 alloy) with low cost and high strength. This paper reports the mechanical properties and fracture modes of HT700 alloy to support its high temperature applications and to understand prospective failure mechanism. Fracto-graphic examinations indicate that the fracture modes shift with test condition change. In addition, the HT700 alloy has relatively stable microstructure at 750 degrees C. Compared with IN740 and GH2984 alloys, this new alloy has higher yield strength in the temperature range from room temperature to 800 degrees C. The creep life of this new alloy is much longer than that of the Ni-Fe-based superalloy GH2984. The results suggest that this new alloy is a promising material for advanced ultra-supercritical power plant applications beyond 700 degrees C.

TI Measurement of the density of binary Ni-X (X=Co, W, Ta, Al) alloys
SO MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS
CT 10th World Titanium Conference
CY JUL, 2003
CL Hamburg, GERMANY
AB The modified sessile drop method (MSDM) and modified pycnometric method (MPM) have been employed to measure the densities of liquid Ni-Co, Ni-W, Ni-Ta and Ni-Al alloys precisely. In the case of Ni-Al alloys measurements were also made in the "mushy" state where both solid and liquid coexist. There was a good agreement between the values measured by the two methods. The density of liquid Ni-base binary alloys from the melting points to 1833 K and that of Ni-Al alloys in the mushy state decrease linearly with increasing temperature. The temperature coefficient of the density of Ni-base binary alloys measured in this work was regressed as a quadratic function of the concentration of alloy element. The measured density of Ni-base binary alloys at any required temperature can also be expressed as a quadratic function of the concentration of alloy element. The recommended equations for the density of Ni-base binary alloys were obtained as a function of composition and temperature by regressing the density values measured by both MSDM and MPM. The calculated values from the recommended density equations show good agreement with those obtained with both methods.

TI Effects of alloying elements on relative phase stability and elastic
   properties of L1(2) Co3V from first-principles calculations
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Nineteen transition metal elements have been taken into account to study the alloying effects on the relative phase stability, elastic properties and electronic structure of L1(2) Co3V compound, based on the first-principles calculations. The site preference of ternary alloying elements was primarily determined with the help of normalized transfer energy. According to the results, four groups of alloying elements were classified, namely strong/weak V site preference and strong/weak Co site preference. In view of relative phase stability, we found that the Co-V-Hf, Co-V-Ir and Co-V-Pt systems have strong potential to precipitate the stable gamma' phase, other than Co-V-Ti, Co-V-Ta systems that have been experimentally reported. The stabilizing effect of ternary alloying elements on gamma' phase has an order of Ti > Ta > Hf > Ir > Pt > Nb > Zr > Rh > Sc > W. By using stress-strain method, the elastic properties including bulk modulus, shear modulus and Young's modulus were evaluated. Significantly, the intrinsic linear relationship between elastic properties and electron density per molar volume was revealed. It is found that the shear moduli G ({110}) and G ({111}) of L1(2) Co3V compound are increased by alloying Cr, Tc, Re and Pt elements, while reduced by other transition metal elements. To understand the mechanism, we employed the charge density difference to characterize the electronic structure of some typical X-substituted L1(2) Co3V compounds. The results successfully associate the shear moduli of these compounds with the anisotropic distribution of transfer electron density.

TI Co-deposition of aluminide and silicide coatings on gamma-TiAl by pack
   cementation process
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Thermochemical analyses were carried out for a series of pack powder mixtures for deposition of aluminide and for co-deposition of aluminide and silicide coatings on gamma-TiAl by the pack cementation process. Based on the results obtained, experimental studies were undertaken to identify optimum pack powder mixtures for depositing adherent and coherent aluminide and silicide coatings. Pack powder mixtures activated by 2 wt% AlCl3 was used to aluminise gamma-TiAl at 1000degreesC. With proper control of pack compositions and coating conditions, an aluminide coating of TiAl3 with a coherent structure free from microcracking was deposited on the substrate surface via inward diffusion of aluminium. The results of thermochemical calculations indicated that co-deposition of Al and Si is possible with CrCl3.6H(2)O and AlCl3 activated pack powders containing elemental Al and Si as depositing sources. Experimental results obtained at 1100degreesC revealed that CrCl3.6H(2)O is not suitable for use as an activator for co-depositing aluminide and silicide coatings on gamma-TiAl. It caused a significant degree of degradation instead of coating deposition to the substrate. However, adherent coatings with excellent structural integrity consisting of an outer TiSi4 layer and an inner TiAl3 layer were successfully co-deposited at 1100degreesC and 1000degreesC using pack powder mixtures activated by AlCl3. It is suggested that such coatings were formed via a sequential deposition mechanism through inward diffusion of aluminium and silicon. Discussion is presented on the issues that need to be considered to ensure the deposition of aluminide and silicide coatings with coherent structure free from microcracking on gamma-TiAl by the pack cementation process.

TI Effects of alloying elements and temperature on the elastic properties
   of dilute Ni-base superalloys from first-principles calculations
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB The variation of elastic properties, e. g., elastic constants, bulk modulus, and shear modulus of dilute Ni-base superalloys due to alloying elements (X's) and temperature, has been studied via first-principles calculations. Here, 26 alloying elements are considered: Al, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hf, Ir, Mn, Mo, Nb, Os, Pd, Pt, Re, Rh, Ru, Sc, Si, Ta, Tc, Ti, V, W, Y, Zn, and Zr. It is found that (i) both the bulk and shear moduli of Ni-X decrease approximately linearly with increasing equilibrium volume, especially within each group of 3d, 4d, or 5d transition-metal alloying elements; (ii) all alloying elements considered herein increase the ratio of bulk to shear modulus (i. e., the ductility) and the elastic anisotropy of the Ni-X alloys; and (iii) the largest decrease of elastic properties of Ni is caused by alloying element Y. It is observed that the change of elastic properties of Ni due to various alloying elements is traceable from the distribution of (magnetization) charge density, for instance the spherical distribution of charge density facilitates shear deformation, resulting in a lower shear-related property. Using a proposed quasistatic approach based on the predicted elasticity-volume-temperature relationship, the isothermal and the isentropic elastic properties are predicted for the dilute Ni-X alloys at finite temperatures, displaying a decreasing trend with respect to temperature for each Ni-X system. Computed elastic properties are in favorable accord with available experimental data. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics. [http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4749406]

TI Cyclic-loading microstructure-property relations from a mesoscale
   perspective: An example of single crystal Nickel-based superalloys
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Past models of stress-strain response under cyclic loading mainly rely on macroscopic equations which consider microstructure evolution indirectly or simply discard microstructure information. Modern materials science, on the other hand, seeks quantitative descriptions for the relations between microstructure and loading response. In the present work, we show a promising mesoscale phase-field framework which can describe co-evolution of phase/grain and defect microstructures, reveal microstructure mechanisms and simultaneously predict deformation properties as a natural outcome of microstrucuture interactions. The energy functionals for phase/grain and defect microstructures are constructed, followed by functional variation which leads to governing equations. Applying the developed framework to high temperature cyclic loading of single crystal Nickel-based superalloys, the simulated results show that cyclic loading-microstructure-property relations can be principally revealed. In the short term perspective (in one cycle), dislocations move back and forth, leading to cyclic loops consistent with characteristics observed in experiments. The plastic strains are one order of magnitude smaller than total strains, which explains why the cyclic loops are very "thin". In the long term perspective, all gamma/gamma' microstructures exhibit directional coarsening similar to creep under zero cyclic loading ratio, with the extent of rafting slightly dependents on cyclic waveform, period, etc. The plastic strains are sensitive to cyclic loading conditions both in terms of curve shape and in terms of magnitude.

TI On the diffusive phase transformation mechanism assisted by extended
   dislocations during creep of a single crystal CoNi-based superalloy
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB We propose here a deformation-induced diffusive phase transformation mechanism occurring during shearing of gamma' ordered phase in a gamma/gamma' single crystalline CoNi-based superalloy. Shearing involved the creation and motion of a high density of planar imperfections. Through correlative electron microscopy and atom probe tomography, we captured a superlattice intrinsic stacking fault (SISF) and its associated moving leading partial dislocation (LPD). The structure and composition of these imperfections reveal characteristic chemical structural contrast. The SISF locally exhibits a D0(19) ordered structure coherently embedded in the L-12 gamma' and enriched in W and Co. Interestingly, the LPD is enriched with Cr and Co, while the adjoining planes ahead of the LPD are enriched with Al. Quantitative analysis of the three-dimensional compositional field in the vicinity of imperfections sheds light onto a new in-plane diffusion mechanism as the LPD moves on specific {111)}evier planes upon application of stress at high temperature.

AB Co-Al-W alloys strengthened with the L1(2) gamma-prime phase have promise as next generation high temperature materials due to the ability to engineer a high gamma-prime content alloy with a higher gammaprime solvus and higher melting point than many Ni-base gamma-prime strengthened alloys. Furthermore, these Co-Al-W gamma-prime alloys are interesting as potential cast-and-wrought alloys because they have a relatively narrow range of solidification temperature and large range of temperature between the gamma-prime solvus and the solidus, suggesting than manufacturing via an ingot metallurgy route would be feasible. However, since J. Sato et al discovered gamma-prime in the Co-Al-W alloy system in 2006, the focus in the literature has been on characterizing the structure and properties of these alloys and measuring and assessing the thermodynamics of the alloy system primarily for application as castings for turbine blade applications. To date the author is not aware of any publications describing the microstructure of vacuum induction melted, vacuum arc remelted ingots of a size more than about 2kg. Most work has been performed using small, laboratory-scale, cast-and-hot-rolled samples or samples cast as single crystals. This paper presents ATI's experience in assessing the feasibility of manufacturing a cast-and-wrought billet product in the Co-Al-W-X alloy system. Three 22 kg heats were produced to examine a small range of alloy compositions of potential commercial interest: Co-9Al-9W, Co-9Al-10W-2Ti, and Co-9Al-10W- 2Ti-0.02B, respectively. Each heat was vacuum-induction-melted and vacuum-arc-remelted then open-die forged. The ingot microstructure has been characterized. Hot workability during billetizing will be described and microstructure and hardness of hot worked and heat treated product will be presented.

TI Friction and wear characterization of some cobalt- and iron-based
   superalloys in zinc alloy baths
SO WEAR
AB A full-journal submerged bearing test rig was built to evaluate the friction and wear behavior of materials in zinc alloy baths. Some cobalt- and iron-based superalloys were tested using this rig at conditions similar to those of a continuous galvanizing operation (load and bath chemistry). Metallographic and chemical analyses were conducted on tested samples to characterize the wear. It was found that a commonly used cobalt-based material (Stellite #6) not only suffered considerable wear but also reacted with zinc baths to form intermetallic compounds. Other cobalt- and iron-based superalloys appeared to have negligible reaction with the zinc baths in the short-term tests, but cracks developed in the sub-surface, suggesting that the materials mainly experienced surface fatigue wear. The commonly used cobalt-based superalloy mostly experienced abrasive wear. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Development of a nickel-base cast superalloy with high strength and
   superior creep properties
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Derived from Russian alloy CHS88U, six experimental Ni-base alloys named as A to F in the Ni-Cr-Co-W-Ti-AI-Hf system are designed, evaluated and processed. One of these alloys, F, shows excellent high temperature tensile strength and ductility with superior creep rupture properties. As predicted by using modeling tools such as PHACOM and NEW PHACOMP, there is hardly the tendency for formation of topologically close-packed phase (TCP) phase in alloy F. Furthermore, through microstructural observation, it is also found that no TCP phase is formed in alloy F after long-time exposure at high temperature. So alloy F has well balance of phase stability and mechanical properties in view of application for gas turbines. It is proved that d-electron approach can be applied for design and development of nickel-base superalloys for gas turbine application.

AB Ni-20 wt pct Cr wires, as individual wires or within 3D woven structures, are alloyed with Mo, Al, and Ti by gas-phase surface deposition and volume interdiffusion. Mo deposition creates Mo-rich coating and Kirkendall pores. Al + Ti co-deposition creates uniform triple-layered coating.

TI Chemical stripping methods for the removal of NiCrAlY thermal spray
   coatings
SO KOVOVE MATERIALY-METALLIC MATERIALS
AB The present paper is focused on the "stripping" of serviced blades and vanes for gas turbine, which need the removal of the coating in order to be repaired and refitted with a new coating. The stripping process requires, normally, the separate removal of the top coat (Yttria Partially Stabilized Zirconia, YPSZ) and of the bond coat (MCrAlY where M stays for Co, Ni or both). The present paper examines only chemical procedures able to remove the NiCrAlY bond coat. The blades and vanes surfaces after removal of NiCrAlY coatings were characterized from the point of view of surface morphology, metallurgical structure and chemical composition. The efficiency of the acid solution in NiCrAlY removal has been investigated and the behaviour of two Ni based alloys substrates in aggressive environment has been tested. The HCl based stripping solution shows good performances in Vacuum Plasma Sprayed NiCrAlY coatings removal from Ni superalloys. The tested stripping procedure is fast and safe because no damage to base materials has been noted.

TI Interdiffusion behavior of Ni-Cr-Al-Y coatings deposited by arc-ion
   plating
SO OXIDATION OF METALS
AB Ni-Cr-Al-P coatings were deposited on the Ni3Al-base superalloys IC-6 and K17 by are-ion plating. The results indicated that a small amount of substrate atoms, such as Co, Ti, Mo, etc., existed in the Ni-Cr-Al-Y coatings near the substrates, probably due to "sputter" and "antisputter." For the alloy K17, the impeding effect of Al was not obvious, because the temperatures of the substrate and the coating were high (420-480 degreesC) during the deposition process and interdiffusion was accelerated. However, for alloy IC-6 which contains Al, as well as a high concentration of Mo, the diffusion of Cr was impeded. Vacuum heat treatment at 1050 degreesC drastically increased diffusivities and the presence of Al and Mo was not enough to prevent some Cr diffusion. Thus, the coating became mor e uniform and close to the desired composition.

AB In this paper oxidation induced microstructural changes of a Co based bond coat alloy are discussed. Microstructure of Co32Ni21Cr(4-12)Al3ReY was studied at 1000 degrees C and modelled using thermo-calc. The effect of varying aluminum content on precipitating phases was quantified and experimental results were compared with modelled microstructure to access modelling capabilities of thermo-calc. Dictra was used to predict microstructural changes due to Al depletion and the influence of alloy's microstructure on material's properties was also considered. Microstructural changes across oxidized alloy were related to spatially varying alloy's hardness. Experimental findings proved thermodynamic modelling and kinetic simulations produced excellent qualitative and quantitative phase information to represent the system under oxidation at high temperature.

The following steps are dealt with by modelling and experiment: solidification of the blade alloy during casting, microstructural changes during homogenization and aging heat treatments, chemical vapour deposition of an Al(2)O(3) diffusion barrier coating, physical vapour deposition (sputtering) of a (Ni,Co)CrAlY bond coat, atmospheric plasma spraying of an Y(2)O(3) stabilized ZrO(2) thermal barrier coating and microstructural changes and development of critical stresses at in-service conditions.

TI Long-term oxidation behavior and mechanism of DD6 Ni-based single
   crystal superalloy at 1050 degrees C and 1100 degrees C in air
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB By virtue of XRD, OM, SEM and EDS, detailed oxidation behaviors for 2000h exposure of DD6 Ni-based single crystal superalloy ware investigated at 1050 degrees C and 1100 degrees C. The oxidation kinetic curves both follow the parabolic law in the first stage, during which time the oxidation behaviors in interdendritic area and dendrite core area are different. With the oxidation time continuing, the morphologies of the oxides in these two kinds of areas gradually tend to coincide: An outer columnar (Ni, Co)O, an intermediate layer mainly composed of NiTa2O6, CoCo2O4, CoWO4, NiCr2O4 and other complex compounds and spinel phases, an inner continuous layer of alpha-Al2O3. The double diffusion of oxygen anions and Ni and Co cations developed inwards and outwards respectively is responsible for the morphology of the oxide scale. At 1100 degrees C, the Al2O3 film formed in the initial time is unstable, discontinuous and incompact and the inner Al2O3 layer formed after 300 h oxidation is porous. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB The lattice parameters and the local lattice distortions around solute atoms in fcc-Ni solutions were studied using first-principles calculations. The solute atoms considered include Al, Co, Cr, Hf, Mo, Nb, Re, Ru, Ta, Ti, and W. The calculations were performed using supercells with 1 solute atom and 107 solvent atoms. It is found that the atomic size difference, the electronic interactions, and the magnetic spin relations between the solute and solvent atoms all contribute to the lattice distortions. Based on the results from first-principles calculations, the linear composition coefficients of fcc Ni lattice parameter for different solutes were determined, and the lattice parameters of multicomponent Ni-base superalloys as a function of solute composition were predicted. The results are compared with existing experimental measurements, and good agreements are obtained for both the compositional dependence of lattice parameters and the local lattice distortions.

AB The high temperature corrosion behavior of N07263, N06600, and N06625 in LiCl-Li2O molten salt was investigated at temperatures ranging from 650 to 850 A degrees C in a glove box. The high temperature corrosion behavior was observed using measurements of the oxide morphology and thickness, the extent of internal corrosion, and the compositional changes in the scale and in the substrate. Corrosion tests were performed, and these demonstrated that the main corrosion products were Fe(Ni,Co)(3), FeNi3, and LiCrO2. The internal corrosion of N07263 was localized, while that of N06600 maintained intergranular corrosion throughout the test temperature range. N06625 exhibited uniform intergranular corrosion behaviors at low and high temperatures. N07263 exhibited superior corrosion resistance, as evidenced by its corrosion layer which was more continuous, dense, and adherent when compared with those of N06600 and N06625.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMPACT ENGINEERING
AB The dynamic yield and fracture stress of two refractory alloys were measured under shock-wave loading at normal and elevated (up to 680 degreesC) temperatures. The tested materials were polycrystalline nickel-based superalloy Inconel IN738LC and PWA 1483 Ni-Co-Fe alloy in quasi-monocrystalline state. Both alloys are used as turbine blade materials for the hot first stages of gas turbines. The alloys exhibit nonmonotonous dependence of the dynamic yield strength upon temperature with an abrupt increase in the temperature interval of 550-600 degreesC. The dynamic tensile strength, in general, is less sensitive to temperature and shows less pronounced increase in the vicinity of 570 degreesC. The observed anomalies of the dynamic strength properties correlate with anomalies in the heat capacity which are associated with the equilibrating of the short-range order in the gamma-matrix of the alloys.

   stability in Ni-based single crystal superalloys
SO INTERMETALLICS
AB Precipitation of deleterious topologically close-packed (TCP) phases worsens the mechanical behavior of Ni-based single crystal superalloys. It is acknowledged that Ru will inhibit precipitation of TCP phase. In this paper, precipitation behaviors of TCP in alloy with and without Ru have been investigated through experimental characterization means, combined with the first principles calculations. For the first time, the interface structure between precipitated mu phase and matrix gamma phase has been established, and stable interfacial termination types in different orientation relationships were obtained. Effects of solute atoms like Ru on interface stability and site substitution behaviors of different solute elements in two phases were further calculated, and compared with precipitation behavior and composition information of TCP phases in two alloys. It is verified that Ru is different with other elements, which can remarkably increase the interfacial energy of mu/gamma interface, decrease interface stability, and rise the difficulty of nucleation of mu phase; conversely, W will lower the interfacial energy of mu/gamma, making it easier for mu phase to nucleate; the effects of Co and Cr are not that obvious; the effects of Re and Mo on interfacial energy and nucleation of mu phase vary with orientation relationships. Also, Re, Cr, and Ru have larger trends to diffuse from matrix gamma to mu phase during growing process of mu phase. The above reasons give rise to blocking effect of Ru on the nucleation of TCP phase, but Ru has trifling influence on inhibition of precipitation growth.

SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Alloy 909 is a Ni-Fe-Co alloy that exhibits a low coefficient of thermal expansion and high strength at elevated temperatures. These characteristics are suitable for demanding high temperature uses such as turbine components for aerospace and energy generation. The mechanical properties are achieved by heat treatment (solution and aging) that affects the microstructural characteristics such as grain size and precipitation of intergranular and transgranular particles. This work summarises the results of trials conducted to determine the conditions that assure the desired mechanical properties in high temperature ring rolled pieces. Results of tensile, hardness and stress rupture tests are complemented by microstructural analyses. These studies allowed for establishing a robust method for the manufacture of rings; no degradation of the product, either metallurgical or due to properties, has been reported after the method was implemented.

Among the different available optimization paths, the decrease of segregating element Cu, the increase of oxidation protective elements Al and Cr and the approach towards a gamma-gamma' microstructure like in Ni-based superalloys have been probed and compared. Microscopical observations have been made for every optimization step. Vickers microhardness measurements and/or tensile/compression test have been carried out when the alloy was appropriate. Five derived alloys AlCoCrFeNi, Al23Co15Cr23Cu8Fe15Ni16, Al8Co17Cr17Cu8Fe17Ni33, Al8Co17Cr14Cu8Fe17Ni34.8Mo0.1Ti1W0.1 and Al10Co25Cr8Fe15Ni36Ti6 (all at.%) have been compared to the original AlCoCrCuFeNi and the most promising one has been selected for further investigation.

TI Preparation and oxidation of an Al2O3-modified aluminide coating
SO VACUUM
AB An Al2O3-modified aluminide coating was produced by aluminizing an as-electrodeposited Ni-Al2O3 nanocomposite film using pack cementation method at 1100 C for 4 h. For comparison, aluminizing was also performed in the same condition on an as-deposited Ni film without Al2O3 nanoparticles. SEM/EDAX and TEM results indicated that the co-deposited Al2O3 nanoparticles were homogeneously dispersed in the finer-grain nanocrystalline Ni grains. The isothermal and cyclic oxidation in air at 900 degrees C indicated that the Al2O3-modified aluminide coatings were profoundly oxidation resistant as compared to the Al2O3-free aluminide coatings due to the faster formation of a continuous adherent alpha-Al2O3 scale. The effect of Al2O3 on the microstructure and the oxidation of the aluminide coating are discussed in the detail. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

CL MADISON, WI
AB The microstructural development in PWA-1480 superalloy electron beam welds (Ni-11.0at%Al-11.5%Cr-1.9%Ti-5.1%Co-4.0%Ta-1.3%W) was characterized. Optical microscopy revealed a branched dendritic structure in the weld metal. Transmission electron microscopy of these welds, in the as-welded condition, showed fine cuboidal (0.05-0.5 mu m) L1(2)-ordered gamma' precipitates within the gamma grains. The average volume percentage of the gamma' precipitates was found to be similar to 75%. Atom probe analyses revealed that the composition of the gamma matrix was Ni-4.6at%Al-25.5%Cr-0.4%Ti-9.4%Co-0.8%Ta-2.9%W and that of the gamma' precipitates was Ni-18.2at%Al-2.6%Cr-2.4%Ti-2.8%Co-7.1%Ta-1.5%W. These compositions were compared with the previous APFIM analyses of commercial PWA-1480 single crystals that had received conventional heat treatments. Small differences were found in the chromium and aluminum levels and these may be due to the nonequilibrium nature of phase transformations that occur during weld cooling. No solute segregation was detected at the gamma-gamma' interface. The APFIM results were also compared with the thermodynamic calculations of alloying element partitioning between the gamma and gamma' phases using the ThermoCalc(TM) program.

TI Phase structure, morphology evolution and protective behaviors of
   chemical vapor deposited (Ni, Pt)Al coatings
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB A chemical vapor deposited (CVD) aluminizing process had been employed to deposit platinum modified aluminide coatings on the nickel-based single-crystal superalloys. The kinetics behavior, phase evolution, microstructure and chemical composition of the (Ni, Pt)Al coatings after oxidation and hot corrosion tests were studied in detail. After isothermal oxidation test, a protective alpha-Al2O3 scale is formed on the coating surface and, two new phases of (Ni, Pt)(3)Al-4 and gamma'-(Ni, Pt)(3)Al due to phase transformation reactions occur in the aluminide layer. The inward diffusion of Al element toward the substrate and, formation of micro-pores in the interface of aluminide layer and interdiffusion zone are probably the main degradation modes of the coating. Corrosive medium including of mixed of aviation fuels and artificial seawater has not serious deterioration of the coating after hot corrosion and furthermore a network of grain boundary ridges is still co-existed on the coating surface, although large of micro-pores and some of grain boundaries are appeared within the aluminide layer.

   of Co-based superalloys
SO WEAR
CT 17th International Conference on Wear of Materials
CY APR 19-23, 2009
CL Las Vegas, NV
AB The goal of this work was to rank, as quantitatively as possible, the high-temperature scuffing characteristics of a series of Co-based materials, including coatings, for possible use in wear-critical components like those in diesel engine exhaust systems and emission-controls. A cylinder pivoting on its side against a flat tile was used as the testing geometry. All tests were performed at 600 degrees C in air. The time-dependent torque response was recorded for each 60 min test to investigate trends in friction as surfaces roughened and debris deposits built up. Candidate materials included Stellite 6B, Pleuco 33 (a white cast iron), nitrided stainless steel Type 310, IDM 5399 (a high-silicon, molybdenum iron), and coatings of both Tribaloy T-400 and Stellite 3 on stainless steel. Measurements of the damaged areas on the scuffed tiles were used to calculate a specific normal load and plot it versus the roughness of the worn tiles to map experimental results in a way that indicated the severity of scuffing for each material combination. Data on the map were annotated to reflect visual observations of the extent of damage as well. Using this test method and the foregoing criteria, nitrided type 310 stainless steel against T-400 gave the best overall performance. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI MICROSTRUCTURE AND RESISTANCE TO CRACKING OF MODIFIED AL-SI AND AL-CR
   DIFFUSION COATINGS ON ZS6K NICKEL-BASED SUPERALLOYS
SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB The subject of the investigations was a superalloy with the following chemical composition: 0.14 wt.% C, 10.2 wt.% Cr, 5.3 wt.% Al, 2.8 wt.% Ti, 3.7 wt.% Mo, 5.2 wt.% W, 4.7 wt.% Co, 1.5 wt.% Fe and the balance nickel. A pack cementation technique of coating was applied. Acoustic emission signals were recorded as a function of specimen elongation (SIGMAN-epsilon). The values of elongation (epsilon0) at the moment of the first crack appearance and at the beginning of rapid fracture were measured.
   The crack resistances of the aluminide, silicoaluminide and chromoaluminide diffusion coatings were the main subject of the studies performed. If we take the co parameter as a crack resistance criterion it was found that, when compared with the aluminide coatings, Al-Si and Al-Cr coatings are less resistant. The crack morphologies of aluminium and Al-Cr coatings were similar in character. Among the typical features were cracks that did not spread through the entire layer thickness and discontinuous cracks with branches. In the depleted zone of the coatings, cracks developed along the NiAl phase grain boundaries.

TI Deposition of silicon modified aluminide coatings on nickel base
   superalloys by pack cementation process
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The equilibrium partial pressures of vapour species generated in halide activated pack powder mixtures at high temperatures were calculated for a series of compositions using thermochemical analysis tools. The results obtained were applied to identify suitable activators and pack compositions for codepositing Al and Si to form diffusion coatings on nickel base superalloys by the pack cementation process. The calculation results suggested that compositions of the pack powder mixtures activated by CrCl(3.)6H(2)O may be adjusted to create deposition conditions favourable for codepositing Al and Si, but, those activated by AlF3 or AlCl3 may only deposit Al. A series of coating deposition experiments were also carried out at 1000degreesC and 1100degreesC and the results obtained confirmed that, with adequate control of pack compositions and deposition conditions, codeposition of Al and Si can be achieved with CrCl(3.)6H(2)O activated pack powder mixtures. A mixture of elemental Al and Si powders may be used as a depositing source instead of using Al - Si master alloy powders as conventionally recommended. The coatings could be formed either through the inward diffusions of Al and Si or through the outward diffusion of Ni together with other substrate elements such as Cr and Co, depending on the deposition temperature used. Prolonged deposition at 1100degreesC led to the formation of a coating with a multilayered structure consisting of an outer nickel silicide layer and a middle Si modified NiAl layer followed by a diffusion zone. The pack compositions and deposition conditions may be adjusted to control the microstructure of the coatings formed by the codeposition process. (C) 2003 Iom Communications Ltd.

TI Insight into gamma-Ni/gamma '-Ni3Al interfacial energy affected by
   alloying elements
SO MATERIALS & DESIGN
AB Interfacial energy (sigma(gamma/gamma ')) of the gamma-Ni/gamma '-Ni3Al interface is critical to understand and design Ni-based superalloys. In the present work, a first-principles methodology with constrained relaxations has been used to study the effect of dilute alloying element (X) on sigma(gamma/gamma ') of the (100) coherent interface, where the sixteen X's include Al, Co, Cr, Fe, Hf, Mo, Nb, Pd, Pt, Re, Ru, Ta, Ti, W, Y, and Zr. sigma(gamma/gamma) = 19mJ/m(2) has been predicted for the unalloyed gamma/gamma ' interface, agreeing well with the previous estimations. It is found that the sigma(gamma/gamma) value is the lowest when alloying element is in gamma-Ni, while the addition to gamma '-Ni3Al increases sigma(gamma/gamma) due mainly to the in-plane lattice expansion. Specifically, our calculations show that alloying elements Mo, W, and Re have the largest effect on the sigma(gamma/gamma) value by decreasing it to 4-5 mJ/m(2) when partitioned to gamma-Ni; Ru and Pt are shown to increase greatly the sigma(gamma/gamma) value up to 2528 mJ/m(2) when partitioned to gamma-Ni; all ternary additions substituting for Ni in gamma '-Ni3Al increase sigma(gamma/gamma) except for Pt; and for Ti and Ta, which segregate strongly to gamma '-Ni3Al and substitute for Al, the sigma(gamma/gamma) values increase to 32 and 35 mJ/m2, respectively.

TI Interfacial reactions of a MAX phase/superalloy hybrid
SO SURFACE AND INTERFACE ANALYSIS
AB Oxidation resistant, strain tolerant MAX phase coatings are of general interest for high temperature applications. Accordingly, Cr2AlC MAX phase coupons were vacuum diffusion bonded to an advanced turbine disk alloy at 1100 degrees C for compatibility studies. The interface revealed an inner diffusion zone consisting of similar to 10 mu m of -Ni(Co)Al, decorated with various (Ni,Co)(3)Al, Ta(Ti,Nb)C, and W(Cr,Mo)(3)B-2 precipitates. On the Cr2AlC side, an additional similar to 40-mu m Al-depletion zone of Cr7C3 formed an interconnected network with the -Ni(Co)Al. On the superalloy side, enhanced carbide precipitation developed over a depth of similar to 80 mu m. Subsequent annealing for 100h and 1000h at 800 degrees C coarsened some features, enhanced TCP precipitation in the superalloy, but only enlarged the diffusion layers by similar to 5 mu m at most. Because of Al depletion from the MAX phase and corresponding Al enrichment of the alloy, the reaction zone displayed similarities to an oxidized Cr2AlC surface and an aluminized superalloy, respectively.

TI EVALUATION OF PARTITIONING RATIOS OF RE ATOMS IN
   NI-AL-RE-X(X-CR,MO,W,TI,TA,NB,CO) QUATERNARY ALLOYS
SO TETSU TO HAGANE-JOURNAL OF THE IRON AND STEEL INSTITUTE OF JAPAN
AB In order to examine alloying behaviour of rhenium (Re) and its effect on the properties of Ni-based superalloys, the partitioning ratio of Re atoms between the gamma and the gamma' phases and also the phase stability were investigated using Ni-Al-Re-X(X : Cr, Mo, W, Ti, Ta, Nb, Co) quaternary alloys. When those elements, X, which occupy preferably either Al sites or both Ni and Al sites in the Ni3Al(gamma') compound were added to the Ni-Al-Re ternary alloys, the trend of the partitioning of the Re atoms into the gamma phase became considerably high in these alloys. Also, the compositional limit of a gamma + gamma' two phase region in the phase diagram was found to be 3 similar to 4(mol%) for X(X : Mo, W, Ta, Nb) and 5 similar to 6(mol%) for Ti in Ni-Al-Re-X quaternary alloys. The results on the partitioning ratio were analyzed with the alloying vectors defined by two d-electrons parameters. As the result, it was shown that the partitioning behaviour of Re atoms in the Ni-Al-Re-X quaternary alloys were predictable using the alloying vectors.

TI Strengthening effects of alloying elements W and Re on Ni3Al: A
   first-principles study
SO COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB The structural stabilities, mechanical and thermodynamic properties of pure and alloyed Ni3Al systems have been investigated systematically, based on density functional theory and Debye-Gruneisen model. Close attentions are paid to alloying elements W and Re by studying the strengthening effects of single-alloying element W, Re, Mo, Ta, Ru and co-alloying elements WRe, WMo, ReMo, WTa, ReTa, WRu, ReRu, which substitute the Al site and the nearest neighboring Al-Al sites, respectively. The calculated formation energies and elastic constants show that all the alloyed Ni3Al are thermodynamically and mechanically stable. It is found that alloying elements W has similar effects on the mechanical and thermodynamic properties of Ni3Al to those of Re, which suggests a possibility of replacing Re with W in Ni-based single crystal superalloys. In addition, co-alloyings with different elements have no distinct synergistic enhancement but simple combined effect on the mechanical properties of Ni3Al. The enhanced chemical bondings between the alloying atoms W/Re and the neighboring host atoms Ni are considered to be the main strengthening mechanisms in W/Re alloyed Ni3Al systems.

TI Microstructural analysis of creep exposed IN617 alloy
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Ni base alloys such as IN617 are one of the preferred choices for steam turbine components used by fossil fuelled power generation plants. IN617 is a solid solution strengthened Ni based superalloy containing similar to 23%Cr, 12%Co and 9%Mo with low content of precipitation strengthening elements Al, Ti and Nb. In the 'as received' (solution annealed condition), the microstructure consists of primary carbides (M23C6) and occasional TiN particles dispersed in a single phase austenitic matrix. Owing to high temperature exposure and the creep deformation processes that occur in service, evolution of the microstructure occurs. This results in secondary precipitation and precipitate coarsening, both on grain boundaries and intragranularly in areas of high dislocation density. The influence of creep deformation on the solution treated IN617 alloy at an operating condition of 650 degrees C/574 h, with emphasis on the morphology and distribution of carbide/nitride precipitation is discussed. The applied stress was at an intermediate level.

SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY
AB Microstructure in the weld line (WL) zone produced by inertial friction welding has been studied for a series of RR1000-RR1000 welds using transmission electron and scanning electron microscopy. A fully recrystallised fine grain structure was found to form throughout the WL zone, characterized by straight and smooth grain boundaries, high energy status and modified grain boundary chemistry due to very fast cooling after welding. Very fine gamma' particles with unimodal size distribution were reprecipitated in the WL zone. The fine gamma' particles are spherical in shape, high in number density and characterized by an imbalanced chemistry, containing less Al, Ti, Ni, Ta gamma'-forming elements but more Cr, Co, Mo gamma-forming elements than all types of parent gamma' particles. As a result, a hard and strong WL zone was produced by the inertial friction welding. (C) 2011 Elsevier BM. All rights reserved.

TI Numerical Simulation for gamma/theta Interface Properties of Ni Base
   Superalloy
SO RARE METAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING
AB By using molecular dynamics method with the second nearest neighbor modified embedded-atom method (2NN MEAM) interatomic potential, we studied the gamma/theta-DO22 interfacial structure of Ni-Al-V superalloy at different compositions, and calculated the interfacial energy and the work of separation on the interfaces. The research shows that with the Al atom concentration increasing, the interfacial energy increases while the work of separation decreases; with the concentration of V atoms increasing, the interfacial energy increases first and then decreases; but the change of atomic concentration has little effect on the work of separation; and the interfacial energy and the work of separation are closely related to the interfacial migration. The results can be used to further study the dynamic behavior of Ni-Al-V superalloys in the process of precipitation, such as the composition segregation and interfacial migration, so the research has great guiding significance to the alloy design.

AB The layer-by-layer building of monolithic, 3D metal components from selectively melted powder layers using laser or electron beams is a novel form of 3D printing or additive manufacturing. Microstructures created in these 3D products can involve novel, directional solidification structures which can include crystallographically oriented grains containing columnar arrays of precipitates characteristic of a microstructural architecture. These microstructural architectures are advantageously rendered in 3D image constructions involving light optical microscopy and scanning and transmission electron microscopy observations. Microstructural evolution can also be effectively examined through 3D image sequences which, along with x-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis in the x-y and x-z planes, can effectively characterize related crystallographic/texture variances. This paper compares 3D microstructural architectures in Co-base and Ni-base superalloys, columnar martensitic grain structures in 17-4 PH alloy, and columnar copper oxides and dislocation arrays in copper.

TI Creep behavior of a gamma '-strengthened Co-base alloy with zero
   gamma/gamma '-lattice misfit at 800 degrees C, 196 MPa
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS RESEARCH
AB Deformation and structural behavior of an experimental gamma'-strengthened Co-base alloy during creep at 800 degrees C and 196 MPa have been investigated. The characteristic features of this alloy are zero gamma/gamma'-lattice misfit and a fine gamma/gamma'-microstructure. In the initial condition, the gamma'-precipitates in this alloy are small (size of about 100 nm), have polyhedral morphology, and are separated by the very narrow c-channels (width of about 10 nm). The tests performed up to about 1% creep strain (about 500 h creep time) gave creep curves with a slow constant strain rate and without an apparent transient creep, typical for superalloys with nonzero misfit. In this initial stage of creep, entering of the narrow c-channels by dislocations is blocked by a strong Orowan force. The micromechanism of creep was identified as an octahedral glide of < 011 > superdislocations simultaneously in two phases, gamma and gamma'. The gamma/gamma'-microstructure with zero misfit shows no rafting but rapidly coarsens isotropically. It is concluded that zero misfit is beneficial at the initial stages of the creep but is unfavourable for longterm creep because of the continuous microstructural coarsening.

TI Theoretical investigations of solid-solution effect on the twinning of
   Ni
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF SOLIDS
AB In terms of first-principles method, the influences of Co, Cr, Fe, Ta, Mo and W atoms on the generalized stacking fault energy of Ni are investigated. The bridge between stacking fault energy and twinning is comprehensively constructed by various previous criterions. Our calculation results indicate that the addition of Mo has the maximum positive effect on the twinning of Ni, while Cr shows the minimum effect. The ranking sequence of twinning abilities can be drawn as: Ni-Mo > Ni-Fe approximate to Ni-Ta > Ni-W > Ni-Co > Ni > Ni-Cr. On the other hand, the addition of Fe or Ta significantly reduces the intrinsic stacking fault energy of Ni, which is beneficial to obtain the dislocation glide during deformations. Based on the analysis of charge density, the bonding characteristics near the fault plane are observed to reveal the electronic redistribution during the slipping. It is found that the intrinsic stacking fault configuration and double-layers twin configuration reconstitute stable bonds near the fault plane corresponding to two valley points of the GSFE curve, while these bonds will be disrupted under a series of displacements.

TI Microstructural Evolution and High Strain Rate Mechanical Property of
   Cobalt Superalloy Contain Titanium
SO SAINS MALAYSIANA
AB The high strain rate properties and microstructure observations of cobalt base superalloyd contains 0.9% Ti were investigated using Hopkinson bar. These cobalt base superalloys are tested at strain rates of 2x10(3), 3x10(3) and 4x10(3) s(-1) and at different temperatures (25, 500 and 900 degrees C), respectively. It is found that the stress flow and strain rate sensitivity increases with increasing strain rate but decrease with increasing temperature. The microstructure observations confirm that the high strain rate mechanical behavior of the cobalt base superalloys specimens are directly related to the effects of the strain rate, temperature and the evolution of the microstructural texture. The strengthening mechanism in cobalt base superalloys is the multiplication of dislocation. The dislocation density increases with increasing strain rate but decrease with increasing temperature.

TI Solution heat-treatment of Nb-modified MAR-M247 superalloy
SO MATERIALS CHARACTERIZATION
AB MAR-M247 superalloy has excellent mechanical properties and good oxidation resistance at elevated temperatures. Niobium is an element known as gamma' phase hardener in nickel-based superalloys, besides promoting homogeneous distribution of MC carbides. This work is inserted in a project that aims to evaluate the total replacement of tantalum by niobium atoms in MAR-M247 superalloy (10.2 Co, 10.2 W, 8.5Cr, 5.6 Al, 1.6 Nb, 1.4 Hf, 1.1 Ti, 0.7 Mo, 0.15 C, 0.06 Zr, 0.015 13, Ni balance-wt.%). Based on microstructural characterizations (SEM and FEG-SEM, both with EDS) of the as-cast material and heat-treated materials as well as utilizing Thermocalc simulations and experiments of differential thermal analysis (DTA), heat-treatment at 1260 degrees C for 8 h was chosen as an ideal condition for the solution of Nb-modified MAR-M247 superalloy. The hardness of as-cast and ideally solution treated materials was 390 +/- 14 HV and 415 +/- 6 HV, respectively. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The corrosion of structural alloys in Gas Cooled Reactor environment appears to be a critical issue. The coolant helium proved to contain impurities mainly H-2, H2O, CO, and CH4 in the microbar range that interact with metallic materials at high temperature. Surface scale formation, bulk carburisation and/or decarburisation can occur, depending on the gas chemistry, the alloy composition and the temperature. These structural transformations can notably influence the component mechanical properties. A short review of the literature on the topic is first given. Corrosion tests with high chromium alloys and a Mo-based alloy were carried out at 750degreesC in a purposely-designed facility under simulated GCR helium. The first, rather short term, results showed that the Mo-based alloy was inert while the others alloys oxidised during at least 900 hours. The alloy with the higher Al and Ti contents exhibited poor oxidation resistance impeding its use as structural material without further investigations.

TI Estimation of gamma/gamma ' interfacial energy in Ni-Co base superalloy
   TMW-4M3
SO JOURNAL OF CRYSTAL GROWTH
AB The interfacial energy between the gamma and gamma ' phase in Ni-Co base superalloy TMW-4M3 was investigated using both a kinetic analysis of experimental data and a thermodynamic analysis. The coarsening rate of gamma' precipitates during the aging treatment process was analyzed using extended Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner theory, including the contribution of a full diffusion matrix with a thermodynamic calculation. The interfacial energies calculated from the coarsening kinetics using only the diagonal components were half as large as those using the off-diagonal contributions as well. The interfacial energy with full diffusion matrix contributions is about 75 mJ/m(2) between 1373 and 1413 K. In addition, the interfacial energy was also analyzed on the basis of the extended Becker's model (EBM), and the results, which ranged from 73.9 to 76.3 mJ/m(2 ), showed good agreements with those from the coarsening kinetics. A comparison of the interfacial energy between TMW-4M3 and several Ni base superalloys indicated an identical tendency of higher interfacial energy with a larger Ti/Al ratio. The off-diagonal terms of a diffusion matrix are very important in analyzing the coarsening kinetics of gamma' and gamma/gamma' the interfacial energy estimation using the EBM is a suitable method for TMW-4M3.

   and its application to single-crystal superalloy castings
SO METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND
   MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Instrumental errors in microsegregation measurements in multicomponent alloys complicate the treatment of randomly sampled data. In this article, two new alloy-independent data treatment algorithms are presented that are capable of separating the effects of scatter in the data from the underlying segregation trends, assigning each measurement location a unique fraction solid. These new methods are physically reasonable and result in improved estimates of segregation parameters, particularly the solute partitioning at the dendrite tip. This is demonstrated by determining the microsegregation in four successive generations of single-crystal (SX) nickel-based superalloys. Artificial, noise-induced, tails commonly seen in the microsegregation profiles are also minimized. A methodology for evaluating sorting schemes is introduced that does not depend upon a priori knowledge of the partitioning direction. Comparison is made to both other sorting methods and CALPHAD predicted partition coefficients. Implications for alloy design are reported, illustrating the interaction between solute species such as Ru, Re, Co, and W.

TI Effects of alloying element and temperature on the stacking fault
   energies of dilute Ni-base superalloys
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER
AB A systematic study of stacking fault energy (gamma(SF)) resulting from induced alias shear deformation has been performed by means of first-principles calculations for dilute Ni-base superalloys (Ni23X and Ni71X) for various alloying elements (X) as a function of temperature. Twenty-six alloying elements are considered, i.e., Al, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hf, Ir, Mn, Mo, Nb, Os, Pd, Pt, Re, Rh, Ru, Sc, Si, Ta, Tc, Ti, V, W, Y, Zn, and Zr. The temperature dependence of gamma(SF) is computed using the proposed quasistatic approach based on a predicted gamma(SF)-volume-temperature relationship. Besides gamma(SF), equilibrium volume and the normalized stacking fault energy (Gamma(SF) = gamma(SF)/Gb, with G the shear modulus and b the Burgers vector) are also studied as a function of temperature for the 26 alloying elements. The following conclusions are obtained: all alloying elements X studied herein decrease the gamma(SF) of fcc Ni, approximately the further the alloying element X is from Ni on the periodic table, the larger the decrease of gamma(SF) for the dilute Ni-X alloy, and roughly the gamma(SF) of Ni-X decreases with increasing equilibrium volume. In addition, the values of gamma(SF) for all Ni-X systems decrease with increasing temperature (except for Ni-Cr at higher Cr content), and the largest decrease is observed for pure Ni. Similar to the case of the shear modulus, the variation of gamma(SF) for Ni-X systems due to various alloying elements is traceable from the distribution of (magnetization) charge density: the spherical distribution of charge density around a Ni atom, especially a smaller sphere, results in a lower value of gamma(SF) due to the facility of redistribution of charges. Computed stacking fault energies and the related properties are in favorable accord with available experimental and theoretical data.

Interdiffusion behavior between the Pt-Ir films and substrates was investigated in terms of chemical composition, phase constitution and morphology. X-ray analysis revealed that annealed specimens consisted of several fcc solid solutioned phases with various lattice parameters, together with ordered intermetallic compounds (Ll(2)-(Pt,Ni)(3)Al and B2-(IrNi)Al), due to the inward diffusion of Pt and Ir from the electrodeposited films to the superalloy substrates, and the outward diffusion of solute elements (Ni, Al, Cr, Co) in the superalloy substrates into the films during annealing. The depth concentration analysis indicated that the Pt-36.1 Ir film effectively retarded the outward diffusion of solute elements, especially nickel, from the substrate.

TI Preventing high-temperature oxidation of Co-Cr-based dental alloys by
   boron doping
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY B
AB Biomedical Co-Cr-based alloys used in dental restorations are usually subjected to high-temperature treatments during manufacturing. Therefore, it is practically essential to characterise and control the oxide films formed on the surfaces of these alloys during heat treatment in terms of material loss, the accuracy of fit, and the aesthetics of dental restorations. In this work, the effects of boron doping on the surface oxide films formed on Ni-free Co-28Cr-9W-1Si (mass%) dental alloys under short-term exposure to high temperatures, which simulate the manufacturing process of porcelain-fused-to-metal (PFM) restorations, were investigated. The surface oxides primarily consisted of Cr2O3 in all prepared alloys. The chemical composition of these surface layers varies with the B concentration in the bulk, with the addition of boron stabilising the dense Cr2O3 phase in the oxide films. Nanoscale boron enrichment is clearly observed at the interface between the oxide films and the metal substrate, with the oxidation of boron atoms leading to the formation of a B2O3 layer. Since B2O3 and Cr2O3 prevent oxygen diffusion, the surface oxide films on the boron-containing alloys are thinner; however, no additional thinning was observed when increasing the boron content from 0.01 to 0.8 mass%. It was also found that a small amount of boron does not degrade the corrosion properties of the alloys in a 0.9% NaCl solution. The results obtained in this study will aid in the improvement of manufacturing processes, and ultimately, the performance of PFM restorations.

SO PHILOSOPHICAL MAGAZINE
AB An analytical transmission electron microscopy study was performed on the nature of nanosize secondary phase precipitates that form in standard heat-treated commercial nickel base superalloy IN 738. In addition to M5B3 borides and M23C6 carbides, the precipitates were found to also consist of particles of M2B-type boride phase, which is previously unreported in the alloy and rarely reported in nickel base superalloys. The M2B borides exhibited a dual crystallographic structure: body centered tetragonal and face centered orthorhombic. Analyses of electron diffraction patterns and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy images indicated that both crystal structures can co-exist in a single M2B particle as an inter-growth with the formation of planar defects. Crystallographic relationship between microconstituent phases in the heat-treated alloy were elucidated and the influence of the borides on resistance to grain boundary liquation cracking during high-temperature material processing, such as laser beam treatment, is discussed.

It has been shown that an increase in the tungsten content induces the following changes: Young's modulus changes from 240 to 259 GPa and the microhardness HV changes from 290 to 413 MPa. The Curie temperature of the intermetallic gamma' phase (L1(2)) grows from 1025 to 1049 K, and the saturation magnetization of the alloys decreases. The value of the coercive force also increases, from 1 to 500 Oe. The calculations of the specific heat of the gamma' (L1(2))-gamma (dcc) phase transition has shown that the highest amount of heat (304 J/g) is absorbed upon the phase transition in the sample containing the largest amount of tungsten (12.6 at %). The results obtained indicate the diffusion character of the transition, the rate of which is controlled by the diffusion of the slowest component of the alloy (in this case, tungsten). It has been found that the solvus temperature of the gamma' phase increases from 1009 to 1044A degrees C with an increase in the tungsten content from 4.6 to 12.6 at %.

SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB In this report we investigate the onset and evolution of precipitation in the early stages of ageing in the alloy WE 91, a variant of the Ni-Fe-Cr superalloy Inconel 718 (IN718). Transmission electron microscopy and atom probe tomography were used to study the size and volume fraction of gamma' and gamma '' precipitates and the extent of pre-precipitate clustering of Al/Ti and Nb.
   Co-located gamma' and gamma '' precipitates were observed from the shortest ageing times that precipitates could be visualised using atom probe. At shorter times, prior to the observation of precipitates, clustering of Al/Ti and Nb was shown to occur. The respective volume fraction of the gamma' and gamma '' precipitates and the clustering of Al/Ti and Nb suggest that gamma '' nucleates prior to gamma' during ageing at 706 degrees C for this alloy.

SO CORROSION SCIENCE
AB Corrosion behavior of the N5 superalloy (Ni-7.0 Cr-6.2 Al-7.5 Co-5.0 W-1.5 Mo-6.5 Ta-3.0 Re) and two nanocrystalline coatings prepared by magnetron sputtering is investigated in chlorine and water vapor environment at 700 degrees C. The alloy shows low corrosion resistance. Its oxide scale spalls off readily and includes porous NiO outer layer and NiCr(Al)(2)O-4 inner one. The nanocrystalline coating performs better. Its oxide scale consists of Al2O3, NiO and Ta2O5. Chlorination and/or oxidation of Ta ruined compactness of scale. The yttrium modified nanocrystalline coating provides the highest corrosion resistance. Its scale is exclusively alumina. Yttrium inhibits the outward diffusion of Ta.

   superalloy
SO MATERIALS CHARACTERIZATION
AB Analytical electron microscopy and spectroscopy analyses of the fusion zone (FZ) microstructure in autogenous laser beam welded Haynes 282 (HY 282) superalloy were performed. The micro-segregation patterns observed in the FZ indicate that Co, Cr and Al exhibited a nearly uniform distribution between the dendrite core and interdendritic regions while Ti and Mo were rejected into the interdendritic liquid during the weld solidification. Transmission electron diffraction analysis and energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis revealed the second phase particles formed along the FZ interdendritic region to be Ti-Mo rich MC-type carbide particles. Weld FZ solidification cracking, which is sometimes associated with the formation of gamma-gamma' eutectic in gamma' precipitation strengthened nickel-base superalloys, was not observed in the HY 282 superalloy. Modified primary solidification path due to carbon addition in the newly developed superalloy is used to explain preclusion of weld FZ solidification cracking in the material. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

TI Friction and wear behaviour of Inconel 718 alloy fabricated by selective
   laser melting after heat treatments
SO PHILOSOPHICAL MAGAZINE LETTERS
AB The effect of heat treatments (solution and double aging) on friction and wear behaviour of Inconel 718 (IN718) alloy fabricated by selective laser melting (SLM) were studied. After heat treatment of solution and double aging, the friction and wear of the alloy have been improved. The worn surfaces of heat-treated IN718 alloy became smoother, and micro-ploughing became shallower. After solid solution hearting, a portion of the Laves phase ((Ni, Fe, Co)(2)(Nb, Ti, Mo)) dissolves into the matrix, after which the gamma '' phase (Ni3Nb) andthe equilibrium phase of the delta phase (Ni3Nb) precipitates during double ageing. After solution and double aging, nano-scale gamma ' (Ni-3(Al, Ti)) and gamma '' phases distribute homogeneously in the matrix, which improves the material hardness and wear resistance of the SLMed IN718 alloy.

TI Effect of doping Mg on the microstructure and mechanical behaviours of a
   novel Co-9Al-4.5W-4.5Mo-2Ta-0.02B alloy at room- and high-temperatures
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB The microstructure and mechanical behaviour of a novel magnesium (Mg) doped Co-9Al-4.5W-4.5Mo-2Ta-0.02B alloy (doped 0.1, 0.3, 0.7 and 1.0 at.% Mg, referred to as 0.1Mg, 0.3Mg, 0.7Mg and 1Mg alloys hereafter, respectively) at room-and high-temperatures have been investigated. All alloys aged at 800 degrees C for 50 h consist of a Co solid-solution matrix (gamma-Co-ss) and nano-scale cuboidal gamma'-Co-3(Al, W) precipitates. Mg is observed to segregate primarily at the grain boundaries and the gamma'-Co-3(Al, W) phase. In the 0.7Mg and 1Mg alloys more Mg segregation at the grain boundaries decreases the fraction of Sigma 1 similar to 3 type grain boundaries and the capability of excluding impurity O from the grain boundaries. With decreased Sigma 1 similar to 3 boundaries and higher O content, the 0.7Mg and 1Mg alloys fracture in a mixed transgranular-intergranular mode at room temperature with lower strength and ductility under tension. However, the 0.1 and 0.3Mg alloys fracture in a transgranular mode with higher strength and ductility. The four alloys exhibit compressive flow stress anomalies at 700 degrees C and the strength obviously decreases when the nominal Mg contents increase to 0.7-1 at.% at 600-800 degrees C. As for the 0.1Mg and 0.3Mg alloys, the strengths from room temperature to 800 degrees C are higher and not obviously affected by the nominal Mg contents, primarily owing to the two alloys having almost the same and higher Sigma 1 similar to 3 grain boundary fraction and the lower O concentration in the grain boundary.

TI Effect of Volume Fraction on the Coarsening of Pb Nanophase in Al-Pb
   Nanocomposite Alloys Prepared by High Energy Ball Milling
SO RARE METAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING
AB The effect of volume fraction on the coarsening of Pb nanophase in Al-Pb nanocomposite alloys prepared by high energy ball milling has been studied by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The coarsening of Pb nanophase with different volume fractions in Al-Pb nanocomposite alloys follows the cubic growth law even though the size of the constituent phase is in nanometer range. The coarsening rate of Pb nanophase increases distinctly as the volume fraction increases, and the variation of coarsening rate is greater than the theoretical prediction in this composition range. The activation energy for coarsening of Pb nanophase does not vary with volume fraction. The coarsening of Pb nanophase is controlled by grain boundary diffusion for solute atoms in solvent matrix.

TI The alloying element dependence of the local lattice deformation and the
   elastic properties of Ni3Al: A molecular dynamics simulation
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Molecular dynamics (MD) together with the modified analytical embedded atom method (MAEAM) is employed to study the alloying elements (Re, Ru, Co, and Ta) dependence of the elastic properties of L1(2)-Ni3Al. The investigations indicate that the calculated elastic properties of Ni3Al are in reasonable agreement with the previous results. The substituting formation energies of the alloying elements in Ni3Al are calculated to determine the site preference. It is found out that Re, Ru, and Ta atoms prefer to occupy the Al sites, and the Co atom prefers to occupy the Ni site. Based on Re, Ru, and Ta substituting the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th nearest-neighbor atoms, we ascertain that the substituting manners of these alloying elements have a decisive effect on the bulk modulus and the local crystal lattice of Ni3Al. Moreover, for Re, the bonding interaction plays a predominant role in the improvement in the bulk modulus of Ni3Al, whereas the size effect of Ru and Ta on the improvement in the bulk modulus is more obvious. Finally, the potential reasons of which the alloying elements enhance the bulk modulus are discussed in details. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.

TI Co-deposited chromium-aluminide coatings .3. Origins of nonequilibrium
   effects
SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB A detailed analysis of the time-dependent factors affecting the chromium-aluminization of the nickel-base superalloy Rene 80H in cementation packs at 1120 degrees C has been carried out. The packs contained a 4% NaCl+2% NH4Cl mixed activator and a Cr-5 wt.% Al master alloy. The analysis involved measuring the residual pack activator-mixture content and master alloy composition as functions of deposition time, and using the data to calculate equilibrium partial pressures in the pack as a function of time. It is shown that both activator-mixture content and master alloy composition change with time, consequently leading to changes in the pack gas phase composition. The changes in the pack environment are then used to explain the time-dependence of coating surface composition: a simplified mechanism involving a combined parabolic accumulation of beta-NiAl and two-stage linear accumulation of alpha-Cr is described.

TI Topologically close-packed phases in binary transition-metal compounds:
   matching high-throughput ab initio calculations to an empirical
   structure map
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB In steels and single-crystal superalloys the control of the formation of topologically close-packed (TCP) phases is critical for the performance of the material. The structural stability of TCP phases in multi-component transition-metal alloys may be rationalized in terms of the average valence-electron count (N) over bar and the composition-dependent relative volume-difference Delta(V) over bar / (V) over bar We elucidate the interplay of these factors by comparing density-functional theory calculations to an empirical structure map based on experimental data. In particular, we calculate the heat of formation for the TCP phases A15, C14, C15, C36, x, mu and sigma for all possible binary occupations of the Wyckoff positions. We discuss the isovalent systems V/Nb-Ta to highlight the role of atomic-size difference and observe the expected stabilization of C14/C15/C36/mu by Delta(V) over bar / (V) over bar at Delta N = 0 in V-Ta. In the systems V/Nb-Re, we focus on the well-known trend of A15 -> sigma -> x stability with increasing (N) over bar and show that the influence of Delta(V) over bar / (V) over bar is too weak to stabilize C14/C15/C36/mu in Nb-Re. As an example for a significant influence of both (N) over bar and Delta(V) over bar / (V) over bar, we also consider the systems Cr/Mo-Co. Here the sequence A15 ->sigma -> x is observed in both systems but in Mo-Co the large size-mismatch stabilizes C14/C15/C36/mu. We also include V/Nb-Co that cover the entire valence range of TCP stability and also show the stabilization of C14/C15/C36/mu. Moreover, the combination of a large volume-difference with a large mismatch in valence-electron count reduces the stability of the A15/sigma/x phases in Nb-Co as compared to V-Co. By comparison to nonmagnetic calculations we also find that magnetism is of minor importance for the structural stability of TCP phases in Cr/Mo-Co and in V/ Nb-Co.

AB Correlative high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy are used to study deformation-induced planar faults in the single-crystal superalloy MD2 crept at 800 degrees C and 650 MPa. Segregation of Cr and Co at microtwins, anti-phase boundaries (APB), and complex/superlattice extrinsic and intrinsic stacking faults (CESF/SESF and CISF/SISF) is confirmed and quantified. The extent of this is found to depend upon the fault type, being most pronounced for the APB. The CESF/SESF is studied in detail due to its role as a precursor of the microtwins causing the majority of plasticity under these conditions. Quantitative modeling is carried out to rationalize the findings; the experimental results are consistent with a greater predicted velocity for the lengthening of the CESF/SESF-compared with the other types of fault-and hence confirm its role in the diffusion-assisted plasticity needed for the microtwinning mechanism to be operative.

TI Superior cyclic life of thermal barrier coatings with advanced bond
   coats on single-crystal superalloys
SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB Advanced thermal barrier coatings are essential to further increase the efficiency of gas turbine engines. One limiting factor of the TBC lifetime is the temperature dependent formation of the thermally grown oxide (TGO) during thermal exposure resulting in critical stress levels at the top coat-bond coat interface. Oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) bond coats demonstrated slower oxygen scale growth during thermal exposure in comparison to standard bond coats.
   In this study for the first time TBC samples on single-crystal substrates (comparable to CMSX4) with thin ODS Co-based flash coats on the same Co-based bond coat (Amdry 995) and a porous atmospherically plasma sprayed (APS) yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) topcoat were manufactured by thermal spray techniques and evaluated with respect to their thermal cyclic behavior. As the major performance test cyclic burner rigs, which can establish thermal conditions similar to those in gas turbines, were applied.
   TBC samples with the new material combination show superior performance compared to previous samples. Cross sections of the samples were analyzed by scanning electron and laser scanning microscopy. Lifetime data and failure mode of the samples are discussed with respect to material properties such as thermal expansion coefficients, microstructural changes and TGO growth.

SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB Microstructures and mechanical properties of Al-Ni-Co-Fe-Cr high-entropy alloys (HEAs) were investigated by systematically varying transition metals instead of Al, within the chemical formula of Al2M14 (M represents different mutations of transition metals). The formation of different crystal structures (FCC, BCC, or FCC+BCC mixture) and its effects on the resulting mechanical properties of this series of HEAs, both in tension and compression, were evaluated. It was found that, in the BCC-dominated HEAs, ordered B2 precipitates were always coherently dispersed in the BCC solid-solution matrix. The shape of these B2 precipitates was strongly affected by the lattice misfit between the disordered BCC and ordered B2. A uniform distribution of cuboidal B2 particles could be obtained by properly adjusting M, thus the lattice misfit, in a manner similar to that in Ni-based superalloys, Strengthening effects caused by different BCC/B2 morphologies were also estimated and compared with experimental measurements. The optimal strengthening as a function of the shape and size of the coherent precipitates was discussed in light of the lattice misfit in these HEAs. (C) 2018 Acta Materialia Inc.

TI LONG-RANGE ORDERING KINETICS AND ORDERING ENERGY IN NI3AL-BASED

AB Chemical long-range order kinetics were studied for the Ll2-ordered gamma'-phase domains of the quasi-binary systems Ni75AL25-xMx (M=Fe, Mn, Cr, 0 less-than-or-equal-to x less-than-or-equal-to 25), where the gamma'-phase stability (ordering energy) rapidly decreases with increasing M-component concentration x.
   The sample gamma' homogeneity was tested by means of transmission electron microscopy. The 'order-order' relaxations measured by means of in-situ resistometry indicated that an increase in x caused a systematic decrease in the activation energy, E(A), of homogeneous long-range order kinetics.
   Discussing a possible influence of various parameters, it was concluded that the observed decrease in E(A) was predominantly due to an effect of the ordering energy on the bulk vacancy diffusion in these Ll2-ordered compounds.

TI Solubility and ordering of Ti, Ta, Mo and W on the Al sublattice in
   L1(2)-Co3Al
SO INTERMETALLICS
AB Co-Al-W-based alloys are promising new materials for high-temperature applications. They owe their high-temperature strength to hardening by ternary L1(2)-Co-3(Al1-xWx) precipitates, which may form even though binary Co3Al is not stable. In the current work, density functional theory calculations are performed to study the solubility and ordering of the transition metals W, Mo, Ti, and Ta at the Al sublattice in L1(2)-Co3Al. The sublattice disorder is modelled with a newly parametrised cluster expansion and compared to results using special quasi-random structures. Our results for W and Mo show that the mixing energy exhibits a minimum at approximately x = 0.7. However, the computed small values of the mixing energies indicate that W and Mo atoms are fully disordered with the Al atoms already at low temperatures. For Ti and Ta we find no sizeable driving force for ordering with the Al atoms. The computed solubilities on the Al sublattice obtained are in the range of 40-80 meV/atom for W and Mo and less than 25 meV/atom for Ti and Ta. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

CL Wildbad Kreuth, GERMANY
AB Aerospace gas turbine disks operate in an environment of relatively high stresses caused by centrifugal forces and elevated temperatures. Because of the strong mechanical requirements and narrow specifications of such parts not only a correct, defect free final geometry is necessary, but also a defined microstructure. Even though the microstructure evolution during thermo-mechanical processing is well studied and understood for superalloys like IN718, the influences cannot easily be described analytically. Thus simulation tools are used to assure process stability and to optimize design parameters to meet the tough requirements in aerospace industries.
   Microstructure simulation of IN718 (and other materials) is well established at Bohler Schmiedetechnik GmbH & Co KG and appreciated by its customers. The advent of the newly developed nickel-base superalloy ATI Allvac (R) 718Plus (TM) led to extensive investigations and the development of an adapted microstructure model by Bohler Schmiedetechnik GmbH & Co KG and its research partners.
   Aim of this paper is a comparison of the microstructure evolution in IN718 and ATI Allvac (R) 718Plus (TM) during the thermo-mechanical treatment of turbine disks. Influences of process temperature, strain and strain rate on the final grain size are discussed by finite element simulations with a coupled grain structure model. Experimental results from trial forgings are compared with the outcome of the microstructure simulations.

AB The influence of titanium element, strain rate and tested temperatures on the mechanical properties and microstructural characteristics will be investigated in this paper. These cobalt-based superalloys are tested using material testing system (MTS) at strain rates of 10(-3), 10(-2) and 10(-1) s(-1) and at temperatures of 700, 500 and 25 degrees C, respectively. It is found that the flow stress increases with increasing strain rate and Ti, but decreases with increasing temperature. Furthermore, the strain rate sensitivity increases with increasing strain rate, but decreases with increasing temperature. The microstructural observations confirm that the mechanical response of the cobalt superalloy specimens is directly related to the effects of the titanium contents, strain rate and temperature on the evolution of the microstructure. It can be observed that the strengthening effect in cobalt-based superalloys is a result primarily of dislocation multiplication. The dislocation density increases with increasing strain rate, but decreases with increasing temperature.

TI A thermodynamic model applicable to liquid gamma gamma prime phase
   equilibrium in superalloys
SO CANADIAN METALLURGICAL QUARTERLY
AB A thermodynamic model has been developed to address the gamma, gamma prime and liquid phase equilibrium for dilute single crystal gas turbine alloys such as CMSX-10. The model is based on a review of the Ni-X (X = Al, Co, Cr, Re, Ta, W) binary systems where the observed binary phase diagrams are well reproduced with self-consistent thermodynamic models that incorporate, when available, measured thermodynamic properties. These models are then interpolated using the Kohler scheme to address the gamma-gamma prime equilibrium observed in the related Al-Ni-X ternary systems. The gamma and liquid phases are modelled using a substitutional solution formalism; the gamma prime phase is modelled as the stoichiometric compound Ni3Al into which are dissolved compounds of the Ni3X type. The role of coherency in superalloy microstructure and the importance of a sound knowledge of constituent binary systems are discussed. The calculated phase equilibrium compositions and phase transformation temperatures are compared to the literature data for CMSX-10.

TI Cyclic Oxidation Behavior of an EB-PVD CoCrAlY Coating Influenced by
   Substrate/coating Interdiffusion
SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF AERONAUTICS
AB To reveal the influence of substrate/coating interdiffusion on the cyclic oxidation property of a metallic coating, cyclic oxidation behavior of an EB-PVD CoCrAlY coating on directionally solidified Ni-based superalloy DZ125 at 1 050 degrees C is investigated. The 40 mu m thick CoCrAlY coating has a cyclic oxidation life of around 160 h, and the oxidation constant is 1.915x10(-7) mg(4).cm(-8).s(-1). However, severe spallation of the oxides containing Co, Cr, Ni, Ta and Ti occurs with longer cyclic oxidation. The degradation in oxidation resistance for the coating is related to the depletion of Al due to the oxide spallation and interdiffusion. Severe interdiffusion between the coating and underlying substrate occurs at 1 050 degrees C. The composition of the substrate has an important effect on the thermal cycling lifetime of the coating. The influencing mechanism is discussed.

TI ANISOTROPIC CREEP IN A Ni-BASED SINGLE CRYSTAL SUPERALLOY
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB Constant load creep tests were performed on the [001] and [011] oriented Ni-Co-Cr-Mo-W-Al-Ti-Ta single crystal superalloys. The [001] oriented alloy has much longer creep life than that of [011] oriented alloy, but the elongation of [011] oriented alloy is slightly higher under the condition of 750 degrees C/750 MPa. The average creep life and elongation of [001] oriented alloy are both higher than that of [011] oriented alloy at 982 degrees C/248 MPa, and the anisotropy occurs mainly during the accelerating creep stage, but anisotropic degree decreases obviously. The SEM analysis reveals gamma' phases are rafted in the two directions, which blocks the glide/climb of dislocations and causes creep hardening, the rafting of gamma' phase is the dominant reason to decrease of creep anisotropy at higher temperature. The TEM observation indicates deformation twins formed in [011] oriented alloy, which lowers the plasticity of the sample and induces the sample to fracture rapidly.

TI Effect of Fe addition on microstructures and mechanical properties of
   Ni- and C-free Co-Cr-Mo alloys
SO MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS
AB A series of Co-Cr-Mo alloys with Fe contents ranging from 5 to 20 mass% were prepared in order to study the effect of Fe addition on the microstructures and mechanical properties (tensile strength, yield strength, elongation, and Rockwell C scale hardness) of Ni- and C-free Co-Cr-Mo alloys. Fe was added with the composition of Co-29Cr-6Mo-xFe (where x = 0, 5, 10, and 20). Alloys were heat-treated at 1230 degrees C for 3 h and 1250 degrees C for 5 h. These heat treatment conditions were decided as considering pre-heat treatment followed by hot-forging process. An optical microscope and an XRD were used to determine the microstructure and identify the crystal structure. The volume ratio of gamma phase to epsilon phase increases not only with heat treatment temperature and time but also with Fe content. The tensile strength, yield strength, and elongation are significantly improved by Fe addition. However, the tendency toward a phase formation becomes higher as the Fe content increases, causing a deterioration of mechanical properties. From the viewpoint of mechanical properties, the amount of Fe addition should be less than 10 mass% in pre-heated condition of Co-29Cr-6Mo alloys.

TI The thermal stability of topologically close-packed phases in the
   single-crystal Ni-base superalloy ERBO/1
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB In Ni-base superalloys, the addition of refractory elements such as Cr, Mo, Co, W, and Re is necessary to increase the creep resistance. Nevertheless, these elements induce the formation of different kinds of intermetallic phases, namely, the topologically close-packed (TCP) phases. This work focuses on intermetallic phases present in the second-generation single-crystal (SX) Ni-base superalloy ERBO/1. In the as-cast condition, the typical gamma/gamma' structure is accompanied by undesirable intermetallic phases located in the interdendritic regions. The nature of these precipitates as well as their thermal stability between 800 and 1200 A degrees C has been investigated by isothermal heat treatments. The investigation techniques include DSC, SEM, EDX, and TEM. The experimental information is complemented by (1) comparison with a structure map to link the local chemical composition with phase stability, as well as (2) thermodynamic calculations based on the CALPHAD method to determine the occurrence and composition of phases during solidification and in equilibrium conditions. The TCP phases Laves, A mu and sigma were identified in various temperature/time ranges.

TI Discovery of a thermally persistent h.c.p. solid-solution phase in the
   Ni-W system
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Although the accepted Ni-W phase diagram does not reveal the existence of h.c.p.-based phases, h.c.p.-like stacking sequences were observed in magnetron-co-sputtered Ni-W thin films at W contents of 20 to 25 at. %, by using transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. The occurrence of this h.c.p.-like solid-solution phase could be rationalized by first-principles calculations, showing that the vicinity of the system's ground-state line is populated with metastable h.c.p.-based superstructures in the intermediate concentration range from 20 to 50 at. % W. The h.c.p.-like stacking in Ni-W films was observed to be thermally persistent, up to temperatures as high as at least 850 K, as evidenced by extensive X-ray diffraction analyses on specimens before and after annealing treatments. The tendency of Ni-W for excessive planar faulting is discussed in the light of these new findings. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.

AB The high temperature strength of alloys with (gamma +gamma') microstructure is primarily due to the resistance of the ordered precipitate to cutting by matrix dislocations. Such shearing requires higher stresses since it involves the creation of a planar fault. Planar fault energy is known to be dependent on composition. This implies that the composition on the fault may be different from that in the bulk for energetic reasons. Such segregation (or desegregation) of specific alloying elements to the fault may result in Suzuki strengthening which has not been explored extensively in these systems. In this work, segregation (or desegregation) of alloying elements to planar faults was studied computationally in Ni-3(Al, Ti) and Co-3(W, Al) type gamma' precipitates. The composition dependence of APB energy and heat of mixing were evaluated from first principle electronic structure calculations. A phase field model incorporating the first principles results, was used to simulate the motion of an extended superdislocation under stress concurrently with composition evolution. Results reveal that in both systems, significant (de) segregation occurs on equilibration. On application of stress, solutes were dragged along with the APB in some cases. Additionally, it was also noted the velocity of the superdislocation under an applied stress is strongly dependent on atomic mobility (i. e. diffusivity).

SE Woodhead Publishing in Materials
AB This chapter focuses on the hydrogen environment embrittlement (HEE) effects for three main classes of superalloys known as the nickel-based, cobalt-based and iron-based superalloys. For many superalloys, the HEE effects can occur over a much wider range of temperatures, with significant hydrogen embrittlement still evident at substantially higher temperatures than near room temperature. A comprehensive review of experimental data for HEE index is given, which is a useful concept to qualitatively evaluate the severity of hydrogen embrittlement prior to performing detailed material and fracture analysis for a specific hydrogen environment application. High pressure and temperature effects of hydrogen gas on superalloy properties such as tensile ductility, fracture, low cycle and high cycle fatigue, cyclic crack growth rate, and creep stress rupture have been analyzed with respect to the behavior trends established from the HEE index values. The compositional effects of nickel for hydrogen embrittlement of many Fe-Ni-Cr-based superalloys are also presented.

TI Understanding the effects of recrystallization and strain induced
   boundary migration on Sigma 3 twin boundary formation in Ni-base
   superalloys during iterative sub-solvus annealing
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB The formation of Sigma 3 twin boundaries in an experimental low stacking fault Ni-based superalloy containing 24 wt % Co was investigated. Normalized microstructures were hot deformed to strain limits of 0.10 and 0.50 at a strain rate of 0.1/s and a temperature of 1020 degrees C. The hot-deformed microstructures were characterized using electron backscatter diffraction, and were subsequently subjected to a series of iterative sub-solvus anneal heat treatments at 1100 degrees C for one to two minutes. By characterizing the changes in the microstructure and grain boundary character distribution as a function of annealing time, this investigation sought to quantify and detail how twin boundary generation and growth occurs during annealing. This behavior was investigated in the same alloy, but with two distinct as-deformed starting microstructures associated with the different strain limits. The starting microstructures possessed varying levels of intragranular misorientation networks, which were found to have greatly affected the resultant formation of Sigma 3 annealing twin boundaries. Strain induced boundary migration (SIBM) was observed to have been restricted in the iteratively annealed sample deformed to a strain of 0.10. Due to the sub-solvus heat treat temperature, grain boundary precipitates were present in the microstructure which limited the mobility of the grain boundaries and suppressed grain growth. As a result, the expansion in the length fraction of Sigma 3 twin boundaries was limited as a function of annealing time. The sample deformed to 0.50 strain, however, was shown to have recrystallized both upon deformation and subsequent annealing. Although recrystallization was found to largely remove much of the pre-existing twin boundaries, the mobility of the newly formed boundaries during growth of the recrystallized grains resulted in a dramatic increase in both the density and length fraction of twin boundaries.

AB In order to make clear the mechanism of the directional coarsening (rafting) of gamma' phases in Ni-base superalloys under uni-axial tensile strain, molecular dynamics (MD) analysis Was applied to investigate dominant factors of strain-induced anisotropic diffusion of Al atoms and nanotexture change of fine dispersed gamma' precipitates. In this study, a simple interface structure model corresponding to the gamma/gamma' interface, which consisted of Ni as gamma and Ni3Al as gamma' structure, was used to analyze the effect of alloying element on diffusion properties. The diffusion constants of Al atoms were changed drastically by the dopant elements and their contents. When the lattice constant of the gamma phase was increased and its melting point was decreased by the addition of Cr or Al atoms, the strain-induced anisotropic diffusion of Al atoms in the gamma' phase was accelerated. On the other hand, the addition of Co decreased the diffusion significantly. Therefore, changes of lattice constant and melting point depending on the chemical composition of the gamma/gamma' interface are the dominant factors controlling the strain-induced anisotropic diffusion of Al atoms in the Ni-base superalloy.

SO METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND
   MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB The oxidation behavior of the third-generation nickel-base single-crystal superalloy CMSX-10 is examined. Since the in-service performance of the alloy is of the greatest practical significance, a detailed study is made of the microstructural degradation of a turbine blade that had been removed prematurely from a commercial gas turbine engine. The results are augmented with isothermal oxidation tests conducted in the laboratory for 100 hours, at temperatures of 800 degrees C, 900 degrees C, and 1000 degrees C. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis, microhardness testing, and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were employed. It was found that the oxidation of CMSX-10 at temperatures below 1000 degrees C does not produce either Al2O3 or the spinel Ni(Cr,Al)(2)O-4, both of which are found in the internal oxidation zone of the earlier generations of superalloys. Surprisingly, it is demonstrated conclusively that the oxidation of CMSX-10 generates the beta phase (NiAl). This reaction, which to the authors' knowledge has not yet been reported, is termed self-aluminization. The XRD studies demonstrate that the internal oxidation of CMSX-10 produces (Ni,Co)Ta2O6, (Ni,CO)WO4, CrTaO4, and Cr(W,MO)O-4. There is indication that the formation of the delta phase (Ni2Al3) slows the oxidation rate at 1000 degrees C.

As the temperature decreasing and increasing of the content of Ti in liquid, the morphology of eta changes as follows: granular-->rodlike or lamellar -->blocky. Liquid density calculation shows that the liquid density is reduced with temperature decreasing but slightly arises below 1300 degrees C which is related to the precipitation of high-Ti phase of eta and MC carbides from liquid. The maximum liquid density inversion is up to 0.01406 g-cm(-1)/degrees C and the alloy is prone to macrosegregation of freckles.

TI THE HOT-CORROSION BEHAVIOR OF NOVEL CO-DEPOSITED CHROMIUM-MODIFIED
   ALUMINIDE COATINGS
SO OXIDATION OF METALS
AB This paper reports the successful co-deposition of inclusion-free chromium-modified aluminide coatings using a pack-cementation process. The substrate used was the nickel-base superalloy, Rene 80H. The coatings were of the outward-diffusion type; however, unlike the usual outward-diffusion coatings, the present coatings were relatively free of pack inclusions. The coatings consisted of alpha-Cr precipitates in a matrix of beta-NiAl. The morphology and distribution of the alpha- Cr precipitates could be adjusted to the extent that two types of coating structures could be obtained. The Type I coating structure contained lamellar alpha- Cr precipitates situated in the surface region of the coating, whereas the Type II coating structure contained small, spheroidal alpha-Cr precipitates distributed throughout the outer of a two-layered coating. Both coating types exhibited significantly improved hot-corrosion resistance in a 0.1% SO2-O2 environment at 900-degrees-C compared to a commercial aluminide coalting. A study of the corrosion behavior of Type I coatings containing pack inclusions showed that the inclusions were deleterious to the corrosion resistance of the coatings. The corrosion behavior of chromium-aluminide coatings was dependent on both the distribution and amount of alpha-Cr precipitates in the coating.

TI Halo Formation During Solidification of Refractory Metal Aluminide
   Ternary Systems
SO METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND
   MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB The evolution of eutectic morphologies following primary solidification has been studied in the refractory metal aluminide (Ta-Al-Fe, Nb-Al-Co, and Nb-Al-Fe) ternary systems. The undercooling accompanying solid growth, as related to the extended solute solubility in the primary and secondary phases can be used to account for the evolution of phase morphologies during ternary eutectic solidification. For small undercooling, the conditions of interfacial equilibrium remain valid, while in the case of significant undercooling when nucleation constraints occur, there is a departure from equilibrium leading to unexpected phases. In Ta-Al-Fe, an extended solubility of Fe in sigma was observed, which was consistent with the formation of a halo of mu phase on primary sigma. In Nb-Al-Co, a halo of C14 is formed on primary CoAl, but very limited vice versa. However, in the absence of a solidus projection it was not possible to definitively determine the extended solute solubility in the primary phase. In Nb-Al-Fe when nucleation constraints arise, the inability to initiate coupled growth of NbAl3 + C14 leads to the occurrence of a two-phase halo of C14 + Nb2Al, indicating a large undercooling and departure from equilibrium.

TI Oxidation Behavior of the Niobium-Modified MAR-M247 Superalloy at 1,000
   A degrees C in Air
SO OXIDATION OF METALS
AB MAR-M247 superalloy has excellent mechanical properties and oxidation resistance. The aim of this work was to evaluate the oxidation behavior of a Nb-modified MAR-M247 superalloy (10.2 wt% Co; 10.2 W; 8.5 Cr; 5.6 Al; 1.6 Nb; 1.4 Hf; 1.1 Ti; 0.7 Mo; 0.15 C; 0.06 Zr; 0.02 B; Ni balance). The samples were subjected to oxidation tests in air at 1,000 A degrees C up to 240 h and the weight gain was measured every 24 h. The material in the as-cast condition as well as those from the oxidation tests were characterized with the aid of SEM/EDS and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The results showed that the n value and the parabolic rate constant (k) for the MAR-M247(Nb) superalloy at 1,000 A degrees C were about 0.1 and 2.8 x 10(-8) mg(2)cm(-4)s(-1), respectively. The microstructural characterization showed the formation of NiO oxides in the outer layer, Cr2O3, TiO2, CoO, (Ni,Co)Cr2O4 spinels, W20O58 and HfO2 particles in the intermediate layer and Al2O3 in the inner layer and in the gamma' depleted zone of the material.

AB HAYNES((R)) 233 alloy based on the Ni-Co-Cr-Mo-Al system has been developed for service at high temperatures. The origins of 233 alloy can be traced to a couple of Haynes alloys: 230 alloy and 214 alloy. The former is a premier high-temperature alloy with superb creep strength and is widely accepted in the gas turbine industry. It is also chromia forming. The alumina-forming 214 alloy with its 4.5% Al content possesses outstanding oxidation resistance at high temperatures, but its creep strength above similar to 1800 degrees F (982 degrees C) is very poor. The new 233 alloy attempts to bridge this performance. This paper will present preliminary test results for 233 alloy from the products of the first production heats, including the tensile and creep properties of the alloy, microstructure, oxidation properties, as well as fabricability. These results will be compared and discussed with those of popular gas turbine alloys such as 230, 214, 617, and X alloys. The preliminary test results indicate that HAYNES 233 alloy has a unique combination of excellent oxidation resistance and creep-rupture strength while at the same time being readily fabricable. These properties make the alloy an attractive candidate for a wide variety of gas turbine and other high-temperature applications.

TI A Kinetic Model for Grain Growth in a Polycrystalline Ni-Co Base
   Superalloy with gamma/gamma Two-Phase
SO JOURNAL OF THE JAPAN INSTITUTE OF METALS
AB Grain growth kinetics was studied in a new Ni-Co base disk superalloy with gamma/gamma two-phase structure (TMW-4M3) The alloy was heat-treated from 1100 to 1160 C for up to 100 h after hot-deformation The results indicated that the size of un-dissolved gamma -phase increased with increasing of temperature or time because of Ostwald ripening Meanwhile the grain size of the alloy showed a good agreement with the Zener s pinning model at all tested conditions which means that the grain size can be estimated from the size and the volume fraction of the un-dissolved gamma -phase particles Furthermore assuming that the coarsening behavior of the pinning gamma particles follows Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner (LSW) theory we estimate that the activation energy of the gamma particle growth in TMW-4M3 is 303 +/- 28 kJ/mol (within the gamma sub-solvus temperature range from 1100 to 1150 C) which is close to that of diffusion of Al and Ti atoms in the matrix Therefore we suggest that the grain growth in TMW-4M3 follows the diffusion-controlled growth model of gamma formers in the matrix and the grain growth rate is determined by the coarsening rate of un-dissolved gamma -phase particles

TI Oxidation Behavior of Selected Bond Coats Based on the gamma' plus gamma
   Structure and Their Performance in Thermal Barrier Coatings Deposited on
   a Nickel-Based Superalloy
SO OXIDATION OF METALS
AB Three bond coats based on the gamma'-Ni3Al + gamma-Ni microstructure were developed by diffusing pairs of Pt layers and metallic layers with selected compositions into a Ni-based superalloy. Thermal exposure tests at 1,150 A degrees C with 24-h cycling period to room temperature were used to evaluate the thermal stability and oxidation behavior of the bond coats as well as their performance in thermal barrier coating systems utilizing zirconia-7 wt% yttria as the top coat. It is shown that a bond coat developed by a Pt layer and a layer of Ni-6 wt% Re-0.5 wt% Y alloy outperforms the conventional gamma' + gamma Pt bond coats by more than two folds. Most evidence points out that the proper concentrations of Re and Y in the presence of balanced concentrations of other elements, particularly Al, Ti, Cr and Co can significantly enhance the thermal stability and oxidation resistance of gamma' + gamma Pt bond coats.

SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB The principle failure mechanism in thixoforming dies is thermal fatigue as the mechanical loading on the tooling is modest owing to a mushy feedstock. Samples of X32CrMoV33 steel, Inconel 617 and Stellite 6 alloys were submitted to thermal cycling under conditions which approximate thixoforming of steels. The thermal fatigue test of the X32CrMoV33 hot work tool steel was terminated after 1500 cycles due to severe surface degradation and temper softening, both leading to a relatively poor thermal fatigue resistance, in spite of favorable thermo-physical properties. The response to thermal cycling of the Ni- and Co-based superalloys, Inconel 617 and Stellite 6, under steel thixoforming conditions, on the other hand, was encouraging. The Inconel 617 and Stellite 6 samples are much more resistant to oxidation and temper softening than the hot work tool steel, providing a superior resistance to thermal fatigue cracking with few and relatively shallow cracks after as many as 5000 thermal cycles.

AB Both aviation and land based turbine components such as vanes/nozzles, combustion chambers, liners, and transition pieces often degrade and crack in service. Rather than replacing with new components, innovative repairs can help reduce overhaul and maintenance costs. These components are cast from either Co-based solid solution superalloys such as FSX-414, or Ni-based gamma prime precipitation strengthened superalloys such as IN738. The nominal compositions of FSX-414 and IN738 are Co-29.5Cr-10.5N1-7W-2Fe [max]-0.25C-0.012B and Ni-0.001B -0.17C-8.5Co-16Cr-1.7Mo-3.4Al-2.6W-1.7Ta-2Nb-3.4Ti-0.1Zr, respectively.
   Diffusion brazing has been used for over four decades to repair cracks and degradation on these types of components. Typically, braze materials utilized for component repairs are Ni and Co-based braze fillers containing B and/or Si as melting point depressants. Especially when repairing wide cracks typically found on industrial gas turbine components, these melting point depressants can form brittle intermetallic boride and silicide phases that effect mechanical properties such as low cycle and thermal fatigue. The objective of this work is to investigate and evaluate the use of hyper-eutectic Ni-Cr-Hf and Ni-Cr-Zr braze filler metals, where the melting point depressant is no longer B, but Hf and/or Zr. Typically, with joint gaps or crack widths less than 0.15mm, the braze filler metal alone can be utilized. For cracks greater than 0.15mm, a superalloy powder is mixed with the braze filler metal to enable wide cracks to be successfully braze repaired. As a means of qualifying the diffusion braze repair, both metallurgical and mechanical property evaluations were carried out. The metallurgical evaluation consisted of optical and scanning electron microscopy, and microprobe analysis. The diffusion brazed area consisted of a fine-grained equiaxed structure, with carbide phases, gamma [gamma] dendrites, flower shaped/rosette gamma-gamma' [gamma-gamma prime] eutectic phases and Ni(7)Hf(2), Ni(5)HF, or Ni(5)Zr intermetallic phases dispersed both intergranularly and intragranularly. Hardness tests showed that the Ni-Hf and Ni-Zr intermetallic phase only has a hardness range of 250Hv to 400Hv; whereas, the typical Cr-boride phases have hardness ranges from 800Hv to 1000Hv Therefore the hardness values of the Ni-Hf and Ni-Zr intermetallic phases are 2.5-3.2 times softer than the Cr-boride intermetallic phases. As a result the LCF properties of the wide gap Ni-Cr-Hf and Ni-Cr-Zr brazed joints are superior to those of the Ni-Cr-B braze filler metals. The mechanical property evaluations were tensile tests at both room temperature and elevated temperature, stress rupture tests from 760 degrees C-1093 degrees C and finally low cycle fatigue [LCF] tests, the latter being one of the most important and severe tests to conduct, since the cracks being repaired are thermal fatigue driven. At the optimum braze thermal cycle, the mechanical test results achieved were a minimum of 80% and sometimes equivalent to that of the base metals properties.

TI Isothermal Oxidation of Aluminized Coatings on High-Entropy Alloys
SO ENTROPY
AB The isothermal oxidation resistance of Al0.2Co1.5CrFeNi1.5Ti0.3 high-entropy alloy is analyzed and the microstructural evolution of the oxide layer is studied. The limited aluminum, about 3.6 at %, leads to the non-continuous alumina. The present alloy is insufficient for severe circumstances only due to chromium oxide that is 10 mu m after 1173 K for 360 h. Thus, the aluminized high-entropy alloys (HEAs) are further prepared by the industrial packing cementation process at 1273 K and 1323 K. The aluminizing coating is 50 mu m at 1273 K after 5 h. The coating growth is controlled by the diffusion of aluminum. The interdiffusion zone reveals two regions that are the Ti-, Co-, Ni-rich area and the Fe-, Cr-rich area. The oxidation resistance of aluminizing HEA improves outstandingly, and sustains at 1173 K and 1273 K for 441 h without any spallation. The alumina at the surface and the stable interface contribute to the performance of this Al0.2Co1.5CrFeNi1.5Ti0.3 alloy.

TI On the microtwinning mechanism in a single crystal superalloy
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB The contribution of a microtwinning mechanism to the creep deformation behaviour of single crystal superalloy MD2 is studied. Microtwinning is prevalent for uniaxial loading along (011) at 800 degrees C for the stress range 625 to 675 MPa and 825 degrees C for 625 MPa. Using quantitative stereology, the twin fraction and twin thickness are estimated; this allows the accumulated creep strain to be recovered, in turn supporting the role of the microtwinning mode in conferring deformation. Atom probe tomography confirms the segregation of Cr and Co at the twin/parent interface, consistent with the lowering of the stacking fault energy needed to support twin lengthening and thickening. A model for diffusion controlled growth of twins is proposed and it is used to recover the measured creep strain rate. The work provides the basis for a thermo-mechanical constitutive model of deformation consistent with the microtwinning mechanism. (C) 2017 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The contributions of multiple strengthening factors to the 0.2% flow stress have been studied in a cast and wrought Ni-Co base disk superalloy with varying grain size, twin fraction and bimodal or trimodal gamma' size distributions. The alloy was heat-treated within the gamma' sub- and super-solvus temperature ranges between 1100 degrees C to 1180 degrees C, followed by two step aging heat-treatment. The contribution of each strengthening factor are analyzed by measuring its Vickers hardness at over a structural scale ranging from nano to micro levels and then by converting the hardness differences to the contribution to the 0.2% flow stress on the basis of the empirical relation: sigma(0.2)=2.46Hv. The results clearly show that the contribution of grain boundary strengthening decreased and reached zero with increasing solution temperature. The behavior followed Hall-Petch effect and Zener's pinning model, and strongly depended on the size and volume fraction of pinning primary gamma' that is un-dissolved during solution treatment. Meanwhile, the contributions of secondary and tertiary gamma' precipitation strengthening increased with increasing temperature. The behaviors also strongly depend on the volume fraction of the primary gamma' since the designed total volume fraction of gamma' of the alloy is approximately 0.5. As a result, the combinations of these strengthening factors lead to the maximum flow stress at solution temperature of 1135 degrees C. This would suggest that the primary gamma' plays an important role to optimize the microstructure combination through the solution heat-treatment.

   entropy alloy
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB The paper reports evolution of two-phase microstructure quantitatively in a high entropy alloy of composition Co37.6Ni35.4Al9.9Mo4.9Ta2.8Ti3.5. A very high-volume fraction of ordered L1(2) precipitates forms below its solvus temperature of 1156 degrees C that cannot be suppressed during quenching. The quench microstructure contains nanometric bimodal size distribution of spheroidal and irregular precipitates, both having L1(2) ordering (gamma') and a Co + Ni concentration close to 75 at. %, thus representing a stoichiometry of (Ni,Co)(3) (AI,Cr,Ta,Ti,Mo). The alloy shows hardening on aging with a peak in hardness value at 900 degrees C for 50 h of annealing. The morphology of the precipitates at this stage evolves into cuboidal shape having rounded corners with a lattice mismatch of +0.22% with the matrix. A detailed study of the coarsening behaviour of these precipitates in the matrix of complex solid solution indicates that the coarsening follows a modified LSW mechanism with estimated activation energy of 360 +/- 50 kJ/mol between 900 and 1000 degrees C. This is slightly higher than the activation energy of most of the solutes in gamma Co matrix that does not contain heavy elements like W or Re. The high-volume fraction of the precipitates together with coarsening resistance lead to an attractive high temperature strength that is higher than many of the known superalloys.

TI Modeling Dislocation Network and Dislocation-Precipitate Interaction at

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR MULTISCALE COMPUTATIONAL ENGINEERING
AB In this article we discuss phase field modeling of dislocation reactions and network formation in fa crystals, gamma-channel filling by dislocations during plastic deformation in Ni-based superalloys, and deformation mechanisms in multilayer thin films. The phase field method is introduced in the context of gradient thermodynamics and discussed in contrast to the Peierls-Nabarro model. General expressions of crystalline and gradient energies are introduced, and their applications to various dislocation reactions leading to network formation are presented. The critical shear stress applied to drive dislocations through the gamma-channels is characterized as a function of channel width, dislocation density in the channels, and lattice mismatch. The propagation behavior of threading dislocations in a multilayer microstructure is characterized as a function of misfit strain and applied stress. Different deformation mechanisms of the multilayer microstructure are predicted, ranging from a confined layer slip in individual layers at a large lattice mismatch to a co-deformation across layers at a smaller lattice mismatch. Advantages, potential new applications, and limitations of the phase field method are discussed.

AB A novel method for diffusion bonding metallic alloys with stable surface oxide films (e.g. nickel and cobalt base superalloys and aluminium. alloys) has been developed. The stable oxides on the faying surfaces of these alloys are replaced, prior to the bonding process, with a very thin metallic layer and/or less stable oxides, using a proprietary non-chemical oxide removal method based on the use of gallium. This new method is very rapid and neither requires the use of any sophisticated equipment nor is a costly process. Bonding is then readily achieved by either solid-state or transient-liquid-phase (TLP) diffusion bonding. Using this method, bonds in nickel-base and cobalt-base superalloys with "virtually invisible" bond interfaces and bonds in aluminium alloys with strengths as high as those of the parent alloys can be produced.

AB Both aviation and land based turbine components such as vanes/nozzles, combustion chambers, liners, and transition pieces often degrade and crack in service. Rather than replacing with new components, innovative repairs can help reduce overhaul and maintenance costs. These components are cast from either Co-based solid solution superalloys such as FSX-414, or Ni-based gamma prime precipitation strengthened superalloys such as IN738. The nominal compositions of FSX-414 and IN738 are Co-29.5Cr-10.5Ni-7W-2Fe [max]-0.25C-0.012B and Ni-0.001B -0.17C-8.5Co-16Cr-1.7Mo-3.4Al-2.6W-1.7Ta-2Nb-3.4Ti-0.1Zr, respectively.
   Diffusion brazing has been used for over four decades to repair cracks and degradation on these types of components. Typically, braze materials utilized for component repairs are Ni and Co-based braze fillers containing B and/or Si as melting point depressants. Especially when repairing wide cracks typically found on industrial gas turbine components, these melting point depressants can form brittle intermetallic boride and silicide phases that effect mechanical properties such as low cycle and thermal fatigue. The objective of this work is to investigate and evaluate the use of hyper-eutectic Ni-Cr-Hf and Ni-Cr-Zr braze filler metals, where the melting point depressant is no longer B, but Hf and/or Zr. Typically, With joint gaps or crack widths less than 0.15mm, the braze filler metal alone can be utilized. For cracks greater than 0.15mm, a superalloy powder is mixed with the braze filler metal to enable wide cracks to be successfully brazed repaired. As a means of qualifying the diffusion braze repair, both metallurgical and mechanical property evaluations were carried out. The metallurgical evaluation consisted of optical and scanning electron microscopy, and microprobe analysis. The diffusion brazed area consisted of a fine-grained equiaxed structure, with carbide phases, gamma [gamma] dendrites, flower shaped/rosette gamma-gamma' [gamma-gamma prime] eutectic phases and Ni(7)Hf(2), Ni(5)HF, or Ni(5)Zr intermetallic phases dispersed both intergranularly and intragranularly. Hardness tests showed that the Ni-Hf and Ni-Zr intermetallic phase only has a hardness range of 250Hv to 400Hv; whereas, the typical Cr-boride phases have hardness ranges from 800Hv to 1000Hv. Therefore the hardness values of the Ni-HF and Ni-Zr intermetallic phases are 2.5-3.2 times softer than the Cr-boride intermetallic phases. As a result the LCF properties of the wide gap Ni-Cr-Hf and Ni-Cr-Zr brazed joints are superior to those of the Ni-Cr-B braze filler metals. The mechanical property evaluations were tensile tests at both room temperature and elevated temperature, stress rupture tests from 760 degrees C-1093 degrees C and finally low cycle fatigue [LCF] tests, the latter being one of the most important and severe tests to conduct, since the cracks being repaired are thermal fatigue driven. At the optimum braze thermal cycle; the mechanical test results achieved were a minimum of 80% and sometimes equivalent to that of the base metals properties.

TI On the crystallography and composition of topologically close-packed
   phases in ATI 718Plus (R)
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB ATI 718Pluse (R) is a nickel-based superalloy developed to replace Inconel 718 in aero engines for static and rotating applications. Here, the long-term stability of the alloy was studied and it was found that topologically close-packed (TCP) phases can form at the gamma-eta interface or, less frequently, at grain boundaries. Conventional and scanning transmission electron microscopy techniques were applied to elucidate the crystal structure and composition of these TCP precipitates. The precipitates were found to be tetragonal sigma phase and hexagonal C14 Laves phase, both being enriched in Cr, Co, Fe and Mo though sigma has a higher Cr and lower Nb content. The precipitates were observed to be heavily faulted along multiple planes. In addition, the disorientations between the TCP phases and neighbouring eta/gamma were determined using scanning precession electron diffraction and evaluated in axis-angle space. This work therefore provides a series of compositional and crystallographic insights that may be used to guide future alloy design. (C) 2017 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Inconel alloys are currently being investigated for high temperature applications such as HP and IP valve chest and rotor forgings in advanced steam power plant operating at temperatures of 700 degrees C and above. One of the preferred alloys for these components is IN617. This is a solid solution strengthened austenitic Ni-based alloy containing similar to 23% Cr, 12% Co, and 9% Mo with small additions of Ti and Al which can contribute some additional precipitation strengthening. In the solution treated condition, the microstructure consists of equiaxed austenite containing M(23)C(6) at the grain boundaries and occasional TiN particles within the matrix. Owing to high temperature exposure and the creep deformation processes that occur in-service, evolution of the microstructure occurs in the form of precipitation, precipitate coarsening and recovery effects. This paper discusses microstructural evolution occurring in this alloy in samples that have been exposed to temperatures up to 700 degrees C and for durations up to 45,000 hours using advanced FEGSEM, TEM and XRD techniques.

TI Stability of nanoscale co-precipitates in a superalloy: A combined
   first-principles and atom probe tomography study
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Inconel 718 is a nickel-iron based superalloy widely used in the aerospace industry. Its high temperature strength is attributed to the thermal stability of dense nanoscale precipitates gamma' [Ni3Al] and gamma '' [Ni3Nb]. There is experimental evidence that gamma' and gamma '' often form co-precipitates gamma'/gamma '' or sandwichlike structure gamma'/gamma ''/gamma' or gamma ''/gamma'/gamma ''. But how they stabilize under heat treatment or in service is still not well-understood. We have investigated the interfacial structure and chemistry of fine co-precipitates Ni-3(Al, Ti, Nb)/Ni3Nb(gamma'/gamma '') in Inconel 718, using both first-principles density functional theory calculation and the three-dimensional atom probe technique. Our calculations confirm that Al atoms in the gamma' phase segregate to the gamma'/gamma '' interface. The enrichment of Al helps to impede the assimilation of Nb from gamma' to gamma '' and reject Al from gamma '' to gamma', and therefore keeps such secondary precipitates at fine size. In the absence of Ti in the gamma' phase, our calculations predict an enhanced driving force for Al to accumulate at the interface. We have also characterized the microstructure of the gamma'/gamma '' interface for an Inconel 718 sample taken from a commercial compressor blade serviced in an airplane engine for over 10 000 h at a temperature up to 600 degrees C using three-dimensional atom probe analysis. Interestingly, we find that Al enrichment sustains long-term service, suggesting that the coarsening of secondary precipitates is interface-controlled. The success of first-principles density functional theory computation in reproducing the experimental observation encourages extensive application of this powerful tool in the study of precipitates in superalloys.

AB In the present study, three superalloys viz. Superni 718, Superni 600 and Superco 605 were hung inside the secondary chamber of actual medical waste incinerator where the temperature is more than 1050 degrees C. Burning of medical waste produces very corrosive environment at high temperature which can degrade the components of construction. Hence the three superalloys were kept for 1000 h inside the chamber. Corrosion rate has been calculated in mpy. Corrosion products so produced were characterized using SEM/EDS and XRD technique. It was observed that both the Nickel based superalloys showed better corrosion resistance than the cobalt based superalloy under the given environment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Effects of alloying elements on elastic properties of Ni by
   first-principles calculations
SO COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB The effects of alloying elements (Al, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hf, Mo, Nb, Pt, Re, Ta, Ti, W, Y and Zr) on the elastic constants (c(ij)'s) of Ni have been investigated using first-principles calculations within the generalized gradient approximation. The results are compared with the available experimental data and analyzed based on the volume changes and electron density. It is found that the shear modulus decreases with increasing volume caused by alloying addition and the bulk modulus (B) is related to the total molar volume (V-m) and electron density (n) with the relationship, n proportional to root B/V-m. The melting temperatures of Ni-X dilute solutions calculated from the available thermodynamic databases have been compared to those obtained from the empirical relationship with the elastic constant c(11). The calculated elastic constants show good relationships with the mechanical properties such as 0.2% flow stress and give us a guideline to understand and develop Ni-based superalloys.

TI Plasma assisted milling of heat-resistant superalloys
SO JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE
   ASME
AB The term Thermal Enhanced Machining refers to a conventional cutting process in which an external energy source is used to enhance the chip-generation mechanism. The work presented here analyzes the basic aspects and the experimental results obtained when applying an assisting plasma jet to the milling process. This process, known as PAM (Plasma Assisted Milling) has been applied to the machining of three very low machinability materials: a Ni-base alloy (Inconel 718), a Co-base alloy (Haynes 25), (both belonging to the group of the heat-resistant alloys) and the Ti-base alloy Ti6Al4V The study focuses on two major topics. First, the efficiency of the milling operation in terms of cutting speed, feed, axial and radial depths of cut and the plasma operating parameters has been addressed. Second, a study on the alterations of the metallurgical structure and the properties of materials after the PAM has also been performed. The process conditions for the above-mentioned Ni-base and Co-base alloys are detailed. The study under these conditions has shown an excellent performance of the whisker reinforced ceramic tools. In fact, cutting speeds as high as 970 m/min and large radial and axial depths of cuts are possible, driving to a cost-effective machining process. The absence of changes in the metallurgical structure of the alloys after applying the PAM process is also addressed. Therefore, it can be stated that this is a feasible approach to the optimization of the machining process of heat-resistant alloys.. Finally, the results obtained in the PAM of Ti6Al4V are detailed. In this experimentation, a certain level of degradation was observed in the microstructure of the alloy when undergoing the PAM process, therefore the use of this technique is not recommended for this material.

TI Kinetics pathway of precipitation in model Co-Al-W superalloy
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB The early stages of precipitation of the gamma' phase in a model Co based superalloy (Co-9.1Al-7W (at.%)) have been investigated at 900 degrees C using electron microscopy and atom probe tomography. Nucleation, growth and coarsening stages have been studied with a focus on the temporal evolution of the precipitate composition in the light of recent theoretical developments on phase separation in multicomponent alloys. The experimental data have been confronted to the theories of nucleation and coarsening recently developed for such alloys, which are valid for non-ideal and non-dilute systems, and predict the temporal evolution of both the matrix and precipitate compositions. The rate constant for the mean size evolution of the particles, as derived from experiments, has been compared to the one predicted by the mentioned coarsening theory that accounts for a more accurate description of the thermodynamics of the phases, as compared with more classical approaches. From this comparison the gamma/gamma' interfacial energy was derived and found equal to similar to 48 mJ/m(2) The exponents for the temporal evolution of average particles size, number of particles per unit volume were found identical to those for binary alloys during the coarsening regime, as expected, and the temporal evolutions of compositions in both gamma and gamma' phases were found to evolve as predicted by theory. Indeed, the W content in the particles, measured from atom probe tomography (APT) experiments, was found to significantly decrease with time and the observed evolution is remarkably well described by the theory and therefore is shown to originate from the competition between diffusion and capillarity.

TI Effect of Directional Solidification Variables on the Microstructures of
   Single-Crystal Turbine Blades of Nickel-Based Superalloy
SO ADVANCED ENGINEERING MATERIALS
AB Single-crystal turbine blades of nickel-based superalloy are directionally solidified at different withdrawal rates of 0.0017 cm s(-1)-0.01 cm s(-1) aiming to investigate the evolution of as-cast microstructures. The results show that the average primary and secondary dendrite arm spacings,.1 and.2, decrease with increasing withdrawal rate, although the complicated geometry of the blades results in local nonhomogeneity of dendrite arm spacings. The experimentally achieved values of.1 can be reasonably predicted by Ma and Sahm's theoretical model, in which the effect of the secondary dendrite on the primary dendrite arm spacing is considered. With increasing withdrawal rate, the shape of the g/ g0 eutectic varies from a large block-like eutectic island to an interconnected small strip-like morphology. In addition to this, the average size of the g/ g0 eutectic gradually decreases with increasing withdrawal rate. A reduction in the average sizes of the g0 precipitates in the dendrite core and interdendritic region is also observed with increasing withdrawal rate. The microsegregation levels of Al, Ti, Ta, Cr, Co, and Mo are alleviated with increasing withdrawal rate.

TI Interfacial dislocation networks and creep in directional coarsened
   ru-containing nickel-base single-crystal superalloys
SO METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND
   MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Mechanisms of creep deformation in nickel-base superalloy single crystals in the directional coarsening regime have been studied in alloys with large variations in gamma-gamma ' lattice misfit and phase composition, achieved by Ru additions and variable levels of Cr and Co. Interfacial dislocation spacings established by long-term annealing experiments under no externally applied stress indicate that the experimental alloys have high-temperature lattice misfits ranging from near-zero to as large as -0.65 pct. Variation in misfit influences the stress-induced directional coarsening (rafting) behavior during creep deformation at 950 circle C and 290 MPa. In postcreep deformed material, the density of excess dislocations (defined as the dislocations beyond those necessary to relieve the lattice misfit) at the gamma-gamma degrees interfaces varied with alloy composition, with the most creep-resistant, alloy containing the highest excess interfacial dislocation density. In the directional coarsening creep regime, continued deformation requires shearing of the gamma ' rafts and is strongly influenced by the resistance of the precipitates to shearing as well as the interfacial dislocation structure. A preliminary model for creep in the rafting regime is developed.

TI Modelling of composition and phase changes in multiphase alloys due to
   growth of an oxide layer
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB A coupled thermodynamic-kinetic oxidation model is presented for the selective, external oxidation of the most reactive alloy constituent of a multicomponent multiphase alloy. The model computes the composition depth profiles of the alloy constituents in the alloy as well as the evolution in the phase fractions in the alloy as function of oxidation time. The applicability of the model is illustrated through several examples. For the isothermal and cyclic oxidation of single- and two-phase binary alloys excellent agreement was obtained between the numerical calculations and the corresponding analytical solutions. For the isothermal oxidation of two gamma+beta NiCrAl alloys with different initial volume fractions of the 0 phase, very good agreement was obtained between experimentally and calculated composition depth profiles. Finally, the effect of alloying additions on the phase evolution in the alloy was studied for the isothermal oxidation of freestanding MCrAlY (M = Ni, Co) coatings. It is shown that for a similar bulk Al and Cr content in the coating, the concentration profiles of Al in the coating after oxidation can be significantly affected by alloying with elements like Co, Ta and Re. Consequently, the multicomponent and multiphase character of the MCrAlY coating has to be taken into account when performing lifetime studies. (C) 2008 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Fatigue crack growth behavior of a newly developed Ni-Co-base superalloy
   TMW-2 at elevated temperatures
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB Fatigue crack growth (FCG) rates of a new superalloy TMW-2 in air was studied by a fracture mechanics test method. Compact tension specimens were tested under load control with a triangular wave form to investigate the effects of temperature (400, 650, and 725 degrees C) and load ratio (0.05 and 0.5) on FCG rates. The results showed that the FCG rates increased significantly with increasing the temperature. Compared with the creep effects, the results showed that the degradation of mechanical properties and the oxidation assisted crack growth may dominate the FCG rates of TMW-2 at elevated temperatures. Load ratio had a little (at 400 degrees C) or moderate (at 650 and 725 degrees C) influence on the FCG rates, which increased as the load ratio increased. The load ratio effects were successfully accounted for by applying the Walker model. The fractographic observations showed that the fracture mode was transgranular at 400 degrees C and was mixed transgranular and intergranular at 650 and 725 degrees C. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

TI STUDY ON PARTITION RATIO AND SEGREGATION BEHAVIOR OF DZ125 ALLOY DURING
   DIRECTIONAL SOLIDIFICATION
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB Segregation behavior is an important problem in solidification process of alloys, which determines their growth morphologies, phase distributions and concentration segregations so that it affects the mechanical properties of alloys, such as fatigue lives, creep properies, etc.. However, the segregation behaviors of Ni-based superalloys are very complex that contain multi-components and consist of multi-phases. The solute partition coefficient is a key characteristic parameter to express the solute segregation level and tendency in a solidification process. In the present paper, the solute profiles in directionally solidified DZ125 alloy with planar interface growth, which was obtained through experiments of quenching during directional solidification, have been measured by electron probe micro analysis (EPMA). The steady state of solute redistribution hardly reaches due to melt flow during solidification process. The contents of gamma' phase forming elements, Al, Ti, Ta, Mo and Ni, along longitudinal direction increase with the increase of solidified fraction, while those of W, Cr and Co decrease. The results show that the solute partition coefficients of Al, Ti, Ta, Mo and Ni are less than unit, those of W, Cr and Co are more than unit. In addition, the solute distribution in solid phase with dendrite growth is similar to that with planar interface growth. Compared the experimental results of microsegregation with the calculated ones of Scheil model and Brody-Flemings model, the Brody-Flemings model fits better with the experimental results. It indicates that the back-diffusion in solid phase would reduce the microsegregation during dendrite growth.

AB The paper presents the results of ATD thermal analysis of feed ingots (master heat) and castings made from IN-713C, MAR-247 and MAR-509 superalloys. Metallurgical quality assessment was made based on the analysis of dT/dt curve in rage from T-eut to T-sol. Furthermore, impurities (oxides of Al, Zr, Hf, Cr etc.) have been identified inside the shrinkage cavities of feed ingots and castings. Significant similarities has been observed between impurities found in ingots, ATD test samples and finished castings. It has been demonstrated that ATD analysis of samples taken from different parts of feed ingot can be effective method of metallurgical quality assessment for these ingots.

AB One type of functionally graded coating system is thermal barrier coating (TBC), where the combination of ceramic and metallic coating is used both to reduce the temperature and to increase oxidation and corrosion resistance of the substrate. TBCs usually consist of the top ceramic coating based on YSZ (ZrO2+Y2O3) and the metallic bond coating of M-CrAlY type, where M means Ni, Co or their appropriate combination. Electron beam physical vapour deposition (EB-PVD) or vacuum (VPS), low pressure (LPPS) or atmospheric (APS) plasma spraying techniques are most frequently used as a deposition method. Despite some requirements on the product shape simplicity, the air plasma spraying offers high productivity, sufficient quality and much lower production costs in comparison with the EB-PVD technology. The contribution deals with high temperature structural stability of TBCs of YSZ + NiCrAlY and YSZ + CoNiCrAlY types that were produced by air plasma spraying on the INCONEL 713LC polycrystalline nickel based superalloy substrate. Immediately after deposition, the specimens were exposed to temperature of 1000 C for 5-500 hours in the common ambient atmosphere. The changes in both microstructure and chemical composition were studied by means of scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive microanalysis and image analysis methods.

TI Integrated modeling of molar volume of the sigma phase aided by
   first-principles calculations
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB The volume modeling of the sigma phase is an indispensable complement to the integrated computational material design of technologically important materials, such as high-alloy steels and Ni-based superalloys. The molar volume of the sigma phase is influenced by both the atomic mixing (the volume variation affected by this factor is caused by composition alteration rather than site occupation change) and atomic order (i.e. atomic constituent distribution or site occupancy preference on inequivalent sites of a crystal). In the present work, we developed a new integrated thermodynamic and molar volume model to consider physically both mixing and order factors. The integrated model was built within the compound energy formalism (CEF), enabling the thermodynamic calculations to determine equilibrium site occupancies for the subsequent volume calculations. The model parameters of the CEF were assigned by using the first-principles calculated energies and molar volumes of the complete sets of ordered configurations of the sigma phase, as well as the extrapolated molar volumes of the pure elements in the hypothetic sigma phase structure. Such extrapolation for pure elements is based on the experimental data from the literature and the first-principles calculations. We applied the integrated model to study the binary compounds, e.g. Cr-Co, Cr-Fe, Cr-Mn, Mo-Fe, Mo-Mn, Mo-Re, Re-Cr, Re-Fe, Re-Mn, Nb-Al, Ta-Al, V-Fe, V-Ni, and ternary compounds Cr-Fe-X (X= Co and Ni). The integrated thermodynamic and molar volume databases can predict successfully the molar volume of the binary and ternary sigma compounds. As most experimental volume data were measured at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, and the first-principles calculations were performed at 0 K, the present model parameters are valid at about room temperature and atmospheric pressure.

TI Oxidation behavior and mechanism of a Ni-based single crystal superalloy
   with single alpha-Al2O3 film at 1000 degrees C
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB Detailed long-term of 2000 h oxidation behavior of a Ni-based single crystal superalloy was investigated at 1000 degrees C. In the first oxidation stage, alpha-Al2O3 formed immediately, and then the mass gain curve obeys the parabolic law, which corresponds to the growth of alpha-Al2O3 film. A single alpha-Al2O3 film kept on the surface of the specimen before 750 h oxidation. The oxidation is controlled by the inward diffusion of oxygen anions to react with Al cations at the oxide/metal interface. The shape of the exfoliation region of single alpha-Al2O3 film is closed to an annulus, in which the (Ni, Co)O layer formed due to depletion of Al. The three-layer oxide scale formed rapidly after 750 h oxidation. With the continue consumption of Al, a discontinuous inner alpha-Al2O3 layer formed, making oxide scale spall seriously and gain mass rapidly. The states of alpha-Al2O3 film, the controlled film, are different in dendrite core and interdendritic region. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Advanced Scale Bridging Microstructure Analysis of Single Crystal
   Ni-Base Superalloys
SO ADVANCED ENGINEERING MATERIALS
AB In the present work, we show how conventional and advanced mechanical, chemical, and microstructural methods can be used to characterize cast single crystal Ni-base superalloy (SX) plates across multiple length scales. Two types of microstructural heterogeneities are important, associated with the castmicrostructure (dendrites (D) and interdendritic (ID) regions - large scale heterogeneity) and with the well-known gamma/gamma' microstructure (small scale heterogeneity). Using electron probe microanalysis (EPMA), we can show that elements such as Re, Co, and Cr partition to the dendrites while ID regions contain more Al, Ta, and Ti. Analytical transmission electron microscopy and atom probe tomography (APT) show that Al, Ta, and Ti partition to the gamma' cubes while gamma channels show higher concentrations of Co, Cr, Re, and W. We can combine large scale (EPMA) and small-scale analytical methods (APT) to obtain reasonable estimates for gamma' volume fractions in the dendrites and in the ID regions. The chemical and mechanical properties of the SX plates studied in the present work are homogeneous, when they are determined from gamma' volumes with dimensions, which are significantly larger than the dendrite spacing. For the SX plates (140 mm x 100 mm x 20 mm) studied in the present work this holds for the average chemical composition as well as for elastic behavior and local creep properties. We highlight the potential of HRTEM and APT to contribute to a better understanding of the role of dislocations during coarsening of the gamma' phase and the effect of cooling rates after high temperature exposure on the microstructure.

TI HRTEM analysis of the high-temperature phases of the newly developed
   high-temperature Ni-base superalloy VDM 780 Premium
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB VDM 780 Premium is a recently developed Ni-based superalloy designed for working at high service temperatures (above 650 degrees C) while keeping the good workability of alloy 718. VDM 780 Premium is based on the austenitic matrix (gamma phase) strengthened by intermetallic Ni3Al-like precipitates (gamma' phase, fcc L1(2) structure). Other co-precipitates may be formed in function of the applied heat treatment, such as Ni3Nb-based (delta phase, orthorhombic DOa structure) or Ni3Ti-based (eta phase, hexagonal DO24 structure) precipitates. The amount as well as the size and morphology of the different precipitates depend on the heat treatments performed on the alloy, playing an important role in improving the creep properties or the behavior during forging and recrystallization. This work contains a complex study using various techniques of analytical electron microscopy and synchrotron diffraction intended to clarify the structure of the high-temperature phase formed in the newly developed VDM 780 Premium alloy. The atomic structure of the high-temperature plate-like precipitates formed in VDM 780 Premium after two different thermal treatments has been investigated in relation with the surrounding matrix lattice, proving the stacked delta/eta structure of the precipitates.

TI High Strength, Ductile Braze Repairs for Stationary Gas Turbine
   Components-Part I
SO JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING FOR GAS TURBINES AND POWER-TRANSACTIONS OF THE
   ASME
AB Both aviation and land based turbine components such as vanes/nozzles, combustion chambers, liners, and transition pieces often degrade and crack in service. Rather than replacing with new components, innovative repairs can help reduce overhaul and maintenance costs. These components are cast from either Co-based solid solution superalloys such as FSX-414 or Ni-based gamma prime precipitation strengthened superalloys such as IN738. The nominal compositions of FSX-414 and IN738 are Co-29.5Cr-10.5Ni-7W-2Fe [max]-0.25C-0.012B and Ni-0.001B-0.17C-8.5Co-16Cr-1.7Mo-3.4Al-2.6W-1.7Ta-2Nb-3.4Ti-0.1Zr, respectively. Diffusion brazing has been used for over 4 decades to repair cracks and degradation on these types of components. Typically, braze materials utilized for component repairs are Ni- and Co-based braze fillers containing B and/or Si as melting point depressants. Especially when repairing wide cracks typically found on industrial gas turbine components, these melting point depressants can form brittle intermetallic boride and silicide phases that affect mechanical properties such as low cycle and thermal fatigue. The objective of this work is to investigate and evaluate the use of hypereutectic Ni-Cr-Hf and Ni-Cr-Zr braze filler metals, where the melting point depressant is no longer B, but Hf and/or Zr. Typically, with joint gaps or crack widths less than 0.15 mm, the braze filler metal alone can be utilized. For cracks greater than 0.15 mm, a superalloy powder is mixed with the braze filler metal to enable wide cracks to be successfully brazed repaired. As a means of qualifying the diffusion braze repair, both metallurgical and mechanical property evaluations were carried out. The metallurgical evaluation consisted of optical and scanning electron microscopies, and microprobe analysis. The diffusion brazed area consisted of a fine-grained equiaxed structure with carbide phases, gamma (gamma) dendrites, flower shaped/rosette gamma-gamma prime (gamma-gamma(')) eutectic phases, and Ni(7)Hf(2), Ni(5)HF, or Ni(5)Zr intermetallic phases dispersed both intergranularly and intragranularly. Hardness tests showed that the Ni-Hf and Ni-Zr intermetallic phase only has a hardness range of 250-400 HV, whereas, the typical Cr-boride phases have hardness ranges from 800 HV to 1000 HV. Therefore the hardness values of the Ni-Hf and Ni-Zr intermetallic phases are 2.5-3.2 times softer than the Cr-boride intermetallic phases. As a result the low cycle fatigue (LCF) properties of the wide gap Ni-Cr-Hf and Ni-Cr-Zr brazed joints are superior to those of the Ni-Cr-B braze filler metals. The mechanical property evaluations were tensile tests at both room temperature and elevated temperature, stress rupture test from 760 degrees C to 1093 degrees C, and finally LCF tests, the latter being one of the most important and severe tests to conduct since the cracks being repaired are thermal fatigue driven. At the optimum braze thermal cycle, the mechanical test results achieved were a minimum of 80% and sometimes equivalent to that of the base metal properties.

TI Crack formation and microstructure-sensitive propagation in low cycle
   fatigue of a polycrystalline nickel-based superalloy with different heat
   treatments
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FATIGUE
AB Gas turbine engine materials demand high performance of fatigue life under alternative loading. In this paper, crack initiation and propagation in the low cycle fatigue (LCF) of a polycrystalline nickel based superalloys was studied via experimental and numerical methods. LCF experiments were conducted with the specimens subjected to different heat treatment regimes, including of standard heat treatment (SHT), heat isostatic pressing (HIP), and combined heat treatment (HIP + SHT). Simulations based on finite element method (FEM) were implemented with the 3D digital model obtained from synchrotron radiation X-ray computerized tomography (CT) to investigate the effect of microporosity. Results indicated that microporosity was a dominant factor of fatigue crack and the parameters of microporosity including of porosity, effective diameter, and distribution co-contributed to affect fatigue life. The delta stack and carbide were observed to be fatigue crack sites. The HIP specimen had long fatigue cycle life since casting pore and acicular delta were eliminated, while further SHT can reintroduce delta into matrix resulting in high strength and low fatigue life. LCF crack behaviors in HIP + SHT superalloy depended on surface quality, stress concentration, and the quantity of carbide.

AB Iridium is one of the most promising base metals for future high-temperature structural materials. Attempts to improve the high-temperature strength of Ir have involved solid-solution hardening and coherent hardening. Hf and Zr having a larger atomic size misfit with Ir were found to be the most effective solid-solution hardening and coherent hardening elements on In The idea of multi-component alloying Ir by Hf and Zr was used for the improvement of high-temperature properties of Ir-based alloys in this work. The results show that the monolithic saturated fcc phase has an outstanding Vickers hardness at room temperature, whereas a dual-phase fcc/L1(2) structure is favorable for high-temperature strength and creep resistance. With a dual-phase fcc/L1(2), structure composed mostly of fcc phase, the Ir-5Hf-5Zr alloy has a 0.2% yield strength as high as 175 MPa, and a stable creep rate as low as 1.33 x 10(-7) S-1 at a stress of 40 MPa even at 1950 degrees C. Finally, a principle for the design of Ir-based alloy based upon the composition and microstructural morphology was discussed. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Large-area, high-resolution characterisation and classification of
   damage mechanisms in dual-phase steel using deep learning
SO PLOS ONE
AB High performance materials, from natural bone over ancient damascene steel to modern superalloys, typically possess a complex structure at the microscale. Their properties exceed those of the individual components and their knowledge-based improvement therefore requires understanding beyond that of the components' individual behaviour. Electron microscopy has been instrumental in unravelling the most important mechanisms of co-deformation and in-situ deformation experiments have emerged as a popular and accessible technique. However, a challenge remains: to achieve high spatial resolution and statistical relevance in combination. Here, we overcome this limitation by using panoramic imaging and machine learning to study damage in a dual-phase steel. This high-throughput approach now gives us strain and microstructure dependent insights into the prevalent damage mechanisms and allows the separation of inclusions and deformation induced damage across a large area of this heterogeneous material. Aiming for the first time at automated classification of the majority of damage sites rather than only the most distinct, the new method also encourages us to expand current research past interpretation of exemplary cases of distinct damage sites towards the less clear-cut reality.

TI Influence of surface roughness on the oxidation behavior of a
   Ni-4.0Cr-5.7Al single crystal superalloy
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB The high-temperature oxidation dynamics and mechanisms of a Ni-based single crystal superalloy with four kinds of surface roughnesses were investigated by virtue of XRD, OM, SEM and EDS at 1000 degrees C. In the initial oxidation stage, outer (Ni, Co)O was mainly produced on the surfaces of the samples with Ra = 90 nm and 19 nm. Correspondingly, outer Cr2O3 and transient theta-Al2O3 were mainly formed on the surfaces with Ra = 509 nm and 182 nm. After 180 min oxidation, the values of instantaneous parabolic mass gain coefficients (k(p)) of the samples with all surface roughnesses were gradually consistent with the data of the growth parabolic coefficient of alpha-Al2O3. The oxidation mechanisms of Ni-based superalloy with different surface roughnesses were discussed by a model. The external diffusion flux of Al (D-Al) increases with the increases of surface roughness. Thus, the required Al concentration decreases with the increases of surface roughness when the selective oxidation of Al occurrs to form a protective single alpha-Al2O3 film. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB A study of the crystal orientation and structural perfection of single crystal blades obtained by Bridgeman method from CMSX-4 nickel superalloy at various withdrawal rates between 1 and 5 mm/min was carried out using the Laue diffraction method and X-ray diffraction topography methods as well as electron scanning microscopy. Blades consisted mainly of the regular gamma' phase, with [001](gamma')-type direction close to the blade axis. The angle of deviation of the [001](gamma') direction in relation to the blade axis changes between the blade locking piece and end. The dependence this angle on the distance from the locking piece has been named as the crystal orientation distribution (COD). It was found that the nature of COD changes with a change in the withdrawal rate. The change in the withdrawal rate also results in a rotation of [001](gamma')-type direction in relation to the blade axis. The best blades in terms of orientation and structural perfection were obtained for the withdrawal rate of 3 mm/min. (C) 2010 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

TI Factors affecting the microstructure of platinum-modified aluminide
   coatings during a vapor phase aluminizing process
SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB Platinum (Pt)-modified aluminide coatings were developed by electroplating a thin layer of Pt followed by an industrial vapor phase aluminizing process. The goal of this work was to systematically investigate the effect of critical coating process parameters (such as the electroplated Pt thicknesses, Al contents in Cr-Al nuggets, diffusion heat treatments) and substrates on the final Pt-modified aluminide coatings. Surface morphology and cross-section microstructure of the developed coatings were inspected and compared by using Optical Microscope, Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). Experimental results showed that the Al and/or Pt increase shall favor the formation of xi-PtAl(2) phase; transformation of xi-PtAl(2) into beta-(Ni,Pt)Al phase can be obtained via a heat treatment process; Cr, Co elements in the studied Ni-base superalloy substrates did not show significant influence on coating outer layer microstructure; while substrate elements affect the microstructure of the coating interdiffusion layer.

TI Compositional design considerations for microsegregation in single
   crystal superalloy systems
SO INTERMETALLICS
CT International Symposium on Intermetallic and Advanced Materials
CY MAR 02-06, 2003
CL San Diego, CA
AB This paper investigates the role of varying refractory addition levels on the microsegregation behaviour of single crystal (SX) superalloys systems during solidification. Specifically, a series of six Ni-base alloy compositions are set in a controlled manner, such that the chemical effects of Re, W, and Ru can be independently assessed. Each experimental alloy is produced in the SX condition utilizing a modified Bridgman casting process, with subsequent compositional analysis of the solidification structures via standard electron microprobe analysis (EPMA) methods. Qualitative partitioning results indicate typical SX alloy segregation behavior with elements such as Cr, Co, Re, Mo, and W all segregating towards the dendrite core regions, while the gamma' forming elements of Al, Ti, and Ta show favorable partitioning to the interdendritic gamma-gamma' eutectic regions. Both Ni and Ru exhibit ideal segregation behaviour with no favorable partitioning to either phase. Quantitative EPMA results indicate that as the nominal Re level increases, the severity of microsegregation to the dendrite core regions rises dramatically for Mo, Cr, and Re. Remarkably, evidence is presented demonstrating the role that Ru plays in counteracting the microsegregation effects of both increased Re and higher overall total refractory levels.

TI An Atom Probe Tomography study of site preference and partitioning in a
   nickel-based superalloy
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB Atom Probe Tomography (APT) has been utilised for an in-depth examination of the commercial polycrystalline Ni-based superalloy RR1000, assessing compositions of the primary, secondary and tertiary gamma' phases. Clear differences in the phase chemistries are noted, particularly for the tertiary gamma' to which much of the alloy strength is attributed. Trace amounts of Hf are found to segregate strongly to the primary and secondary gamma' phases, but also exhibit an extended diffusion profile across the gamma-gamma' interface up to 80 nm wide. Ti, Al and Mo demonstrate similar, yet not as pronounced diffusion profiles, indicating assumed phase chemistries may not be representative of those regions adjacent to the gamma-gamma' interface. Within gamma', unique element site-occupancy preferences for this alloy were identified. Finally, the grain boundary chemistry across a gamma-gamma interface and that of an intragranular boride were analysed, identifying the latter as a mixed M5B3 boride rich in Mo and Cr. These demonstrate further the depth of information on Ni-alloys accessible by APT, while the overall implications of results in comparison with other in-service/model alloys are also discussed.

TI Fatigue crack growth under large scale yielding condition: The need of a
   characteristic length scale
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FATIGUE
AB Fatigue crack growth under large scale yielding condition is studied for a commercial base Co superalloys, Haynes (R) 188, for single edge notch (SENT) specimen. Due to very high temperature and applied strain values, it is observed that major crack interacts with micro-cracks pattern. These micro-cracks are found to be associated to strain localization and local high triaxiality stress ratio. Detailed analysis of strain localization and stress concentration was used to define an optimal characteristic length used in a non-local modeling of strain energy involved in crack growth process. To obtain robust and low time consuming crack growth modeling, a post-processing methodology is thus proposed for fatigue crack growth under large scale yielding. This point was successfully achieved for SENT specimen test series to describe crack growth rate. Finally, test driven for another geometry has enabled to validate the proposed modeling methodology.

TI Nano-sized Superlattice Clusters Created by Oxygen Ordering in
   Mechanically Alloyed Fe Alloys
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Creating and maintaining precipitates coherent with the host matrix, under service conditions is one of the most effective approaches for successful development of alloys for high temperature applications; prominent examples include Ni- and Co-based superalloys and Al alloys. While ferritic alloys are among the most important structural engineering alloys in our society, no reliable coherent precipitates stable at high temperatures have been found for these alloys. Here we report discovery of a new, nano-sized superlattice (NSS) phase in ball-milled Fe alloys, which maintains coherency with the BCC matrix up to at least 913 degrees C. Different from other precipitates in ferritic alloys, this NSS phase is created by oxygen-ordering in the BCC Fe matrix. It is proposed that this phase has a chemistry of Fe3O and a Do(3) crystal structure and becomes more stable with the addition of Zr. These nano-sized coherent precipitates effectively double the strength of the BCC matrix above that provided by grain size reduction alone. This discovery provides a new opportunity for developing high-strength ferritic alloys for high temperature applications.

AB Pt-modified Ni aluminicles and MCrAlY coatings (where M = Ni and/or Co) are widely used on turbine blades and vanes for protection against oxidation and corrosion and as bond coatings in thermal barrier coating (TBC) systems. The present work shows the ability of a new fabrication technique, the Spark Plasma Sintering, to develop rapidly new coating compositions and microstructurres. This technique allows combining powders and metallic foils on a superalloy substrate in order to obtain multilayered coatings in a single short experiment. Fabrication of MCrAlY overlays with local Pt and/or Al enrichment is shown, as well as fabrication of coatings made of xi-PtAl2, epsilon-PtAl, alpha-AlNiPt2, martensitic beta-(Ni,Pt)Al or Pt-rich gamma/gamma' phases. The realization of a complete TBC system with a porous and adherent Yttria Stabilized Zirconia (YSZ) layer on a gamma/gamma' low mass bond coating is also demonstrated. Difficulties of fabrication are reviewed and discussed, such as Y segregation, risks of carburization, local overheating, or difficulty to coat complex shape parts. Finally, some first results of cyclic oxidation are given. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Microstructural and Wear Characteristics of High Velocity Oxygen Fuel
   (HVOF) Sprayed NiCrBSi-SiC Composite Coating on SAE 1030 Steel
SO ARABIAN JOURNAL FOR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
AB In this paper, wear properties of NiCrBSi-SiC coatings were investigated using the ball-on-disk wear test. In experimental study, NiCrBSi-SiC powders were sprayed using a high-velocity oxygen fuel technique on an SAE 1030 steel substrate. Powder mixtures with different weight mixing ratios, NiCrBSi + 10 wt% SiC, NiCrBSi + 20 wt% SiC and NiCrBSi + 40 wt% SiC coatings were prepared. The deposited coatings are compared in terms of their phase composition, microstructure and hardness. It is proved that the degree of mixing of the NiCrBSi and SiC components in the powder has a massive effect on the phase composition, microstructure and hardness of the coatings. Wear tests were conducted on both the uncoated and coated substrates at same normal load, speed, and wear distance. It has been determined that the coated substrates exhibit a very good tribological performance in comparison to the uncoated substrate. The increase in the adhesive wear resistance provided by the coating has been attributed to the presence of a large amount of dispersed Ni and Cr carbide and/or borides in the Ni matrix.

AB Experiments and thermodynamic calculations were performed on five cobalt-base superalloys containing tantalum carbide and chromium carbides in order to evaluate the accuracy of thermodynamic calculations for this alloy family. The studied quantities were the solidus temperature and the phase fractions of the different carbides observed after a long exposure time at different high temperatures. The predicted and observed phases are in good agreement. However the measured phase fractions and melting temperatures were sometimes higher than the calculated values. The disagreement in the phase fractions can be attributed to the fact that surface fractions and volume fractions are not necessarily equal. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Influence of milling direction in the machinability of Inconel 718 with
   submicron grain cemented carbide tools
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY
AB The nickel-based alloys have a growing demand in many fields due to their outstanding properties at high temperatures. These properties lead to relatively low machinability, one of the main obstacles to its more extensive use. Improvements in cutting tool quality are one of the key points to overcome the challenges. The decrease to a submicron scale of the grains of cemented carbide tools is one of the alternatives to improve the machinability of the nickel-based superalloys. In this paper, two different grades of submicron grains of uncoated cemented carbide tools, TMG30 (10% Co, S30-40) and CTS18D (9% Co, S20-40), were evaluated in the end milling process of Inconel 718, through a 2(4) factorial design of experiments having as parameters the cutting speed, feed rate, machining direction (up and down milling), and tool grade. The tool life, machining power, and surface roughness were used as machinability evaluators. It was found that the machining direction, cutting speed, and feed rate had a significant influence on the machinability output variables, with the machining direction being the most significant one. The differences in the two tool grades were too small to be statistically significant. Simulations using the finite element method of the effective plastic strain, validated by the measurement of experimental machining power, showed that the up milling presented around 14% more plastic deformation than the down milling, which combined with the work-hardenability of the Inconel 718 explains the shorter tool life of this condition.

TI On the high-temperature oxidation protection behavior of plasma-sprayed
   stellite-6 coatings
SO METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND
   MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB High-temperature oxidation resistance of the superalloys can be greatly increased by plasma-sprayed coatings, and this is a growing industry of considerable economic importance. The purpose of these coatings is to form long-lasting oxidation protective scales. In the current investigation, Stellite-6 coatings were deposited on two Ni-base superalloys, Superni 601 and Superni 718, and one Fe-base superalloy, Superfer 800H, by a shrouded plasma spray process. Oxidation studies were conducted on the coated superalloys in air at 900 C under cyclic conditions for 50 cycles. Each cycle consisted of 1 hour heating followed by 20 minutes of cooling in air. The thermogravimetric technique was used to approximate the kinetics of oxidation. All of the coated superalloys nearly followed the parabolic rate law of oxidation. X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray (SEM/EDAX), and electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) techniques were used to analyze the oxidation products. The Stellite-6 coating was found to be successful in maintaining its continuous surface contact with the superalloy substrates in all cases. The oxide scales formed on the oxidized coated superalloys were found to be intact and spallation free. The main phases analyzed for the coated superalloys were oxides of cobalt and chromium and spinel of cobalt and chromium, which are suggested to be useful for developing oxidation resistance at high temperatures.

TI Effective Hf-Pd Co-doped beta-NiAl(Cr) coatings for single-crystal
   superalloys
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB Cyclic oxidation behavior of beta NiAlCr coatings was investigated at 1150 degrees C with emphasis on effective Pd + Hf and Pt + Hf co-doping composition and the concomitant phase transformations and interdiffusion of Pd and Pt into the substrate. Coatings with compositions in the range of Ni-(33-39)Al-5Cr-(2-5)Pd/Pt were deposited on Rene N5 single-crystal substrates and subjected to long-term cyclic oxidation. The Pt + Hf- and Pd + Hf-modified overlay coatings exhibited comparable oxidation kinetics and matched the range of oxidation behavior exhibited by the standard Pt-aluminide coating. In particular, additions of about (2-5)Pd+(0.15-0.3)Hf and (2-5)Pt+(0.15-0.3)Hf among the studied composition range exhibited long lifetimes of >2000 oxidation cycles. A positive synergistic effect between Pd Hf and Pt Hf was clearly observed when comparing the lifetimes of beta NiAlCr-Pd and beta NiAlCr-Pt quaternary coatings with the quinary coatings. Transformations from beta -> 3R + 7R-martensites at low temperature and beta -> gamma' -> gamma + gamma' at high temperature occurred in both Pd- and Pt-modified coatings due to Al depletion to substrate and surface oxide. A greater depletion of Pd to the substrate compared to Pt was observed at 1150 degrees C compared to 1100 degrees C; the interdiffusion coefficients were consistent with those measured in NiAl-NiAl + Pt/Pd diffusion couples. These results are very encouraging in supporting the exploration of Pd-modified coating supplanting the currently used, expensive Pt-based coatings. (C) 2014 Acta Materialia Inc.

The chemical compositions of new type nickel-based P/M superalloy were designed combining with d-electron theory. The results show that the contents of Cr, Co, Mo and W mainly influence the precipitation temperature and amount of TCP and gamma' phases in Rene104. The suggested contents of Cr and Co are 13% and 20.6% respectively, and the suggested content of Mo is higher than W. The results also show that the content ratios of Al/Ti and Nb/Ta affect the precipitation behaviours of TCP and gamma' phases. The balance values of Al/Ti and Nb/Ta are suggested in order to make the alloy having desired microstructural stability and strengthening effect. In addition, Hf also influenced the precipitation behaviours of TCP and gamma' phases and the suggested content of Hf is 0.2%. The main precipitates of the new type P/M turbine disk superalloy FGH98I are gamma', MC, M23C6 and M3B2, and no any TCP phases precipitate. After the exposure at 750 degrees C, 815 degrees C and 850 degrees C for 1000 h, the new alloy still shows good microstructural stability.(C) 2011 Published Elsevier Ltd.

AB Cyclic oxidation tests were carried out on simple beta-(CoNi)Al, Hafnium (Hf)-modified beta-(CoNi)Al, Platinum (Pt)-modified beta-(CoNi)Al+xi-PtAl2, and Hf-Pt-modified beta-(CoNi)l coatings on Co-based Haynes-188 substrates at 1050 degrees C in air for up to 4670 h to identify the effects of Hf doping. The results showed that the beta-(CoNi)Al coating reached 0.55 mg/cm(2) weight gain at 1960 h and became unstable, resulting in massive spallation at the sample edges; the Hf-(CoNi)Al coating exhibited stable weight gain up to 4520 h followed by a rapid weight increase, corresponding to the formation of Cr- and Mn-containing spinel phases. Both Pt-(CoNi)Al+xi-PtAl2 and Hf-Pt-(CoNi)Al coatings showed stable weight gain for the duration of the test. Examination of the surface and cross-section microstructure by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) equipped with Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) indicated that the original coating was completely transformed into a gamma-(CoNiCr...) phase in the (CoNi)Al and Hf-(CoNi)Al coatings, leading to the formation of Cr2O3 scales or spinel phases. The beta-(CoNiPt)Al phase persisted to the end of the test in the Pt-(CoNi)Al and Hf-Pt-(CoNi)Al coatings, showing dense, adherent Al2O3 scales. The oxidation resistance from the best to the worst can be ranked as: Hf-Pt-(CoNi)Al or Pt-(CoNi)Al>Hf-(CoNi)Al>(CoNi)Al. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Microstructural evolution and compression property of a novel gamma
   '-strengthened directionally solidified CoNi-base superalloy
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB The microstructural evolution and compression property of a novel gamma'-strengthened CoNi-base superalloy have been investigated. The directionally solidified CoNi-base superalloy possesses a lower density of 9.03 g/cm(3) and a higher gamma' solvus temperature of 1166 degrees C, compared with those of the Co-Al-W-base superalloys with high level of W element. After aging at 900-1100 degrees C, the alloy displays stable gamma/gamma' two-phase microstructure with high volume fraction of the gamma' phase, and without detrimental topologically close-packed (TCP) phase. The CoNi-base superalloy shows good compression property. In the process of compression, the alloy exhibits positive temperature dependence of the 0.2% flow stress above 600 degrees C. With increasing temperature, the alloy displays a maximum of 0.2% flow stress of 607 MPa at 850 degrees C. The major deformation mechanisms of the CoNi-base alloy are pairs of a/2 < 110 > -type dislocations shearing gamma' precipitates from room temperature to 850 degrees C and unpaired dislocations bypassing the gamma' precipitates above the peak temperature of 850 degrees C. In this alloy, high content of Ni improves the gamma' solvus temperature and microstructural stability, which leads to a good compression property at high temperatures.

TI A new computational approach for modelling the microstructural evolution
   and residual lifetime assessment of MCrAlY coatings
SO MATERIALS AT HIGH TEMPERATURES
AB MCrAlY (M=Ni, Co) coatings are commonly used to protect the underlying superalloy component in industrial gas turbines and aeroengines from oxidation attack. They also function as bond coats for thermal barrier coatings (TBC). The chemical life time of the coated component is mainly governed by the depletion of the beta-phase in the bond coat as a result of simultaneously occurring surface oxidation and interdiffusion between the coating and the substrate. A new computational approach to model the microstructural evolution in MCrAlY (M=Ni, Co) coatings on Ni base superalloys was undertaken in the present study. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and wavelength dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (WDX) was employed to characterise MCrAlY coated superalloy samples after exposure at 1000 and 1100 degrees C. Phases were identified by electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and correlated with SEM/EDX/WDX analyses.
   Modelling of the microstructural evolution was carried out considering simultaneously occurring surface oxidation and interdiffusion processes. A flux based calculation of the concentration profiles and stable phases was performed, taking into account diffusion of all elements in the gamma, gamma ' and beta-NiAl phases. Good agreement was found between the observed and computed phase distributions after specific time intervals. The computed widths of the beta-depletion zones showed satisfactory agreement with the measurements. Additionally, the model was able to predict the formation of a TCP-phase and its penetration into the substrate with increasing exposure time in one of the investigated coating systems.

TI Microstructural characterization of a new mechanically alloyed Ni-base
   ODS superalloy powder
SO MATERIALS CHARACTERIZATION
AB The microstructure of a new Ni-base oxide dispersion strengthened superalloy powder was studied for high temperature gas turbine.applications after the mechanical alloying process. In this study, an atomized powder with a composition similar to the CMSX-10 superalloy was mechanically alloyed with yttria and Hf powders. The mechanically alloyed powder included only the supersaturated solid solution gamma phase without gamma' and yttria provided by severe plastic deformation, while after the 3-step aging, the gamma' phase was precipitated due to the partitioning of Al and Ta to the gamma' and Co, Cr, Re, W, and Mo to the gamma phase. Mechanical alloying modified the morphology of gamma' to the new coherent gamma-gamma' nanoscale lamellar structure to minimize the elastic strain energy of the precipitation, which yielded a low lattice misfit of 0.16% at high temperature. The gamma' lamellae aligned preferentially along the elastically soft [100] direction. Also, the precipitated oxide particles were refined in the gamma phase by adding Hf from large incoherent YAlO3 to fine semi-coherent Y2Hf2O7 oxide particles with the average size of 7 nm and low interparticle spacing of 76 nm.

TI Microstructure-Mechanical Properties Relation of TLP-Bonded FSX-414
   Superalloy: Effect of Homogenization Design
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING AND PERFORMANCE
AB Co-based FSX-414 superalloy is especially used for first-stage nozzles of gas turbines. Transient liquid phase (TLP) bonding has potential as repair process for these nozzles. In this study, homogenization of TLP-bonded FSX-414 superalloy at optimum bonding condition (1150 A degrees C/5 min) was conducted at 1175, 1200, and 1225 A degrees C for 1, 3, and 6 h. Homogenization at 1175 A degrees C/1 h had no effect on removing the diffusion-affected zone (DAZ) phases. Increasing the time to 6 h was effective in removing DAZ phases and boride phases formed due to liquefaction, but compositional homogenization was not complete. Homogenization at 1200 A degrees C for 1 h caused boride phases to form adjacent to the joint and in the base metal. By increasing the time to 3 h produced joint, free of these phases. At 1225 A degrees C/3 h homogenization condition, using a Ni-etchant and EDS analysis across the joint showed appropriate combination of compositional and microstructural homogenization including removed DAZ phases. The highest hardness, the most uniform hardness profile across the joint, and the highest shear strength (91% of the base metal strength) in addition to the microstructural features showed the best joints homogenizing at 1225 A degrees C for 3 h.

TI Effects of Vanadium Intergranular Segregation at FCC/L1(2) Interfaces in
   Ni-Al-V Alloys
SO JOURNAL OF PHASE EQUILIBRIA AND DIFFUSION
AB A study of the interfacial properties of Ni-Al-V alloys is presented further, together with the interatomic potentials of the Ni-Al-V ternary phase system given in this paper, with the application of the Phase-field method and atomistic simulations, based on the second nearest-neighbor modified embedded-atom method (2NN MEAM) potential formalism. It is discovered that the alloy elements have different preferences of segregation or depletion at the (100) FCC/L1(2) interface (the gamma-FCC-Ni(Al, V) and the L1(2)-Ni-3(Al, V)) of diffusion phases. Nickel atoms segregate first and then deplete, Vanadium atoms segregate while aluminum atoms deplete at the (100) FCC/L1(2) interfaces forming new diffusion phases. Both, vanadium segregation and aluminum depletion affect the alloy's interfacial properties which in turn, will lower the interfacial energy and increase the work of separation. The results of the Phase-field method coincide with the results of the atomistic computation based on the 2NN MEAM method. Furthermore, the applicability of the atomistic approach to an elaborate alloy design of advanced Ni-based superalloys through the investigation of the effect of alloying elements at the interfacial properties is discussed.

AB Aeronautic gas turbine blades, vanes and combustion chambers are protected against high temperature oxidation and corrosion by single or multilayered coatings. These include environmental coatings, generally based on Pt-modified Ni aluminides or MCrAlY overlays (where M = Ni and/or Co), thermal barrier coating (TBC) systems including a ceramic thermally insulating layer, and abradable seals. The present work shows the ability of the Spark Plasma Sintering technique to rapidly develop new coatings compositions and microstructures. This technique allows combining powders and metallic foils on a superalloy substrate in order to obtain multilayered coatings in a single short production step. Fabrication of MCrAlY overlays with local Pt and/or Al enrichments is shown, as well as fabrication of coatings made of zeta-PtAl2, epsilon-PtAl, alpha-AlNiPt2, martensitic and beta-(Ni,Pt)Al or Pt-rich gamma/gamma' phases, including their doping with reactive elements. The fabrication of a complete TBC system with a porous and adherent Yttria Stabilized Zirconia (YSZ) layer on a bond-coating is also demonstrated, as well as the fabrication of a CoNiCrAlY-based cermet coating for abradable seal application. Difficulties of fabrication are reviewed, such as Y segregation, risks of carburization, local over-heating, or difficulty to coat complex shaped parts. Solutions are given to overcome these difficulties.

TI High temperature environmental resistant Mo-Si-B based coatings
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REFRACTORY METALS & HARD MATERIALS
AB For high temperature applications nickel base superalloys with aluminide coatings are reaching the service limit. Alternate materials such as refractory metal silicide alloys can extend high temperature capability, but the silica surfaces require coatings for enhanced environmental resistance. We present a review of an effective strategy to achieve the environmental resistance through the use of an integrated Mo-Si-B based coating that is applied by a co-deposition of Si and B by pack cementation. During oxidation of the (Si + B)-pack alloys, the initial MoSi2 outer layer is consumed by formation of the Mo5Si3 (T-1) phase and the development of the underlying Mo5SiB2, T-2 borosilicide and/or MoB boride phase layer. The T-1 phase with B has excellent oxidation resistance and the loss of Si to the substrate is blocked by the underlying diffusion barrier (T-2). Any damage to the outer T-1 layer can be recovered from the T-2 MoB layer to yield a self-healing characteristic. The Mo-Si-B based coating on Mo based alloys exhibits robust performance up to at least 1700 degrees C not only to high temperature oxidation, but also to water vapor and corrosive deposit attack. Some of the applications are discussed for use of the coating strategy on ceramic materials.

TI A Comprehensive Review of Corrosion Resistance of Thermally-Sprayed and
   Thermally-Diffused Protective Coatings on Steel Structures
SO JOURNAL OF THERMAL SPRAY TECHNOLOGY
AB Protective coatings are widely utilized to promote corrosion resistance of the surfaces of steel components that are used in various industrial applications. Different surface engineering methods such as thermal spraying and thermal diffusion techniques can be used to fabricate these protective coatings. Thermal spraying processes have received significant attention due to their ability to deposit a variety of materials. Several metals such as zinc-, aluminum-, nickel, and chromium-based materials and their alloys can be deposited using thermal spraying processes to enhance the corrosion resistance and prolong the service life of steel components. On the other hand, technologies based on thermal diffusion techniques are emerging due to their unique deposition features, which alleviates the issues of cracking and delamination typical of thermal-sprayed coatings, as well as their ability to protect inaccessible and complex components such as the inner surface of long tubing and pipelines. This work is a comprehensive review on short and long-term corrosion resistance of the most effective and commonly-used coatings deposited by a variety of surface engineering techniques to protect steel structures. Moreover, the effect of the spraying process, the addition of alloying elements on the corrosion resistance of these coatings has also been reviewed in this study.

TI Incorporation and evolution of ZrO2 nano-particles in Pt-modified
   aluminide coating for high temperature applications
SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB ZrO2 nano-particles were incorporated into electro-deposited PtAl coatings in an attempt to enhance their performance by exploiting the effect of reactive element oxides. PtAl coatings with and without ZrO2 particles were deposited onto three commercially available Ni-based superalloys: Mar-M247, Mar-M246 and Inconel 718. After aluminising and annealing, thermal cycling oxidation tests were carried out to evaluate the influence of Zr02 addition and substrate composition. Cross-sectional SEM images were obtained to characterise the coatings after deposition, after heat treatment and after 200 thermal cycles. The addition of ZrO2 particles to PtAI coatings on Mar-M-246 and Inconel 718 appeared to increase the growth of thermally grown oxide and reduce its rumpling. However, such effects were not observed for the addition of ZrO2 particles to the PtAI coatings on Mar-M247. The analysis of the coatings on different substrates revealed and elucidated the interactions between Hf, Al and ZrO2, providing better understanding of reactions of ZrO2 and the influence of the substrate on bond coat behaviour.(C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TI CHARACTERISTIC AND FORMATION MECHANISM OF PRECIPITATES AT
   RECRYSTALLIZATION GRAIN BOUNDARIES OF SINGLE CRYSTAL SUPERALLOY DD6
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB Single crystal superalloys have extremely good elevated temperature capability in advanced gas turbine aero engines due to no highly stressed grain boundaries in them. With the removal of grain boundary strengthening elements such as C, B and Zr, the occurrence of recrystallization may be detrimental to their performance. Therefore, recrystallization becomes critical in industrial manufacture of single crystal superalloy blades. In the present study, specimens of single crystal superalloy DD6 were grit blasted, solution treated and aged at vacuum atmosphere, and then the precipitates at recrystallization grain boundaries were investigated by SEM, TEM, EPMA and Thermo-Calc. The results show that a few of M6C carbides precipitate at recrystallization grain boundaries, and their size is about 0.5 mu m. These M6C carbides are rich in W, Re and Mo, but poor in Al, Ta, Ni, the contents of Cr, Nb, Co in them are almost the same as the nominal composition of DD6 alloy. The carbon accumulation at recrystallization boundaries and combination with mu phase forming elements such as W and Mo restrain the p, phase forming. M23C6 phase hardly forms in DD6 alloy due to its high W and low Cr content.

AB K465 superalloy was thermally exposed, respectively at 850, 950, 1000, 1050 and 1100 degrees C. During thermal exposure, topologically close-packed phases, such as sigma and mu, are precipitated in interdendritic regions where rapid diffusion paths are provided and the TCP forming elements W, Mo, Cr, Co are concentrated. The exposure temperature is shown to have a great impact on the formation and growth of TCP phases. a phase is readily formed at the lower annealing temperature (below 950 degrees C), having a basket weave or multi-layer structure whereas becomes instable at the higher exposure temperature above 950 degrees C. The disappearance of mu phase at higher temperature mainly results from the formation of M23C6 and M6C carbides because they can combine with the larger amounts of the a forming element, Cr. The precipitation of mu phase is mainly depended on M6C carbide, and its morphology exhibits coarse needles or platelets. mu phase is stable above 950 degrees C, and the amount of mu phase reaches the peak value at 1000 degrees C, but is decreased above 1000 degrees C.

AB The effect of cobalt on chemical segregation and solution process in three nickel base single crystal superalloys was investigated. Three alloys containing the mass fraction of cobalt of 12% (named Alloy 1), 3% (named Alloy 2) and 0 (named Alloy 3), respectively were studied, in which the contents of other elements were same. The results show that the segregation extent of W, Re, Ta, Al between dendrite and interdendritic region rises with the increase of cobalt content. The incipient melting points decrease by 10 degrees C and 20 degrees C respectively when the content of cobalt increases from 0 through 3% to 12%. During solid solution at 1 340 degrees C, the solid solution of large gamma prime in interdendritic region and the dissolution of eutectic in alloy I become easier than in other two alloys. After heat-treatment at 1 340 degrees C for 8 h, the segregation extent of elements in alloy 1 decreases dramatically, while in alloy 2 and alloy 3, the segregation ratios decrease slowly. It suggests that the higher content of cobalt can accelerate the diffusion process at high temperature.

TI The structural evolution of superalloy ingots during hot working
SO JOM-JOURNAL OF THE MINERALS METALS & MATERIALS SOCIETY
AB This article provides an overview of structural changes that occur during the hot working of superalloys and provides insight into the use of precipitated particles and other thermomechanical factors to achieve desired structures. Examples will focus primarily on alloys 718 and 720, which are iron-nickel and nickel-based alloys, respectively. The availability of a second phase to control grain size is a characteristic of some iron-nickel- and nickel-based superalloys that is not usually available to cobalt-based superalloys; processing with and without the use of a precipitated phase that influences microstructures will be illustrated by the use of these examples.

TI Wear on SiAlON ceramic tools in drilling of aerospace grade CFRP
   composites
SO WEAR
AB Carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites are difficult to cut materials due to their anisotropic structure and extremely abrasive nature of the carbon fibers. The tool materials used for drilling of CFRP composites are limited; thus there is always a strong demand for new tool materials which can be utilized successfully for the high performance drilling process. In this study, wear behavior of different SiAlON ceramics, which are successfully used for machining of various materials such as gray cast iron, superalloys, etc., on the drilling of CFRP composites was investigated, compared and reported for the first time in the literature. Three different SiAlON-based drilling tools with the same geometry were manufactured and tested on the drilling of aerospace grade CFRP composites and their wear behaviors were compared to that of commercially available WC-Co tools. It was observed that the wear of the SiAlON tools occurs as micro-chipping of the cutting edge in the first few holes; then, severe abrasion takes place with further drilling. While SiAlON with high fracture toughness shows less micro-chipping, which occurs at the initial stage (1-5 holes) of the drilling process, SiAlON with high hardness has the highest abrasion resistance at the later stage. The increase in wear of the cutting edge of the SiAlONs and the WC-Co tools causes an increase in thrust force, and consequently, in peel-up delamination, which are desired to be as low as possible in order to achieve high performance from the drilling tools.

   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB The purpose of this study was to produce Co-based Stellite 6 superalloy components by using the method of Powder Injection Molding (PIM) and to characterize the microstructural and mechanical properties of the produced components. The experimental studies were started through the formation of feedstock by mixing Stellite 6 powder with a multicomponent binder system. Prepared feedstock was formed by utilizing powder injection molding technique. Then the molded samples were subjected to the solvent and thermal debinding processes. Different sintering cycles were applied to the raw components for the purpose of determining the optimum sintering conditions. The densities of the sintered components were determined in accordance with the Archimedes' principle. The microstructural characterization was performed through scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis, energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) analyses, and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. Hardness measurement and tensile test were conducted in order to determine the mechanical properties. The results illustrated that the injection molded Stellite 6 components were composed of fine and equiaxed grains, plenty of carbide precipitates exhibiting homogenous distribution throughout the microstructure formed at the grain boundaries and thus the mechanical properties were considerably high.

TI Influence of process parameter variation during thermo-mechanical
   processing of an intermetallic beta-stabilized gamma-TiAl based alloy
SO MATERIALS CHARACTERIZATION
AB The effort of weight reduction in modern aircraft engines, while improving performance and efficiency, demands novel light-weight high temperature materials to replace heavy nickel-based superalloys for low pressure turbine blades. Low density, high specific stiffness, elevated-temperature strength retention as well as good environmental resistance make gamma-TiAl based alloys a promising substitute. The requirement for high and balanced mechanical properties of low pressure turbine blades in next generation aircraft engines favors a hot working strategy. Thermo-mechanical processing, however, of gamma-TiAl based alloys is a challenging task due to a narrow "processing window". Isothermal forging, state-of-the-art process for this material class, leads to high tooling and forging costs. With this in mind, Bohler Schmiedetechnik GmbH & Co KG has developed a "near conventional" thermo-mechanical processing technology. A die temperature about 400 degrees C to 800 degrees C below billet temperature and processing under standard atmosphere as well as usage of a conventional hydraulic press with high ram speed result in a more economical process. Subsequent heat treatment strategies can be used to tailor microstructure and, therefore, mechanical properties according to customer requirements.
   This paper summarizes industrial forging trials as well as mechanical testing and shows the effect of process variations on the final components' properties. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI High Temperature Oxidation Behavior of Alloy 617 and Haynes 230 in
   Impurity-Controlled Helium Environments
SO OXIDATION OF METALS
AB The high temperature oxidation behavior of alloy 617 and Haynes 230 have been investigated for VHTR intermediate heat exchanger applications. Oxidation tests were carried out for up to 500 h at 900 A degrees C and 1000 A degrees C in impure helium environments containing H-2, H2O, CO, CO2, and CH4. The oxidation kinetics of the alloys followed a parabolic rate law in all cases. In the impure helium environments with very low oxygen, the external oxides of alloy 617 were composed of a Cr2O3 layer, TiO2 ridges on the grain boundaries, and isolated MnCr2O4 grains on top of the Cr2O3 layer. On the other hand, those of Haynes 230 consisted of a Cr2O3 inner layer and a protective MnCr2O4 outer layer, which increased the oxidation resistance. The effect of small amounts of CH4 and H-2 on the oxidation kinetics of the alloys was insignificant. Irregular oxide morphology, such as cellular Cr2O3 oxides for alloy 617 and MnCr2O4 platelets for Haynes 230, was formed in the impure helium environment at 900 A degrees C. For Haynes 230, along with platelets, whiskers were frequently found at the tip of the MnCr2O4 oxide crystals.

AB The most commonly used structural materials for blades and other high temperature components of gas turbines are nickel base superalloys. A TBC protection coating system consists of a top coat of yttria partially stabilized zirconia and an underlying bond coat, usually MCrAlY (where M stands for Ni, Co or a combination of both). MCrAlYs are normally deposited by the thermal spray processes: air plasma spray (APS), vacuum plasma spray (VPS/LPPS) or high velocity oxygen fuel (HVOF). The adhesion between the bond coat and the substrate, and therefore of the whole thermal barrier system, strongly depends upon the surface roughness. A high level of roughness generally denotes better adhesion, especially with the HVOF thermal spray process where it is a necessity. Generally the roughness is reached by means of grit blasting with an abrasive media; this results in a certain level of surface contamination due to the entrapment of abrasive particles. The aim of this work was to set up a new surface preparation process in order to obtain a completely clean surface with a suitable roughness, which can be coated afterwards with HVOF or VPS/LPPS thermal spray technology. The tests carried out by this process on turbine blades, coated with a HVOF system, led to obtaining a coating/base material interface without any contamination caused by the surface preparation.

TI Precipitation phases in the nickel-based superalloy DZ 125 with
   YSZ/CoCrAlY thermal barrier coating
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Interdiffusion behavior of the thermal barrier coating (TBC) with the CoCrAlY bond coat (BC) and directionally solidified Ni-based superalloy DZ 125 was investigated. Severe inward-diffusion of Al, Co and Cr from the BC to the superalloy and outward diffusion of Ni and refractory elements such as W from the superalloy occur during annealing at 1050 degrees C in air. After 100 h annealing, a similar to 30 mu m thick inter-diffusion zone (IDZ) forms between the BC and superalloy, and a similar to 35 mu m thick secondary reaction zone (SRZ) forms beneath the IDZ. The IDZ mainly consists of beta phase and gamma matrix. Besides, small amount of Ta and Hf containing carbides are also observed in the IDZ. Needle and fine granular topologically close-packed (TCP) phases, characterized as rhombohedral mu phases, are abundant in the SRZ. The formation of SRZ is mainly due to the precipitation of refractory elements such as W and Mo from the gamma matrix and beta phase. The formation mechanism of SRZ and mu-TCP phase is discussed.

TI Effect of the alloying element on the temperature-dependent ideal shear
   strength of gamma '-Ni3Al
SO RSC ADVANCES
AB The temperature-dependent ideal shear strength (tau(IS)) of gamma'-Ni3Al and the effects of alloying (Re, Ru, Mo, Cr, Co, W, and Ta) were studied in terms of first-principles calculations within the {111} slip plane along the [11 - 2] and [-110] directions. Based on the predicted volume versus temperature relations, the temperature dependence of tau(IS) was obtained using the quasistatic approach, where it was found that tau(IS) gradually decreased with increasing temperature. For the {111}[11 - 2] slip systems, all of the alloying elements except for Co were found to improve the tau(IS) of gamma'-Ni3Al at the considered temperature. Among these elements, Re was the most effective element, and doping a small amount of Re (similar to 3 at%) was found to increase tau(IS) by similar to 23.5% at 0 K. Next, W and Mo increased the tau(IS) by 20.2 and 18.1%, respectively. For the {111}[- 110] slip systems, only Re increased the tau(IS) of gamma'-Ni3Al while the other dopants decreased the ideal shear strength of the system at 0 K. Interestingly, a high-temperature relative strengthening via W alloying was observed for the gamma'-Ni3Al phase within the {111}[- 110] slip system at temperatures T > 800 K. However, the sequence of the tau(IS) of the gamma'-Ni3Al phase doped with other alloying elements was not altered by increasing temperature. According to these calculations, Re and W at the Al sites can effectively improve the shear resistance of the gamma'-Ni3Al phase, and especially at high temperature. Furthermore, the effect of alloying upon the shear strength is understood by the electronic structure analysis.

TI Strengths and Microstructure of SUS316L Fabricated by Selective Laser

SO JOURNAL OF THE JAPAN INSTITUTE OF METALS AND MATERIALS
AB Recently, AM ( Additive Manufacturing) process which can produce highly complex components have been gaining significant attention in both industry and academic research. Numerous metals and alloys have been processed by selective laser melting; Ti alloys, Ni alloys, and Co-Cr alloys have been the subjects of recent work. Ni-based superalloys have precipitated phases such as gamma' and gamma '' phase and Ti alloys and Co-Cr alloys are the multiphase alloys which have phase transformation, thus it is difficult to clarify the influential factors of AM process on strengths of these alloys. In this study, we used SUS316L stainless steel which is a single-phase solid-solution alloy and does not have precipitated phase in order to clarify characteristic influential factors of AM compared with a conventional material. SUS316L was fabricated by selective laser melting by ytterbium fiber laser from fine metallic powder. It was found that the coarse columnar grains grew up along the built direction and the columnar cell structure of dislocations which are induced during the AM process. During the solution heat treatment, the dislocation recovery was observed. AM specimens showed higher tensile and creep strengths compared with the conventional (hot working) material because of the high. density of dislocations. Ductility of AM specimens was lower than the conventional material because of defects due to lack of fusion at molten pool boundaries; furthermore, the specimens whose loading direction corresponds to built direction showed lower strength and elongation than the specimens whose loading direction perpendicular to built direction due to the oriented defects.

TI Microstructural nature and stability of Co-rich TCP phases in
   Ru-containing single crystal superalloys
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Destruction of microstructural stability caused by topologically close-packed (TCP) phase precipitation restricted the industrial application of advanced single crystal superalloys. However, systematic investigations on microstructural nature and evolution of Co-rich TCP phases in Ru-containing single crystal superalloys with high level of Co addition have been rarely reported. In this study, experimental results indicated that the main TCP phase was mu phase after thermal exposure at 950 degrees C for 1000 h, while R phase was the main phase after thermal exposure at 1100 degrees C for 1000 h in the alloys containing high level of Co and different levels of Cr and Mo. The experimental and thermodynamic calculation results showed that R phase was more stable at 1100 degrees C than that of m phase in the experimental alloys. Meanwhile, m phase started to transform to R phase at 1100 degrees C for 50 h, and the stress accelerated the transformation of m phase and R phase during creep test at 1100 degrees C/140 MPa in an alloy containing high levels of Co, Cr and Mo additions. Both R phase and m phase were enriched in Re, W, Mo, Cr and Co, while R phase contained more Cr and m phase was more enriched in Mo. This study contributes to better understand the microstructural evolution of TCP phases at different temperatures and to optimize the alloy design and thermodynamic database of Ru-containing single crystal superalloys with high level of Co addition.

TI STUDY ON THE PRECIPITATION AND DISSOLUTION OF sigma PHASE IN A HOT
   CORROSION RESISTANCE CAST NICKLE BASE SUPERALLOY
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB The experimental alloy is designed and employed in high-performance industrial gas turbines as low-pressure turbine blades, working in temperature range of 750 similar to 900 degrees C. The alloy contains high levels of refractory elements in order to increase the high-temperature mechanical properties. However, this can make the alloy prone to the formation of sigma phase during service, which could deteriorate the properties further if the fraction of sigma phase exceeds the safety allowances. In this study, the formation of sigma phase during long-term thermal exposure, dissolution of the sigma phase during rejuvenation process and their influence on stress-rupture properties of a hot-corrosion resistant nickel base superalloy have been investigated. During long-term thermal exposure at 800 similar to 900 degrees C for up to 1 x 10(4) h, the sigma phase formation is mainly in dendrite cores with a few at interdendritic regions. As the aging temperature increases, the precipitation rate of sigma phase increases and the incubation time for nucleation of sigma phase decreases. From the kinetic analysis, the sigma phase form firstly in the vicinity or on the M23C6 in dendrite cores with the strong segregation of W, Cr and Co. The calculated activation energies of a formation show that the early stage is related to Co and Cr diffusions and the steady stage is related to Mo diffusion. During solid solution process at 1000 similar to 1170 degrees C the sigma phase precipitated during long-term thermal exposure dissolves to gamma matrix. As the solid solution temperature is higher, the dissolution of a phase becomes faster. Moreover, the sigma phase does not embrittle the alloy. The reheat treatment of the alloy leads to the dissolution of precipitated sigma phase and further prolongs the stress-rupture life efficiently.

TI Microstructure prediction of TMW-4M3 during heat treatment
SO COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB The calculation model on the basis of multi-phase-field model, coupled with the calculation of phase diagram (CALPHAD) approach and classical nucleation theory (CNT) model, was studied for the precipitation behavior of gamma' precipitates in Ni-Co base superalloy TMW-4M3 ("TMW" is a trademark of National Institute for Materials Science registered in Japan) during the heat treatment process. This alloy is precipitation strengthened by gamma', and thus the control of size and distribution of gamma' precipitates is very important for practical applications. Precipitation behavior of gamma' in TMW-4M3 is strongly influenced by heat treatment conditions. Therefore, numerical simulation is useful for finding the most appropriate manufacturing condition prior to experimental trial and error approach. Firstly, we investigated the gamma' solvus temperature and improved several thermodynamic parameters of the conventional database to obtain reasonable phase boundaries between gamma/eta (Ni3Ti) and gamma/gamma'. Based on the new thermodynamic description, the nucleation rates related to temperature histories were calculated by using the CNT with composition balance equation under subsolvus solution treatment. Finally, the multi-phase-field method coupled with the CALPHAD approach and CNT model was applied to the microstructure evolution of intragranular secondary gamma' particles. The experimental and simulated microstructures show good agreement with each other. This method might be useful for microstructure evolution prediction of gamma/gamma' dual phase during the heat-treatment. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SO PHYSICA STATUS SOLIDI B-BASIC SOLID STATE PHYSICS
AB In this study, the growth and distribution of directional solidification (DS) dendrites in entire cross-sections of DS superalloy castings are simulated based on a modified shape function dendritic (MSFD) model coupled with the cellular automaton-finite difference (CA-FD) method. The macro-thermal transfer and columnar grain growth are calculated using CA-FD with a macro time-step, and then, the original and boundary conditions for the dendrite-growth simulation are determined via the interpolation of the macro temperature and the projection of the 3D preferential grain orientation using a matrix, M. The dendrite growth calculation cyclically proceeds based on the MSFD model. It is used to predict the growth of hundreds of dendrites throughout the cross-section of a DS casting by considering the macro-solidification parameters. The MSFD model is further applied to predict the competitive growth of DS dendrites and their distribution in the cross-sections of a spiral selector and a fake single crystal turbine blade. The results of the simulation correlate with the results of the DS experiment. Hence, the modified model coupled with the macro-simulation models can be used to predict the morphology and distribution of DS dendrites with respect to large-scale castings produced by the DS process.

All the tested alloys are active but passivable materials. The active state is characterised by a rapid dissolution of the constitutive elements of the alloy in the glass melt. The passive state can be obtained by an air oxidation of the alloys (called preoxidation) or with a temporary anodic polarisation of the alloy. The obtained passive state is due to the presence of a thin protective chromia scale. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB An analysis of the quality assurance systems applied in industry for an assessment of porosity in precision cast parts of aircraft engines has shown that they characterize with a lack of repeatability or reproducibility of the test results obtained. For this reason. a comprehensive procedure of porosity assessment has been developed. It has been shown in the research described here that the procedure guarantees obtaining an unambiguous, full characterization of porosity as well as accurate and repeatable test results.

TI Partition of alloying elements between gamma(L1(2)), eta(DO24), beta(B2)
   and H(L2(1)) phases in the Ni-Al-Ti base systems

AB Partitioning behaviour of alloying elements (V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, W, Hf, Zr, Mn, Fe, Co, Cu, Al, Si) between the gamma' (L1(2):Ni3Al), eta(DO24:Ni3Ti), beta(1)(B2: NiAl), beta(2)(B2: NiTi) and H(L2(1):Ni2AlTi) phases in the Ni-Al-Ti base systems at 1100 degrees C has been studied mainly by the diffusion couple method. It is confirmed that (1) in the cases of equilibria between the phases H and beta(1) and H and beta(2), the elements with large atomic size such as Ta, Nb and Hf prefer to partition to the Ti-rich H phase and, (2) in the cases of equilibria between the H, gamma' and eta phases, the bcc elements such as Zr, V and Cr prefer to concentrate into the H phase rather than into the gamma' or eta phases, and (3) in the case of equilibrium between the gamma' and the eta phases, the elements with a large atomic size such as Ta, Zr, W, Hf, Nb and Mo prefer to partition to the eta phase rather than to the gamma' phase. It is suggested that the size factor and the lattice stability of the component elements have a significant effect on the relative stability of these intermetallic phases. These data on the partition behaviour of alloying elements in the Ni-Al-Ti base system are likely to prove useful for alloy design involving Ni-base superalloys.

TI Degradation processes in high-temperature creep of cast cobalt-based
   superalloys
SO MATERIALS CHARACTERIZATION
AB Degradation processes in high-temperature creep of two cast high-chromium cobalt-based superalloys strengthened by niobium and tantalum for use in the glass industry were analysed via various experimental techniques. Constant load creep tests were conducted at 900, 950 and 1000 degrees C in a tensile stress range from 40 to 80 MPa. It was found that the CoNb superalloy possesses considerably longer creep life compared to the CoTa superalloy under the same loading conditions. Conversely, the creep ductility of the fractured specimens shows the opposite order of the creep life. The creep behaviour of both superalloys obeys the Monkman-Grant formula indicating that the creep deformation mechanism and fracture processes are mutually interlinked. The homogeneously distributed creep damage of the CoNb superalloy is closely connected with primary carbides and is predominantly initiated either as interface decohesion between the carbide/matrix and carbide eutectics/matrix or by breakage of bulk M23C6 carbides. The dominant type of creep damage in the CoTa superalloy is localized breakage of M23C6 carbides in close proximity of the fracture path. The final brittle fracture in the CoNb superalloy occurs via relatively fast propagation of the longest cracks after the ultimate state of damage is reached. Due to premature fracture, the inherent creep ductility of the CoNb matrix is not exhausted. The final ductile transgranular creep fracture of the CoTa superalloy is caused by a local strain-induced instability of the dislocation microstructure leading to a loss of an external section of specimen (necking).

TI Chromia-Assisted Decarburization of W-Rich Ni-Based Alloys in Impure
   Helium at 1273 K (1000 degrees C)
SO METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND
   MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB The microstructure and surface stability of two experimental W-rich Ni-based alloys have been studied at 1273 K (1000 A degrees C) in an impure-He environment containing only CO and CO2 as impurities. The alloy Ni-2.3Al-12Cr-12W contained 0.08 wt pct carbon in solution, whereas the second alloy Ni-2.3Al-3Mo-12Cr-12Co-12W contained M6C carbides at the same carbon level. Both alloys, which were preoxidized with similar to 2.3 mu m Cr2O3 layer, were decarburized completely within 50 hours of exposure to the helium gas mixture at 1273 K (1000 A degrees C) via the following chromia-assisted decarburization reaction: Cr2O3 (s) + 3C(alloy) (s) -> 2Cr (s) + 3CO (g). Microstructural observations, bulk carbon analysis, and microprobe measurements confirmed that the carbon in solid solution reacted with the surface chromium oxide resulting in the simultaneous loss of chromia and carbon. The Cr produced by the decomposition of the Cr2O3 diffused back into the alloy, whereas CO gas was released and detected by a gas chromatograph. Once the alloy carbon content was reduced to negligible levels, subsequent exposure led to the uninterrupted growth of Cr2O3 layer in both alloys. In the preoxidized alloys, chromia-assisted decarburization rates were slower for an alloy containing carbides compared with the alloy with carbon in solid solution only. The formation of Cr2O3 is shown to be the rate-limiting step in the chromia-assisted decarburization reaction. Exposure of as-fabricated alloys to the impure-He environment led to the formation of a thin layer of Al2O3 (< 1 mu m) between the substrate and surface Cr2O3 oxide that inhibited this decarburization process by acting as a diffusion barrier.

TI Effects of cyclic stress and temperature on oxidation damage of a
   nickel-based superalloy
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB Oxidation damage, combined with fatigue, is a concern for nickel-based superalloys utilised as disc rotors in high pressure compressor and turbine of aero-engines. A study has been carried out for a nickel-based alloy RR1000, which includes cyclic experiments at selected temperatures (700-800 degrees C) and microscopy examination using focused ion beam (FIB). The results suggest that the major mechanism of oxidation damage consists of the formation of surface oxide scales and internal micro-voids and oxide particles beneath the oxide scales, which become more severe with the increase of temperature. Applying a cyclic stress does not change the nature of oxidation damage but tends to enhance the extent of oxidation damage for temperatures at 750 degrees C and 800 degrees C. The influence of cyclic stress on oxidation damage appears to be insignificant at 700 degrees C, indicating a combined effect of cyclic stress and temperature. Further energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDXS) analyses show the enrichment of Cr and Ti, together with lower Ni and Co levels, in the surface oxide scales, suggesting the formation of brittle Cr2O3, TiO2, NiO and Co3O4 oxides on the specimen surface. Penetration of oxygen into the material and associated internal oxidation, which leads to further material embrittlement and associated failure, are evidenced from both secondary ion imaging and EDXS analyses.

TI Selection and evaluation of heat-resistant alloys for SOFC interconnect
   applications
SO JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Over the past several years, advances in the design and fabrication of planar solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) have led to a steady reduction in the temperatures necessary for their operation. Consequently, it appears more realistic now to use low cost heat-resistant alloys for interconnect components in the SOFC stack. However, no specific criteria or inclusive study are available as a reference to help select and evaluate suitable candidates from the hundreds of available heat-resistant alloy compositions, which overall demonstrate oxidation resistance at high temperatures. In this work, composition criteria have been proposed for the preselection of heat-resistant compositions, such as Ni-, Fe-, and Co-based superalloys, Cr-based alloys, and stainless steels. The proposed criteria have been employed to establish a database of heat-resistant alloys at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, where a systematic approach has been initiated to evaluate and modify and/or develop alloys for SOFC interconnect applications. The preselected compositions are further evaluated by referring in-house studies and reference to published data. It appears that it would be difficult for traditional alloys to fully satisfy the materials requirements for long-term operation at temperatures higher than 700degreesC. However, the applicability can be improved via surface/bulk modification and by the implementation of novel stack designs. (C) 2003 The Electrochemical Society.

AB The L21-structure Fe2AlTi intermetallic compound is one of the two phases identified in Fe-Al-Ti superalloy nanocomposites. Experimental data related to low-temperature magnetic properties of this Heusler compound indicate that magnetic moment is about 0.1 Bohr magneton per formula unit. In contrast, previous quantum-mechanical calculations predicted Fe2AlTi to have much higher magnetic moment, 0.9 Bohr magneton per formula unit. In order to solve this discrepancy between the theory and experiment we have performed a series of quantum-mechanical fix-spin-moment calculations and compared our results with those for non-magnetic state. It turns out that the total energy of the non-magnetic state is only by 10.73 meV/atom higher than that of the magnetic state. When applying Boltzmann statistics to this very small energy difference we predict that the non-magnetic state appears at non-zero temperatures with significant probabilities (for instance, 22.36 % at T = 100 K) and reduces the overall magnetic moment. As another mechanism lowering the magnetization we studied selected shape deformations, in particular trigonal shearing. Fe2AlTi exhibits a compression-tension asymmetry with respect to these strains and, for example, the strain epsilon=-0.08 destabilizes the spin-polarized state, leaving the non-magnetic state as the only stable one.

TI An investigation of corrosion resistance of HVOF coated ASME SA213 T91
   boiler steel in an actual boiler environment
SO ANTI-CORROSION METHODS AND MATERIALS
AB Purpose - This paper aims to use the high-velocity oxy fuel (HVOF) spraying process for depositing 93(WC-Cr3C2)-7Ni, 75Cr(3)C(2)-25NiCr, 83WC-17C(O) and 86WC-10C(O)-4Cr coatings on ASME SA213 T91 to study the corrosion resistance of these coatings in an actual boiler environment.
   Design/methodology/approach - The HVOF spraying process was used for depositing 93(WC-Cr3C2)-7Ni, 75Cr(3)C(2)-25NiCr, 83WC-17C(O) and 86WC-10C(O)-4Cr coatings on ASME SA213 T91. All the coatings obtained are found to be uniform, dense and having thickness between 200 and 250 mu m. All the coatings were exposed in an actual boiler environment at 900 degrees C temperature for 10 cycles. Each cycle consisted of 100 h heating followed by 1 h cooling at ambient conditions. X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive spectroscopy techniques were used to analyse corrosion products.
   Findings - All the coated samples were found to be having higher corrosion resistance than the uncoated samples. Among coated specimens, 93(WC-Cr3C2)-7Ni coating has shown maximum and 75Cr(3)C(2)-25NiCr coating has shown minimum resistance to corrosion.
   Originality/value - This paper is original research.

TI On microstructure and mechanical performance of AlCoCrFeMo0.5Nix
   high-entropy alloys
SO INTERMETALLICS
AB A high-entropy alloy system, AlCoCrFeMo0.5Nix, was designed based on the AlCoCrCuFeNi alloy, by replacing Cu with Mo in order to improve strength and thermal stability. Ni content was monitored to see its effect on microstructure and properties. The microstructure of AlCoCrFeMo0.5Nix alloys consists of B2, FCC, and sigma phase which are all multi-element solid solutions. As nickel content increases, the constituent phases change from B2 + sigma phases at x = 0 to B2 + FCC + sigma phases at x = 2.0, reflecting Ni is an FCC stabilizer. The room temperature hardness of the present alloy system decreases from Hv 904 at x = 0 to Hv 404 at x = 2.0. AlCoCrFeMo0.5Nix alloys with x = 0, 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 exhibit higher hot hardness level than that of Ni-based superalloys, In 718 and In 718 H. up to 1273 K. Furthermore, they possess the less negative value of softening coefficient (B-II) at high-temperature regime as compared with those of In 718, In 718 H, and T-800. This superiority can be explained with the slow diffusion rate of vacancies in the multi-element matrix. The present alloy system has great potential in high-temperature applications.

AB The fusion zone and heat affected zone (HAZ) microstructures of electron beam welded superalloy 718PLUS (TM) (718 Plus) that has been newly developed by ATI ALLVAC were examined. The microsegregation pattern during solidification of the fusion zone indicated that while Fe, Co, W, and Cr segregated to the core of the gamma dendrites, Nb, Ti, and Al were extensively rejected into the interdendritic liquid. Electron diffraction and X-ray microanalysis using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of the fusion zone showed that the major secondary phases that formed from the interdendritic liquid were gamma/MC type carbide eutectic and gamma/Laves eutectic constituents. HAZ microstructure showed partially melted zone immediately adjacent to the fusion zone and intergranular microfissuring associated with resolidified products which suggested that HAZ cracking in this alloy occurred by liquation cracking. Microstructural examination of the HAZ using analytical scanning electron microscope showed resolidified gamma/Laves eutectic on the cracked and backfilled grain boundaries. Fine resolidified MC type carbide particles were also observed in the HAZ. Causes of grain boundary liquation were identified and the solidification of intergranular liquid in the HAZ was discussed.

TI Effects of long-term thermal exposure on the microstructure and
   properties of a cast Ni-base superalloy
SO METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND
   MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Microstructural stability and microstructure-property relationship during long-term thermal exposure in K452 alloy (a new Ni-base cast superalloy with similar to 21 pct Cr, 11 pct Co, 3.5 pct W, 2.5 pct Al, 3.5 pct Ti, and others) are investigated. It is found that exposure temperature and time have significant effects on the microstructure and properties of the alloy. During exposure, the microstructure is degraded by gamma' coarsening, MC carbide (M mainly represents Ti. W, and Nb) degeneration, precipitation and evolution of grain interior (GI) M23C6 carbide, evolution of grain boundary (GB) microstructure, and precipitation of eta phase. Among them, the gamma' coarsening is the leading reason for the decrease of strength of the alloy. The GI M23C6 and the eta phase have negligible influence on the properties due to their relatively small populations. Blocky, closely spaced GB M23C6 particles engulfed in gamma' increase the stress-rupture life, whereas the formation of a continuous GB M23C6 chain has an opposite effect. A life peak occurs when the M23C6/gamma' structure at the GBs is in an optimal form. The degenerated MC is the preferred initiation site of microcracks. Its presence at the GBs promotes the onset of intergranular fracture; and leads to the decrease in mechanical properties.

AB With the goal of investigating the reported detrimental effect of water vapor on thermal barrier coating (TBC) performance, furnace cycle experiments were conducted in dry O-2 and air with 10 and 50% water vapor at 1100 degrees C. The TBC systems evaluated were air plasma-sprayed (APS), yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) top coatings with high velocity oxy fuel (HVOF)-deposited NiCoCrAlY or NiCoCrAlYHfSi bond coating. Average TBC lifetime was reduced by 30% in air with 10% water vapor compared to cycling in dry O-2, using 1 h cycle durations. Superalloy substrates with Y and La additions also were investigated but showed no statistical change in the average TBC lifetime compared to the base CMSX4 superalloy. In all cases, the bond coating with Hf and Si additions increased YSZ lifetime by 20% or more. Experiments that increased water vapor to 50% showed no further decrease in TBC lifetime. Increasing the cycle frequency to 100 h resulted in a large increase in TBC lifetime, especially for the NiCoCrAlYHfSi bond coatings. Co-doping the NiCoCrAl bond coat with Y and Hf was beneficial to TBC lifetime, but did not mitigate the detrimental impact of water vapor. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Modern aero engine turbine blades made of nickel-based superalloys are covered by thermal barrier coatings (TBC) for thermal and oxidation protection. A new generation of TBCs consist of a bond coat (thin layer of MCrAlY, where M may be Ni, Co, Fe) followed by a ceramic top coat of RE2Zr2O7 (RE - rare earth element). In this paper we present the possibility of the electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) method for characterisation of the microstructure and crystallographic orientation of a new TBC consisting of a Gd2Zr2O7 top coat and a NiFeCrAlY bond coat after long thermal exposure (1100 degrees C, 500 h). During thermal exposure, a thermally grown oxide (TGO) layer forms at the bond coat/top coat interface. The TGO is mainly composed of Al2O3. But, there is a possible reaction between Gd2Zr2O7 and Al2O3, leading to Gd-Al-O phases. Phase composition plays an important role in controlling the stress evolution, TGO deformation and crack propagation. Application of SEM-EDS-EBSD techniques allows direct characterisation of the chemical composition, phase composition and crystallographic orientation in the ceramic top coat and TGO layers. This paper presents the possibilities of using the EBSD method for phase identification (Gd2Zr2O7, spinel Ni(Al,Cr)(2)O-4, GdAlO3 and other phases) and orientation analysis of grains in the TGO layer.

TI On the superior hot hardness and softening resistance of
   AlCoCrxFeMo0.5Ni high-entropy alloys
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB Effects of Cr content on microstructures and hot hardness of AlCoCrxFeMo0.5Ni high-entropy alloys (x = 0-2.0) were investigated. The cast microstructure of AlCoCrxFeMo0.5Ni consists of B2 and if phases, both being multi-element solid solutions. Increasing Cr content increases the volume fraction of if phase and causes the matrix phase of the dendrite to change from B2 phase to if phase. The alloy hardness increases from Hv 601 at x = 0 to Hv 867 at x = 2.0 as a result of increasing amount of hard sigma phase. A phase diagram for the AlCoCrxFeMo0.5Ni alloy system is constructed based on SEM, HTXRD and DTA analyses, providing useful information for understanding and designing high-entropy alloys. All the AlCoCrxFeMo0.5Ni alloys possess higher hot-hardness level than that of Ni-based superalloys, In 718 and In 718 H, from room temperature to 1273 K. Cr-1.5 and Cr-2.0 alloys exhibit a transition temperature higher than that of Co-based alloy T-800 by about 200 K and have respective hardness values. Hv 374 and Hv 450 at 1273 K, being much higher than those, around Hv 127, of In 718 and In 718 H. The mechanism of larger strengthening and softening resistance is related with B2 and sigma phases, both having multi-principal-element effect. The AlCoCrxFeMo0.5Ni alloy system has a potential in high-temperature applications. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Microstructural homogenization and high-temperature cyclic oxidation
   behavior of a Ni-based super alloywith high-Cr content
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB A new Ni-based superalloy with high-Cr content was designed for industrial gas turbines application. The microstructural homogenization and high-temperature cyclic oxidation behavior was investigated systematically. The results showed that the optimum heat treatment condition was 1563 K (1290 degrees C)/4 h + 1573 K (1300 degrees C)/6 h, A. C. (air cooling) + 1393 K (1120 degrees C)/2 h, A. C. + 1143 K (870 degrees C)/24 h, A. C., which can completely dissolve the gamma/gamma' eutectic and the Ni-3(TiTa) phase in the interdendritic region. The cyclic oxidation results showed that a multilayer of continuous and dense oxide-rich regions formed and the kinetic curves followed a parabolic law. The mass gain at 1323 K (1050 degrees C) and 1343 K (1070 degrees C) was 4.02 mg/cm(2) and 4.23 mg/cm(2), respectively. No severe spallation of the oxide-rich region was observed. The outer layer of the oxide-rich region mainly consisted of Cr2O3, TiO2, and (Ni, Co) Cr2O4 spinels, while the layer at the substrate-oxide interface was found to be Al2O3. The results show that this new superalloy has a better cyclic oxidation resistance at 1343 K (1070 degrees C) than the commonly used IN738 and GTD-111 superalloys. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI A Comparative Study of the Corrosion Resistance of Incoloy MA 956 and PM
   2000 Superalloys
SO MATERIALS RESEARCH-IBERO-AMERICAN JOURNAL OF MATERIALS
AB Austenitic stainless steels, titanium and cobalt alloys are widely used as biomaterials. However, new medical devices require innovative materials with specific properties, depending on their application. The magnetic properties are among the properties of interest for some biomedical applications. However, due to the interaction of magnetic materials with Magnetic Resonance Image equipments they might used only as not fixed implants or for medical devices. The ferromagnetic superalloys, Incoloy MA 956 and PM 2000, produced by mechanical alloying, have similar chemical composition, high corrosion resistance and are used in high temperature applications. In this study, the corrosion resistance of these two ferritic superalloys was compared in a phosphate buffer solution. The electrochemical results showed that both superalloys are passive in this solution and the PM 2000 present a more protective passive film on it associated to higher impedances than the MA 956.

TI Influence of carbon content in cobalt-based superalloys on mechanical
   and wear properties
SO JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING MATERIALS AND TECHNOLOGY-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME
AB Two cobalt-based superalloys containing 1.6% and 2% carbon respectively were studied, with the emphasis on the influence of the carbon content on their microstructures, wear resistance, and mechanical properties. Phase formation and transformation in the microstructures were analyzed using metallographic, X-ray diffraction, and differential scanning calorimetry techniques. Wear resistance, tensile and fatigue behaviors of the alloys were investigated on a pin-on-disc tribometer MTS machine and rotating-bending machine, respectively. It is found that the wear resistance was increased significantly with the carbon content. The mechanical proper-ties of the alloys are also influenced by the carbon content, but the impact is not so significant as on the wear resistance. It was observed that the carbon content increased the yielding strength and fatigue strength, but decreased the fracture stress and fracture strain.

CY JUL 13-17, 2004
CL Singapore, SINGAPORE
AB The hot-section components in commercial aerogas turbines were typically made of nickel-based superalloys and were protected by coatings. Two kinds of diffusion aluminide coatings, including simple aluminide coating and NiCr-CrAl coating, were prepared on a nickel-based cast superalloy by LP-VCD and pack cementation techniques, respectively. The isothermal oxidation behavior of the cast alloy and the coatings at 1000 and 1100 degrees C and their hot corrosion behaviors in the presence of 75 wt.% Na2SO4+K2SO4 film at 900 degrees C were studied using TGA, scanning electron microscopy (SEM)/energy-dispersive spectrometry (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and electron probe microanalysis (EPMA), respectively. The results showed that NiCr-CrAl coating, not only held a very excellent oxidation resistance due to the alpha-Al2O3 formation on the coating surface during the isothermal process at 1000 and 1100 degrees C, but also possessed excellent hot corrosion resistance in sulphate melt. Internal oxidation and nitridation were found in the cast alloy during the oxidation process. Moreover, the cast alloy suffered from catastrophic hot corrosion, resulting in the serious internal oxidation and sulfidation. The oxidation resistance of the simple aluminide coating was superior to the cast alloy; the simple aluminide coating was damaged completely and lost its protective effect after the hot corrosion test. In addition, the mechanisms for oxidation and corrosion of the cast alloy and the coatings are discussed simultaneously. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Room temperature hardness, thermal dilatation and high temperature tensile strength have been studied in relation with these processes. Only the thermal dilatation coefficient and the modulus of elasticity are really affected by the evolution of the tantalum carbides.

TI Characterisation and oxidation of LVOF sprayed Al2O3-40TiO(2) coating on
   superalloys
SO SURFACE ENGINEERING
AB High temperature oxidation occurs in many equipments ranging from gas turbines, boilers, heat treating retorts to heat exchangers. Superalloys are used for such applications due to their excellent mechanical properties and creep resistance, but lack resistance to oxidation. In the present investigation, Al2O3-40TiO(2) coating has been deposited on nickel and cobalt based superalloys by low velocity oxyfuel (LVOF) process. The coating has been characterised for scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and surface roughness. The high temperature oxidation behaviour of coated and uncoated superalloys has been evaluated at 800 degrees C for 50 cycles of one hour duration. The LVOF coating has shown good adherence to the substrate. AE 435 superalloy has shown the highest weight gain amongst the tested materials, whereas Al2O3-40TiO(2) coated Superco 605 superalloy has shown the lowest weight gain. The better oxidation resistance of Al2O3-40TiO(2) coating might be attributed to the presence of protective Al2O3 phase along with TiO2 phase in it.

AB The precipitation of the lamellar-shaped M23C6 carbide within the dendritic matrix of a cobalt-base superalloy during thermal exposure at 1000 degrees C has been investigated. Such a precipitation is not commonly observed in cobalt-base superalloys. It is found that M23C6 particles nucleate preferentially at stacking faults (SFs) in the dendritic matrix and grow along the SFs to develop a lamellar character. Additionally, a Cr depletion zone is observed in the vicinity of the lamellar M23C6 carbide, which strongly supports the presence of Suzuki segregation.

AB Zn and Zn-Y coatings on 42CrMo steel were prepared by pack cementation process at 360 degrees C, 370 degrees C, 380 degrees C, 390 degrees C and 400 degrees C for 4 h, respectively. The purpose of this work was to comparatively study the differences on the microstructure and corrosion behavior between the two coatings. The relationship between the coating thickness and the temperature followed the linear rule. The Zn coating was continuous and had a single-layer structure. The Zn-Y coating exhibited a similar structure to the Zn-Fe coating. The Zn-Fe coating was a layer of Fe-Zn intermetallic compounds with increasing Fe3Zn10 concentration. YZn5 was formed with the addition of Y. The effect of Y addition on the microstructure and corrosion behavior of the Zn coating was discussed. The thickness of the Zn-Y coating was thicker than that of the Zn coating. The activation energy for the formation of the coating decreased with the addition of Y. The concentration of Fe3Zn10 phase in the Zn-Y coating was slightly higher than that in the Zn coating, which suggested that the addition of Y promoted the formation of the Fe3Zn10 phase. The immersion test showed that the addition of Y could improve the ability of the coating to resist the penetration of Cl- and O-2.

SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB Superalloys are extensively applied in the fields of energy industry. In the high parameter ultra-supercritical boiler used for coal-fired generation, superheater/reheater tubes must be made of superalloys which meet the requirement of good creep resistant, good fire-side corrosion resistant and steam-side oxidation resistant properties. In gas turbine engine used for gas power, turbine blades and guide vanes should be made of hot-corrosion resistant superalloys which must meet the requirements with respect to excellent high temperature corrosion resistance and long-term microstructural stability. In the field of nuclear power, heat exchange tubes used for steam generator require superalloys with excellent solution corrosion resistance. In the field of coal gasification and energy conservation and pollution reduction, the superalloys with excellent hot corrosion resistant and high temperature wear resistant properties are widely applied. In petroleum exploitation, especially in deep mining, drilling tools must be made of corrosion resistant and wear resistant superalloys because of the sour environment, the temperature of 4-150 degrees C and the existences of CO(2), H(2)S, sand and so on. This paper makes a brief introduction on the current situation of application and development of the superalloys at home and abroad in these fields.

Zn-Fe coatings on steel 45 were prepared at different temperatures (380 degrees C, 390 degrees C, 400 degrees C and 410 degrees C) by pack cementation process. The microstructure, formation mechanism and corrosion behavior of the Zn-Fe coatings were investigated. The Zn-Fe coating possessed a two-layered structure consisting of a thin diffusion layer and a thick outer layer. The coating thickness increased with the increase of the temperature. Zn-Fe-Y coating on steel 45 was prepared by the pack cementation process at 390 degrees C. The effect of Y addition on the microstructure and corrosion behavior of the Zn-Fe coating was studied. The structure of the Zn-Fe-Y coating was similar to that of the Zn-Fe coating. The coating thickness increased with the addition of Y. The activation energies for the formation of the Zn-Fe and the Zn-Fe-Y coatings were 82.31 kJ/ mol and 81.12 kJ/ mol, respectively. The corrosion resistance was measured by the immersion test and polarization test. The results showed that the corrosion resistance of the Zn- Fe coating firstly increased and then decreased with the increase of temperature. The Zn-Fe-Y coating had better corrosion resistance than the Zn-Fe coating.

TI INCONEL (R) alloy 783: An oxidation-resistant, low expansion superalloy
   for gas turbine applications
SO JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING FOR GAS TURBINES AND POWER-TRANSACTIONS OF THE
   ASME
CT 41st International Gas Turbine and Aeroengine Congress and Exhibition
CY JUN 10-13, 1996
CL BIRMINGHAM, ENGLAND
AB INCONEL(R) alloy 783 is art oxidation-resistant low coefficient of thermal expansion (low CTE) superalloy developed for gas turbine applications. Turbine efficiency can be increased through the use of low-CTE shrouds and case components that maintain tight blade tip clearances at different turbine operating temperatures. To achieve low CTE, alloys based on Ni-Fe-Co compositions require Cr content be maintained at low levels. Added Cr lowers the Curie temperature and thereby increases thermal expansion rate over a wider temperature range. The necessary lack of Cr minimizes resistance to both general oxidation and stress-accelerated grain boundary oxygen enhanced cracking (SAGBO). Increased amounts of Al in alloys strengthened by y' alone also promotes SAGBO. Alloy 783 is the culmination in the development of an alloy system with very high aluminum content that, in addition to forming y', causes beta aluminide phase precipitation in the austenitic matrix. It was discovered that this type of structure can be processed to resist both SAGBO and general oxidation, while providing low thermal expansion and useful mechanical properties up to 700 degrees C. The high Al content also reduces density to 5 percent below that of superalloys such as INCONEL alloy 718. Key aspects of the alloy development are presented, including the assessment of SAGBO resistance by evaluating elevated temperature crack growth in air The alloy, now commercially available, has been successfully fabricated and welded into gas turbine engine components.

TI Degradation behaviour and microstructural characterisation of

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MATERIALS & PRODUCT TECHNOLOGY
AB The present work investigated the cyclic high temperature degradation behaviour of high velocity oxy-fuel (HVOF) sprayed Cr3C2-NiCr coating deposited on 310S stainless steel (310S). The coated as well as uncoated specimens were exposed to molten salt (Na2SO4-60%V2O5) environment at 700 degrees C under cyclic conditions. The kinetics of hot corrosion was established using thermogravimetric technique. The corrosion products were characterised using the techniques such as X-ray diffraction, FE-SEM/EDAX and X-ray mapping for elucidating the corrosion mechanisms. The Cr3C2-25%NiCr coating was found to be successful in maintaining its continuous contact with the alloy substrate during cyclic degradation under simulated laboratory condition. HVOF sprayed Cr3C2-25% NiCr coating on 310S alloy substrate is found to be very effective in reducing the corrosion rate in the aggressive environment at 700 degrees C as observed from the present work. The oxide scales for Cr3C2-25% NiCr coated specimen were found to be intact and spallation-free. The parabolic rate constant of the coated specimen was lower than that of the bare specimen. The better hot corrosion resistance imparted by Cr3C2-NiCr coatings may be attributed to the formation of oxides of chromium, nickel and spinel of nickel and chromium.

TI Performance of high-velocity oxyfuel-sprayed coatings on an Fe-based
   superalloy in Na2SO4-60%V2O5 environment at 900 degrees C - Part I:
   Characterization of the coatings
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING AND PERFORMANCE
AB This article demonstrates the successful formulation of NiCrBSi, Cr3C2-NiCr, Ni-20Cr, and Stellite-6 coatings on an Fe-based superalloy by a high-velocity oxyfuel (HVOF) process for hot corrosion applications. The microstructure, porosity, coating thickness, phase formation, and microhardness properties of the coatings have been characterized using the combined techniques of optical microscopy, x-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive x-ray analysis. A microhardness tester was used to determine the hardness of the coatings. The coatings in general exhibit characteristic splat-like, layered morphologies due to the deposition and resolidification of successive molten or semimolten powder particles. The NiCrBSi, Cr3C2-NiCr, and Ni-20Cr coatings have shown a nickel-base face-centered cubic (fcc) structure as a principal phase, whereas Stellite-6 coating has an fcc Co-rich metallic matrix. Oxides/spinel oxides are formed in small fraction as intersplat lamellae or globules oriented parallel to the substrate surface. Coatings possess some unmelted/partially melted particles, inclusions, and porosity less than 2%. The microhardness of the coatings is found to be higher than the superalloys. The Cr3C2-NiCr coating has indicated a maximum microhardness of 990 Hv, while a Ni-20Cr coating has shown a minimum value of about 600 Hv. This article is focused on the characterization of HVOF coatings. The hot corrosion behavior of these coatings in a molten salt (Na2SO4-60%V2O5) environment at 900 degrees C under cyclic conditions is being presented as part II included in this issue.

TI Creep of face-centered-cubic {111} and {100} grains in FeCoNiCrMn and
   FeCoNiCrMn-Al alloys: Orientation and solid solution effects
SO INTERMETALLICS
AB In this study, creep behavior of the face-centered-cubic (FCC) {111} and (1001 grains in single-phase Fe20Co20Ni20Cr20Mn20 and dual-phase Fe(18)Co(18)Ni(20)Cr(18)Mn(18)A(18) high-entropy alloys (HEAs) was evaluated using a nanoindentation method over temperatures range of 300-600 degrees C. We measured the creep response of the two different grain orientations in the two alloys in order to study the orientation and solid-solution effects. Creep stress exponent (similar to 3.8-5.0) and activation energy (240-260 kJ/mol) were extracted and analyzed from stain rate-stress and stain rate-temperature data to provide information on the creep mechanism. The results indicated that creep was controlled by dislocation climb in both alloys at both orientations. However, we pointed out that, based upon activation energy value alone, it was difficult to identify which elemental constituent would be the dominant diffusing species responsible for vacancy diffusion during the climb. It was found that creep activation volume for the current two HEAs (140 angstrom(3) or similar to 12 Omega, where Omega is the atomic volume) at 600 degrees C is larger than that reported for the Ni-based superalloys (similar to 50-100 angstrom(3) or less) within a similar temperature range. The significance of this larger activation volume is also discussed.

TI Effect of modification by Pt and manufacturing processes on the
   microstructure of two NiCoCrAlYTa bond coatings intended for thermal
   barrier system applications
SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB Few studies have already shown that Pt influences the diffusion of aluminium and therefore the microstructure of beta-NiAl or gamma-Ni/gamma'-Ni(3)Al materials. Besides, several works have revealed that the addition of Pt to MCrAlY (M = Ni and/or Co) improves the oxidation/corrosion behavior of the material. Nevertheless, very few data have been published on the microstructure of such modified MCrAlYs. Then, the present work deals with the addition of Pt to two NiCoCrAlYTa coatings that differ by their manufacturing process. Characterization is carried out in order to understand the influence of Pt diffusion but also the effect of the manufacturing process on the final microstructure. The collected data from XRD, SEM. EDS and TEM analyses reveal that an Al uphill diffusion occurs during heat treatment due to the presence of the Pt layer. The Al diffusion from the NiCoCrAlYTa bulk to the Pt-rich surface is so extensive that no more beta-phase remains within the core of the coating. Pt may also dissolve TaC, precipitates largely present in the non-modified NiCoCrAlYTa coatings. In addition to Pt, the microstructure of the NiCoCrAlYTa prior to Pt deposition and heat treatment, dependent on the NiCoCrAlYTa manufacturing process, greatly influences the final microstructure.

TI Effect of microstructure on early oxidation of MCrAlY coatings
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB Two MCrAlY coatings with the same nominal composition, but different microstructures are deposited onto Hastelloy (R) X superalloy substrates by low-pressure plasma spraying (LPPS) and high velocity oxygen fuel (HVOF) spraying, respectively. The early oxidation behaviour of the coatings at 1150 degrees C is studied. For the LPPS coating with relative coarse grains, the gamma and beta-phase show different oxidation behaviours: the oxide on the gamma-phase shows a multi-layer structure, consisting of outer (Ni,Co) (Cr,Al)(2)O-4, intermediate (Cr,Al)(2)O-3 and inner alpha-Al2O3; the oxidation of the beta-phase, however, is characterised by selective oxidation of aluminium and the oxide is composed of a mixture of theta and alpha-Al2O3. a For the nanocrystalline HVOF coating, it does not show site-specific oxidation and the oxidation is characterised by formation of an exclusive alpha-Al2O3 scale over the surface. The microstructure-dependent oxidation is quantitatively described from the perspective of oxidation kinetics, with contribution from both lattice and grain boundary diffusion taken into consideration. A critical grain size of the gamma-phase, below which formation of an exclusive Al2O3 scale can be achieved, is predicted and verified. The study gives new insights into oxidation of MCrAlY coatings.

TI Hot corrosion behavior of HVOF-sprayed Cr3C2-WC-NiCoCrMo coating
SO CERAMICS INTERNATIONAL
AB A novel binary carbide-based sprayed powder, consisting of hard phases (Cr3C2, WC) and matrix phase (NiCoCrMo), was designed to ensure the harsh environments (corrosion, wear, and high temperature) of power plant boilers. A Cr3C2-WC-NiCoCrMo coating was deposited by high-velocity oxygen-fuel (HVOF) process using an agglomerated and sintered Cr3C2-WC-NiCoCrMo powder with a particle size of -45+15 mu m. Hot-corrosion tests were performed under cyclic conditions using a NaCl-KCI-Na2SO4 salt environment, at temperatures up to 500 degrees C. High-temperature oxidation was performed at 500 degrees C. For comparison, corrosion and oxidation tests were also performed on a commercial Cr3C2-25(NiCr) coating, and the corrosion resistance was evaluated by measuring the thickness of the corrosion scale. The properties of the specimens were characterized using X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive spectroscopy. The Cr3C2-WC-NiCoCrMo and Cr3C2-25(NiCr) coatings exhibited similar oxidation-resistance properties. The Cr3C2-WC-NiCoCrMo coating exhibited superior corrosion resistance to that of the Cr3C2-25(NiCr) coating. In the case of the Cr3C2-WC-NiCoCrMo coating, the thickness of the corrosion scale was approximately one-third that of the Cr3C2-25(NiCr) coating. The hot-corrosion resistance imparted by the Cr3C2-WC-NiCoCrMo coating may be attributed to the formation of alloy phases during the powder and coating manufacturing process, as well as to the formation of Cr, W, Ni, Co and Mo oxides, and Ni and Cr spinels.

SO TRANSACTIONS OF NONFERROUS METALS SOCIETY OF CHINA
AB Heavy duty engine valve head was prepared by Ni76Cr19AlTi alloy. It was coated by cobalt-base alloy on the surface to promote its wear-resistance. Hardness tester, metallograph, scanning microscopy, energy spectrum and X-ray diffraction were used to analyze the mechanical properties, the microstructure of the welds and the coated layer of cobalt-base alloy. The results show that the grains are obviously coasened in the side of Ni76Cr19AITi alloy in the welds and it contains a typical dentritic structure in the side cobalt-base alloy. It is found that micro-strain in weld is stronger than that in heat-effected-zone. Micro-strain in nickel-base alloy is stronger than that cobalt-base alloy. There are not obvious imperfects in the weld. Hardness in cobalt-base alloy is more than 390HV and the major carbides in cobalt-base alloy are Cr7C3 and W2C.

TI Intermediate temperature internal oxidation in fourth generation
   Ru-bearing single-crystal nickel-base superalloys
SO OXIDATION OF METALS
AB Fourth-generation, Ru-bearing, Ni-base superalloys offer superior microstructural stability over previous generations, affording greater density-corrected creep strength, but in common with their predecessors, have only borderline ability to form and maintain a protective oxide layer. This is particularly so at intermediate temperatures of around 750 degrees C at which temperature internal oxidation can occur. In this present study, the nature of this attack has been examined in experimental 3 and 5 mass % Ru alloys. Both these alloys exhibited dispersed regions of oxide-filled pits whose depth increased parabolically with isothermal exposure time at a similar rate. Pits appear to nucleate progressively straight from the initial competitive oxidation stage. In all cases, the pits were associated with a surface mound of nickel- and cobalt-rich oxides. The results of detailed metallographic examination of the internal oxidation products are provided.

CL Duksan, SOUTH KOREA
AB The development of new binder matrices and a fine hard phase have been studied in order to improve the properties of cermet material because TiC has a low stiffness and toughness at high temperature in spite of its high melting point, high hardness, oxidation and corrosion resistance, good thermal stability, and thermal shock resistance. Ni3Al intermetallics are great candidate binder matrices for some structural applications, especially those at the high temperature instead of Co or Ni. This permanently ordered compound up to its melting point has attracted wide interest since it is the prototype of one constituent phase of Ni-base superalloys strengthened by gamma'phase precipitation. This research focused on the fabrication of Ni3Al-Al2O3/TiC composite materials by spark plasma sintering. Raw powders of Ni, Al, TiH2 and activated carbon were milled in a planetary mill to fabricate Ni3Al-Al2O3/TiC cermet. These mixtured powders were consolidated by spark plasma sintering up to 1,350A degrees C in vacuum atmosphere under 10(-3) Torr. Ni3Al-Al2O3/TiC composite was directly synthesized by dehydrogenation and carburization reaction during sintering process. In situ sintered Ni3Al-Al2O3/TiC composite materials were formed by spark plasma sintering above 1,100A degrees C with 10-h milled powders. In the case of spark plasma sintering for 5 min at 1,350A degrees C, it indicated a hardness value of 71 HRC and a relative density of 94.6% through the influence of rapid densification and fine TiC particle reinforced Ni3Al-base composites materials.

TI Interaction between Re and W on the microstructural stability of
   Ni-based single-crystal superalloys
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The influences of Re and W as well as their interaction on gamma and topologically close-packed (TCP) phases have been investigated in seven kinds of Ni-based single-crystal superalloys. The results show that after full heat treatment, the gamma size is reduced with increasing Re, but does not change with increasing W. After thermal exposure at 1000 degrees C for 1000h, the TCP phase is dramatically increased with increasing Re, but increased slightly with increasing W. The TCP phase volume fraction in higher Re alloys is much more than that in lower Re alloys which have the same total content of Re and W. This indicates that W instead of Re could effectively improve the microstructural stability of Ni-based single-crystal superalloys.

AB Metallic materials used in the hottest parts of glass making machines are exposed to mechanical deformation, oxidation by different gases and hot corrosion by molten glass. Here the oxidation and corrosion behaviour of cobalt base superalloys are studied. The use of both thermogravimetry and electrochemical techniques allows a good and quantified knowledge about these properties. After a wide characterization of two reference alloys, this work focused on the influence of several parameters, which belong to either the chemical and microstructural ones or to the process ones. It has been done with the elaboration and the study of other alloys which differ from the references on the carbon, tantalum or tungsten contents, and by varying the time/temperature preoxidation couple or the glass/alloy relative movement. For example, it appeared that high contents of carbon or heavy elements lead to a faster oxidation, and all alloys can get a passive state if preoxidised during a sufficient time that depends on the temperature.

AB Dislocation structures in monocrystalline nickel-based superalloys DD8, ZS26 and a directionally solidified cobalt-based superalloy under tensile and fatigue loading are reviewed. An investigation of dislocation structure in DD8 during fatigue loading at 760 degrees C was conducted. Dislocation bands and three-dimensional networks were found in the matrix, Most of the dislocations observed in the gamma'-phase were in the form of superdislocations. The superimposition of the cyclic component to the process of creep resulted in a minor effect on lifetime of single crystal nickel-based superalloy ZS26. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) reveals different mechanisms of dislocation-gamma' precipitate interaction under various loading conditions. In addition, TEM in-situ investigation of dislocation behaviour at the crack tip in single crystal nickel-based superalloy DD8 was carried out. Dislocation free zone (DFZ) ahead of the crack tip was frequently observed and affected by the nearby gamma/gamma' interfaces. The defects induced by cyclic straining in the single crystal cobalt-based superalloy are mainly characterized by stacking faults and their intersections.

TI Sliding wear of various materials in molten zinc
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB A full journal bearing tester was built to study wear behaviour of materials sliding in molten zinc. Various material combinations, including cobalt based superalloys, cermet coatings (on 316L stainless steel substrates), and ceramics were evaluated at conditions similar to continuous galvanising line (CGL) operations. Metallographic and chemical analyses were conducted on tested specimens to characterise the wear. Cobalt based superalloys not only suffered considerable wear but also reacted with molten zinc to form intermetallic compounds. Cermet coatings and ceramics experienced noticeable wear although they were non-wettable and did not react with zinc baths. The study showed that MgO stabilised ZrO2 suffered the most wear when running against laser clad WC coated 316L while the combination of SiAION and laser clad WC coated 316L showed the least amount of wear. The composite nature of hard particles imbedded in a soft matrix, posing resistance against. both abrasive and surface fatigue wear, is believed to be the reason that laser clad WC coatings can withstand wear in molten zinc.

TI MICROSTRUCTURAL CHARACTERIZATION OF WELDING ON A COBALT BASE SUPERALLOY
SO ACTA MICROSCOPICA
AB Cobalt base superalloys are widely used in the aerospace industry, specifically in the combustion chamber of high-power turbines, it presents greater weldability when compared with other superalloys, however it is necessary to find optimal conditions in the welding process for high resistance. This work aims to study the effect of shielding gas on the microstructure and hardness in the welding of a cobalt base superalloy, through the process Tungsten Inert Gas (TIG). We used the argon shielding gas and the mixture argon-20% CO2, and as filler alloy Hastelloy X. The analysis of the microstructural characteristics of welded joints was performed using optical microscopy (OM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), where he noted that the solidification structure in the center of the weld-dendritic cells and the interfacial weld metal-base columnar dendritic. Hardness testing of welded plates, was performed on the base metal interface and center of the weld, using the Vickers hardness test, this showed that the hardness decreases for both shielding gases from the base metal to center of the weld, which is attributed to the possible dissolution of carbides in the W-Cr welding process. It was determined that the welds with argon as protective gas, have the most beneficial conditions for TIG welding, as this gives a more homogeneous microstructure, higher hardness and less microporosity.

TI The development of new bond coat compositions for thermal barrier
   coating systems operating under industrial gas turbine conditions
SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB Environmental and economic issues are driving the development of increasingly efficient gas turbines. An important step in achieving this is to engineer components which can operate with longer lifetimes and at higher metal temperatures. Inlet temperatures for gas turbines now exceed the melting temperatures of nickel-based superalloys (i.e. 1300-1350 degrees C). The use of advanced air cooling systems coupled with thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) reduces the temperature of the underlying superalloy substrate. The bond coating, an important part of the TBC system, oxidizes to form a slow growing protective oxide layer, while also providing adhesion between the ceramic topcoat and the substrate. NiCoCrAlY overlay coatings are some of the most commonly used bond coatings for industrial gas turbines and extensive research has been undertaken over many years to find the best bond coating composition.
   This paper reports upon the production of new, model bond coatings with a wide range of different compositions. The focus is on their oxidation behavior at a temperature typically experienced by bond coatings on industrial turbine blades (950 degrees C). A physical vapor deposition technique, magnetron sputtering, has been used to deposit a range of Ni-Co-Cr-Al coatings onto 10 mm diameter sapphire substrates. This was achieved through co-sputtering two targets: a Ni-10%Cr, Ni-20%Cr, Ni-50%Cr, Ni-20%Co-40%Cr or Ni-40%Co-20%Cr target and a pure Al target. About a hundred samples with varying compositions were produced by this method. The coatings were then oxidized in air for 500 h at 950 degrees C.
   All samples were assessed by measuring the change in coating thickness, using pre- and post-exposure metrology only, and also the change in specimen weight. This approach has shown that magnetron sputtering successfully deposited 20 to 30 mu m thick coatings and allowed the calculation of oxide growth rates. Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis was used to characterize the exact composition of each sample. Additionally, Xray diffraction (XRD) has been used to identify the major oxides formed during exposure. The selective growth of protective Cr2O3 or Al2O3 or other less protective mixed oxides (depending on the initial coating composition) was observed. This influenced the oxide scale growth rate, indicating which coatings produced more protective oxides and allowing future optimization of the bond coating composition, for service within the turbine section of industrial gas turbines to be planned.

SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Up to now gamma' phase in superalloys is always analyzed in electrolytes with oxygen-hearing anion in transpassive dissolution potential range. It is based on the difference of transpassive behavior between 'gamma' phase and gamma matrix, which is caused from the difference of chromium contents between toth phases. So the electrolytic extraction of gamma' phase from chromium-free superalloys by traditional methods is very difficult. In this paper, a new galvanostatic electrolysis method is developed succesefully for the quantitative extraction of gamma' phase from the 10% NH4Cl + 2% citric acid solution in active dissolution range[about- 200 mV(SCE)].

In this paper, domestic progress of wrought superalloys in recent ten years was reviewed, including advances in fabrication process, research in new alloys (GH4169G, GH4169D, GH4065 and GH4068 alloy et al.) and new techniques (deforming of FGH4096 alloy, nitriding of NGH5011 alloy and 3D printing of In718 alloy et al.).

TI Preparation and Structure of Al plus Si Codeposited Coatings on.
   Ni-based Superalloys
SO RARE METAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING
AB The Al+Si codeposited coatings were prepared on DZ417G superalloy substrates by aluminization and siliconization using pack cementation. XRD, SEM and EDS were used to study the microstructure and morphology of coatings. The results show that during the co-deposition process, the structure formed on the coating surface changes with the change of Al and Si contents. In addition, the post heat-treatment also has an effect on the structure of coatings. When the composition (in wt%) of the packs is XAl-4NH(4)Cl-4Si-(92-X)Al2O3 (X= I, 4 and 6), the corresponding structures of the coatings are NiSi and Ni2Al3 after pack cementation, respectively. When Si content increases to 6 wt% and 10 wt%, the structure of the coatings is also NiSi or Ni2Al3. After post heat-treatment, because of Ni, Cr and Mo diffusion from the substrate, NiSi transforms to AlNi6Si3 or S-Ni2Si, while Ni2Al3 transforms to beta-NiAl. The Si level in the beta-NiAl coatings is very small. Cr or Mo dissolves into AlNi6Si3, delta-Ni2Si and beta-NiAl. Al content plays a role in the formations of coatings. When Al content is low in the pack, the structure of coatings is NiSi after Al + Si codeposition. However, when the Al content is above 4 wt%, the structures of coatings are Ni2Al3 after pack cementation. Cr-rich AlNi6Si3, Cr- and Mo-rich delta-Ni2Si as well as beta-NiAl coatings are formed after Al + Si codeposition followed by post heat-treatment.

SO METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND
   MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Ni-based alloys with high Cr contents are not only known for their excellent high temperature and hot corrosion resistance, but are also known for poor mechanical properties and difficult workability. Powder metallurgical (PM) manufacturing of alloys may overcome several of the shortcomings encountered in materials manufacturing involving solidification. In the present work, six PM Ni-based alloys containing 35 to 45 wt pct Cr and 3.5 to 6 wt pct Nb were produced and compacted via hot isostatic pressing. Samples were heat treated for up to 1656 hours at either 923 K or 973 K (650 A degrees C or 700 A degrees C), and the microstructures and mechanical properties were quantified and compared to thermodynamic calculations. For the majority of the investigated alloys, the high Cr and Nb contents caused development of primary populations of globular alpha-Cr and delta (Ni3Nb). Transmission electron microscopy of selected alloys confirmed the additional presence of metastable gamma aEuro(3) (Ni3Nb). A co-dependent growth morphology was found, where the preferred growth direction of gamma aEuro(3), the {001} planes of gamma-Ni, caused precipitates of both alpha-Cr and delta to appear in the form of mutually perpendicular oriented disks or plates. Solution heat treatment at 1373 K (1100 A degrees C) followed by aging at 973 K (700 A degrees C) produced a significant strength increase for all alloys, and an aged yield strength of 990 MPa combined with an elongation of 21 pct is documented for Ni 40 wt pct Cr 3.5 wt pct Nb.

AB Alloy 903 and Alloy 909 are well-known Fe-Co-Ni-Al-Ti-Nb alloys with controlled low thermal expansion, but they have some properties that can be improved. To improve stress-accelerated grain boundary oxidation embrittlement of Alloy 903 and instability of the gamma' phase of alloy 909, two new alloys with good stress-rupture ductility, high creep-rupture strength, high tensile strength at high temperature, and good controlled thermal expansion were developed. These property improvements were accomplished by the combination of optimizing the Fe-Co-Ni ratio of the matrix and stabilizing the gamma' phase with the addition of aluminum.

TI When a defect is a pathway to improve stability: a case study of the
   L1(2) Co3TM superlattice intrinsic stacking fault
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Effect of solutes of transition metals (TM = Cr, Fe, Hf, Mn, Mo, Nb, Ni, Pt, Rh, Ru, Re, Ta, Ti, V, W, Y and Zr) on the local phase transition between the L1(2) and D0(19) structures in superlattice intrinsic stacking fault (SISF) of Co3TM has been investigated. All the models employed herein, i.e. (1) the SISF-containing supercell, (2) the axial nearest-neighbor Ising (ANNI) model, and (3) both the L1(2)- and D0(19)-containing (L1(2) + D0(19)) supercell, yield the same result regarding the stability of SISF in L1(2)-type Co3TM. In the view of bonding charge density, the atomic and electronic basis of local D0(19) phase transition in the SISF fault layers of Co3TM are revealed. Especially, the negative SISF energy predicted by the L1(2) + D0(19) model suggests that both the SISF fault layers (i.e. the local D0(19) structure) and the L12 phase of Co3TM can be stabilized through a coupling interaction between the fault layers and the solutes, paving a pathway to stabilize Co-base superalloys via Co3TM precipitate. Moreover, the consist results of E-SISF via the ANNI model with the classical SISF-supercell method utilized in first-principles calculations supports the approach to efficiently distinguish various planar faults and predict their corresponding energies, such as SISF, superlattice intrinsic stacking fault, anti-phase boundaries, and so on.

AB Thermal Barrier Coatings (TBCs) are used as insulators on hot section components to reduce operating temperatures in aircraft engines and industrial gas turbine. The TBC system consists of two layers: the ceramic top coat traditionally Yttria Stabilized Zirconia (YSZ) with a low conductivity, and the bond coat generally MCrAlY, M=Ni and/or Cr or Co or Pd or Pt modified aluminides. In the industry, two dry-route processes used to deposit TBCs give quite different microstructures of coatings. In one hand, coatings resulted by plasma spraying (PS) present a lamellar microstruture with a low thermal conductivity in the range from 0.7 to 0.9 Wm(-1)K(-1). In the other hand, Electron Beam Physical Vapour Deposition (EBPVD) coatings with columnar microstruture coatings present the best mechanical performances but perpendicular orientation of the columns makes their thermal conductivity twice higher compared to PS coatings. The present study proposes the elaboration of zirconia coatings via the sol-gel route combined with dip-coating process. It is a versatile process able to produce either thin ceramic coatings or thick deposits. The main advantage of this method is to decrease the crystallization temperature, much lower than conventional processes. Moreover, the sol-gel process is a nondirectional deposition technique, which is very different to the physical methods described above. Doped zirconia have been chosen to constitute isolating multilayers coatings. Sol formulation, slurries stability but also dip-coating conditions have been optimized in order to obtain homogeneous layers on nickel based superalloys substrates.

TI Low Cycle Fatigue Life Evaluation for Cobalt-Based Superalloy FSX-414
SO TRANSACTIONS OF THE KOREAN SOCIETY OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS A
AB Components of gas turbines need to be extremely resistant to elevated temperatures and stresses, corrosion, and erosive environments. The materials used under these environmental conditions are primarily cobalt-based superalloys. In this study, the low cycle fatigue of a cobalt-based superalloy, FSX-414, was examined. The total strain ranges of a gas turbine operating between 760 degrees C and 870 degrees C were considered the parameters representing actual gas turbine operation. In addition, fatigue tests were performed using a trapezoidal waveform to reflect the operation and stop conditions of a gas turbine with frequent shutdowns. The fatigue test results were compared with results obtained using the Manson-Coffin method and the energy method. The fractured surface was analyzed using a scanning electron microscope(SEM).

AB This paper investigates the beta-phase coarsening behaviour during isothermal heat treatment of freestanding CoNiCrAlY (Co-31.7%Ni-20.8%Cr-8.1%Al-0.5%Y, all in wt%) coatings prepared by high velocity oxy-fuel (HVOF) thermal spraying. The microstructure of the coatings was characterised using scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD). It comprises a two phase structure of fcc gamma-Ni matrix and bcc beta-NiAl precipitates. The volume fraction of the gamma-Ni and the beta-NiAl phases were measured to be around 70% and 30% respectively, with grain sizes varying largely from 0.5 to 2 mu m for both phases. Isothermal heat treatments of the freestanding coatings were carried out at 1100 degrees C for times up to 250 h. The beta-phase coarsening behaviour during isothermal heat treatments was analysed by quantitative metallography. It is shown that the coarsening behaviour of beta phase in the CoNiCrAlY alloy followed the classical Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner (LSW) theory of Ostwald ripening. By incorporating a dimensionless factor Which correlates with volume fraction of the beta phase, a modified LSW model coupled with formulaic interfacial energy and effective diffusion coefficient of the CoNiCrAlY alloy was utilised to interpret the coarsening behaviour of the beta phase. The coarsening rate coefficient obtained from the modified LSW model shows good agreement with the corresponding experimental result. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The main results obtained are summarized as follows:
   (1) When the TMP-3 superalloy was sufficiently agitated at 70 s-1 from the start of solidification, the dendrite structure was broken up and equiaxed grain structure with the average primary solid particle size of 65 +/- 15-mu-m was formed.
   (2) The distributions of Ni, Cr, Co, Al, Ti, Mo, Nb, W, P and C in the superalloy TMP-3 ingots rheocast at 70 s-1 and stationarily cast were measured by using a computer-aided microanalyzer (CMA). The concentrations of main eight metallic elements in the center of equiaxed grains in the rheocast alloy were almost equal to those in the center of dendrites in the stationary cast alloy.
   (3) It was observed from the measurement of the distribution of Ti and Al that the size of gamma' phases in the rheocast alloy tend to decrease as compared with that in the stationarily cast one.
   (4) It was observed that granular MC carbides containing mainly Nb, Ti and Mo precipitate uniformly along the grain boundary in the rheocast alloy, although the plate-like MC carbides precipitate in the grain boundary of the stationary cast alloy.
   (5) The distribution of P measured by CMA showed that P segregates considerably in the grain boundary, but the degree of phosphorous segregation in the rheocast alloy tend to decrease as compared with that in the stationary cast one.

SO JOURNAL OF TOXICOLOGY-CLINICAL TOXICOLOGY
AB Cobalt is a relatively rare magnetic element with properties similar to iron and nickel. The two valance states are cobaltous (II) and cobaltic (III) and the former is the most common valance used in the chemical industry. Cobalt occurs in nature primarily as arsenides, oxides, and sulfides. Most of the production of cobalt involves the metallic form used in the formation of cobalt superalloys. The term "hard metal" refers to compounds containing tungsten carbide (80-95 %) combined with matrices formed from cobalt (5-20%) and nickel (0-5 %). For the general population, the diet is the main source of exposure to cobalt. In the occupational setting, exposure to cobalt alone occurs primarily during the production of cobalt powders. In other industrial exposures (e.g., hard metal, diamond polishing), additional agents (tungsten) modulate the toxicity of cobalt. Cobalt is an essential element necessary for the formation of vitamin B-12 (hydroxocobalamin); however, excessive administration of this trace element produces goiter and reduced thyroid activity. In 1966, the syndrome "beer drinker's cardiomyopathy" appeared in Quebec City, Canada, and was characterized by pericardial effusion, elevated hemoglobin concentrations, and congestive heart failure. An interstitial pulmonary fibrosis has been associated with industrial exposure to hard metal dust (tungsten and cobalt), but not to cobalt alone. Exposure to cobalt alone produces an allergic contact dermatitis and occupational asthma. Treatment of cobalt toxicity is primarily supportive.

Estimating parameters like dislocation density and carbide spacing by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). the hot tensile, creep and relaxation behaviour has been connected with the evolution of microstructure.

The deterioration in the creep properties of the alloy NiCr22Co12Mo9 as a result of coating was a result both of the degraded state of the M23C6-precipitate in the substrate metal, and of the weakening of the solid solution- and precipitation hardening mechanisms responsible for the creep strength of the material. in the region of the boundary surface.

AB High speed machining is known as an advanced machining process increasingly used for modern materials such as nickel or cobalt based superalloys. Besides increasing productivity and accuracy, high cutting speed will also improve surface quality. This paper outlines modeling methodology applied to optimize cutting parameters during high speed milling in order to obtain a very good surface finish. The parameters taken into account were cutting speed, ming feed and axial depth of the cut. These parameters are easy to controll and improvements can be made without mosts, simply by setting them at optimal values. For economic reasons, in order to solve the problem with minimum umber of trials, a centered composite experiment design was used. Experiment results of surface roughness measurements after high speed end milling of cobalt based superalloy FSX 414 with Ti coated carbide tools are resented. A predictive model was obtained after analyzing with ANOVA the influence of cutting parameters on surface roughness. The predictive model - well correlated with experimental data- shows that surface roughness does not depend on axial depth and is mostly influenced by feed rate. Cutting speed must be increased and cutting feed decreased to obtain a lower surface roughness Ra.

SO CALPHAD-COMPUTER COUPLING OF PHASE DIAGRAMS AND THERMOCHEMISTRY
AB Microstructure phenomena resulting from high temperature oxidation of a simple nickel alloy and two cobalt-base superalloys were studied by rnicrostructure examinations and thermodynamic calculations. The latter allowed to better quantify what happened to carbon during oxidation, which was not possible with microstructure examination and microanalysis alone, and to explain the microstructure changes due to oxidation. At 1000 degreesC, due to the Cr oxidation, the grain boundary carbides dissolve and the carbon diffuses inwards, where new carbides form. However, at 1100 and 1200 degreesC, the carbon diffuses outwards to the surface. Thermodynamic calculations were used to explain the seemingly different mechanisms of carbon diffusion.

TI Oxidation mechanism of cobalt based alloy at high temperatures (800-1100
   degrees C)
SO CORROSION ENGINEERING SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB A cobalt based Phynox alloy has been oxidised in the 800-1100 degrees C temperature range. Kinetic results show that the parabolic behaviour is followed under isothermal conditions. The scale growth mechanism of cobalt based Phynox alloy in air is consistent with a growth mechanism limited by the diffusion process in a growing Cr2O3 oxide scale. Thermal cycling tests show that the best scale adherence is found at 1000 degrees C. This temperature permits a rapid chromium supply from the substrate to form a continuous chromia scale. A keying effect at the internal interface is promoted by the presence of silicon and molybdenum. At 900 degrees C, CoCr2O4 cobalt containing oxide formation is favoured and leads to a bad scale adherence. At 1100 degrees C, thermal cycling conditions lead to scale spallation and chromium depletion. Then, important weight losses are registered corresponding to the oxidation of cobalt and molybdenum to induce CoCr2O4 and CoMoO4 formation.

TI Influence of hot isostatic pressing on the fracture transitions in the
   fine grain MAR-M247 superalloys
SO MATERIALS CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
AB The application of hot isostatic pressing (HIP) on the fine grain MAR-M247 superalloys was investigated for obtaining superior mechanical behaviors. The as-cast samples with grain sizes ranging from 70 to 90 mum were prepared using the fine grain process by varying overheating casting temperatures. Part of test bars was preceded with HIP for comparison. The tensile tests were carried out at elevated temperatures and the fracture morphologies were observed using scanning electron microscopy. The experimental results show that the tensile strengths and elongations of the as-cast fine grain MAR-M247 superalloys are deteriorated due to the presence of microporosity resulting from the liquid metal solidification and contraction. The microporosity can be eliminated by HIP and the tensile strengths and elongations are significantly improved. Nevertheless, the yield strengths of the fine grain MAR-M247 superalloys after HIP decreases because of the formation of coarsened gamma' phase at high temperature and high pressure during HIP. On the other hand, the mechanical behaviors at elevated temperatures are degraded due to the growth of gamma' precipitates around 760degreesC. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Low Temperature Hot Corrosion Screening of Single Crystal Superalloys
SO MATERIALS
AB Single crystal superalloys were screened in Type II molten (Na,K)-sulfate hot corrosion re-coat tests in air +300 ppm SO2 at 700 degrees C. They exhibited large 20-40 mg/cm(2) weight changes, repeated spallation, and non-protective, 25-50 m thick corrosion layers after 300 h of testing. Scale cross sections revealed dual outer Ni(Co)O and inner Al(Cr)S-rich corrosion layers. This chemical differentiation was partially consistent with previous models of oxide fluxing, alloy sulfidation, NiO micro-channel diffusion, and synergistic dissolution mechanisms. Broad shallow pits or uniform attack morphologies were consistent with prior studies performed in high >100 ppm pSO(2) environments. Higher Mo experimental alloys trended toward more degradation, producing 100 m thick scales with distinct Al(Cr)S-rich inner layers or 500 m thick NiO. The aggressive behavior in these environments supports the need for LTHC-resistant coatings for single crystal superalloys.

CT European Symposium on Superalloys and their Applications
CY MAY 25-28, 2010
CL Wildbad Kreuth, GERMANY
AB The enhancement of efficiency in gas turbine engines requires the development of new superalloys capable of withstanding higher temperatures. The development of novel industrial cast and wrought (C&W) disk alloys with required combination of strength, creep and fatigue resistances at 700 degrees C is particularly desired due to the expensive cost of powder metallurgy. In this context, new C&W disk alloys were recently developed to fulfill these requirements. TMW4 shows higher properties than the current C&W disk alloy despite an expensive cost due to its high cobalt content, where as 718Plus presents a moderate cost with restricted creep properties at 700 degrees C compared to the current U720Li disk alloy. The new nickel base superalloys developed by Aubert & Duval were therefore designed to offer a better compromise between high temperature properties at 700 degrees C and cost. This paper describes the alloy metallurgical features and is especially focused on the alloy design which is extensively based on phase diagram modeling. The study was firstly carried out on small ingots of 6 kg to optimize the chemistry before forging 200 kg ingots by industrial processes. The ability to be processed by the conventional cast & wrought route and the control of the highly expensive elements contents confer to the alloys an attractive cost comparable to that of 718Plus alloy. The high amount of gamma' and the molybdenum-tungsten levels insure higher creep and tensile properties than those obtained with 718Plus.

TI Improving the hot corrosion resistance of boiler tube steels by
   detonation gun sprayed coatings in actual boiler of thermal power plant
SO ANTI-CORROSION METHODS AND MATERIALS
AB Purpose This paper aims to investigate the hot corrosion behavior of Ni-Cr and Cr3C2-NiCr coatings, deposited on T11, P91 boiler steels by detonation gun spray coating (D-Gun) process to enhance high temperature corrosion resistance. Design/methodology/approach Hot corrosion studies were conducted in secondary super heater zone of boiler at 900 degrees C for 10 cycles on bare and D-Gun coated steel specimens. The microhardness and porosity values of as-sprayed coatings were measured before exposing the specimens in the boiler environment. Each cycle consisted 100 h of heating in the boiler environment followed by 20 min of cooling in air. The weight change measurements were performed after each cycle to establish the kinetics of corrosion using thermogravimetric technique. X-ray diffraction, SEM techniques were used to analyze the corroded specimens. Findings Uncoated boiler steel experienced higher weight loss. The Cr3C2-NiCr coating was found to be more protective than Ni-Cr coating. The phases revealed the formation of oxide scale on coated specimens, mainly consist of nickel and chromium, which are reported to be protective against the hot corrosion. Originality/value There is very limited reported literature on hot corrosion behavior of Ni-Cr and Cr3C2-NiCr coatings deposited on the T11 and P91 substrates by detonation gun (D-gun) spray technique. T11 and P91 alloy steels have been chosen for this study because these two alloys are used to manufacture boiler tubes used in Indian thermal power plants.

TI Atomic-scale observation and analysis of chemical ordering in M3B2 and
   M5B3 borides
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB Secondary phases precipitated in diffusion affected zones (DAZs) of a transient liquid phase (Tip) bonded Ni-based superalloy have a large impact on materials properties. Here we report an atomic-scale analysis of the crystal structures and elemental distributions within DAZ precipitates in a TLP-bonded single-crystal superalloy using a range of electron microscopy techniques. The predominant precipitate phases are found to be M3B2- and M5B3-type borides, where M is a mixture of transition metal elements. Atomically-resolved energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy in an aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) enabled the distributions of metal atoms within the precipitates to be determined. The observation that different metals occupy preferred sites within the crystals indicates that these phases are not uniform solid solutions, but instead are chemically ordered. Both borides contain two distinct metal lattice sites such that the phases can be described as L2SB2 and L4SB3, where L and S are elements with larger (e.g., W, Mo) and smaller (e.g., Cr, Co, Ni) atomic numbers, respectively. Ordering of W and Cr is found to be particularly strong. A systematic search for stable phases within the chemical space of the W-Cr-B ternary system using the crystal structure prediction (CSP) program USPEX provided further insights into the nature of the observed chemical ordering. This combination of STEM and CSP techniques provides a direct and robust way of determining chemical features and local structures of multicomponent phases with atomic resolution even when particle sizes are too small for analysis using conventional methods.

TI The Intrinsic Relationship Between Microstructure Evolution and Thermal
   Fatigue Behavior of a Single-Crystal Cobalt-Base Superalloy
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA-ENGLISH LETTERS
AB The intrinsic relationship between the microstructure evolution and thermal fatigue behavior of a single-crystal cobalt-base superalloy has been investigated. The thermal fatigue tests are performed cyclically between room temperature and 1050 degrees C using V-notch plate specimens. Three states of thermal fatigue specimens are selected: the as-cast, solutionized as well as aged states. The solution treatment is carried out at 1260 degrees C for 24 h, which results in the dissolution of most of interdendritic continuous primary carbides. The subsequent aging treatment is carried out at 1100 degrees C for 100 h after solution treatment, resulting in the precipitation of a profusion of chain- and point-like M23C6 carbides in the matrix. The results indicate that the heat treatment can improve the thermal fatigue properties of the alloy and the effect of the solution treatment is more prominent than that of the aging treatment. The coarse and continuously distributed primary carbides in the as-cast state are changed into small and discontinuous distribution by heat treatment, which is the dominant factor in the improvement of thermal fatigue property. Additionally, the effect of oxidation behavior during thermal fatigue test on the thermal fatigue behavior is also studied.

TI Carbide tool wear mechanism in turning of Inconel 718 superalloy
SO WEAR
AB Wear surfaces of the cutting tools are analyzed to study the wear mechanism of cemented carbide tools in turning of Inconel 718 superalloys. SEM and EPMA analyses indicated that the wear of carbide tools during high speed turning condition (V = 35 m min (-1)) was caused by diffusion of elements (Ni or Fe) in workpiece into tool's binder (Co) by a grain boundary diffusion mechanism. This action weakened the bonding strength between carbide particles (WC, TiC, TaC) and the binder (Co). The carbide particles were then detached out of the cemented carbide tool by high flow stresses. The proposed grain boundary diffusion mechanism is also confirmed by theoretical analysis.

AB Due to high strength and ductility, AISI 4141 alloy steel is widely used in many industrial applications, such as gears and blades. When it is composed to harsh working environment, severe mechanical failures may happen. In order to save the high added value of the components, necessary repairing techniques are required to recover their functionality. Laser Engineered Net Shaping (LENS) is an innovative technology for metal parts repairing and rebuilding due to its metallurgical bonding and exhibit heat affected zone (HAZ). Compared to other repairing processes, LENS cannot only reduce the manufacturing time and cost, increase material utilization, but also provide an outstanding as-fabricated mechanical properties. Considering the compatibility and availability of powder materials, the selection of to-be-fabricated materials are important and decisive to the mechanical properties and the quality of the deposits. In this investigation, nickel-based and cobalt based superalloys are deposited onto AISI 4140 steel substrate using laser engineered net shaping (LENS) process to verify the feasibility of these superalloys for repairing of AISI 4140 workpieces. The micro-hardness, tensile strength, fracture and wear resistance are analyzed to testify the resistance of deformation, tension and anti-friction performance of deposited materials.

SO ARCHIVES OF CIVIL AND MECHANICAL ENGINEERING
AB Palladium layer (7 mu m thick) was deposited on the surface of the Inconel 713 LC, Inconel 625 and CMSX 4 Ni-base superalloys by the electroplating method. Electroplated samples were annealed at 1050 degrees C for 2 h in the argon atmosphere. The aluminide coatings were deposited by the CVD method. The nonmodified aluminide coating consists of the NiAl phase. Palladium modification let to formation of the (Ni, Pd) Al phase in coatings. The palladium modified as well as nonmodified coatings were oxidized at 1100 degrees C in the air atmosphere. For both Inconel 713 LC and CMSX 4 superalloys palladium modified coatings show better oxidation resistance than nonmodified ones. Palladium inhibits the outward diffusion of substrate elements (cobalt and chromium) during oxidation of the aluminide coating. Moreover, it stabilizes the beta-NiAl phase, keeps the higher content of aluminum in the beta-NiAl phase for a long time and thus increases the lifetime of the coated substrate.

TI Electrochemical Dissolution Behavior of the Nickel-Based Cast Superalloy
   K423A in NaNO3 Solution
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB To date, many types of nickel-based superalloys have been widely used as key components in aircraft engines, and these can be categorized into wrought nickel-based superalloys and cast nickel-based superalloys according to the manufacturing process. However, regardless of the nature of the manufacturing process, nickel-based superalloys are difficult to machine using traditional methods Electrochemical machining (ECM) is an effective method for machining difficult-to-cut materials, especially nickel-based alloys, and there have been many reports concerning the electrochemical dissolution behavior of such alloys. However, the electrochemical dissolution behavior of cast superalloys has seldom been discussed.
   This study focuses on the electrochemical dissolution behavior of the cast superalloy K423A. The microstructure of the specimen was examined and numerous carbides were found to be distributed irregularly throughout the matrix, especially at the grain boundaries. The effects of the electrolyte and the electrolysis parameters on the electrochemical dissolution behavior were investigated by assessing the polarization curves and the open-circuit potentials. The results showed that a relatively stable and efficient dissolution process could be obtained using 10% NaNO3 solution at 40 degrees C. Dissolution experiments were performed at various current densities and corrosion times. A highly efficient and erratic current efficiency curve was found. The corroded specimens were examined using a surface-finish measuring instrument, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). The results showed that the microstructure of K423A, especially in terms of carbon and carbides, seriously interfered with the stability of the electrochemical dissolution process and led to a poor surface quality. A qualitative model has been proposed to illustrate the electrochemical dissolution behavior of K423A in NaNO3 solution. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The purpose was to compare machinability of this refractory material in both cases. It was shown that a superior surface finish was obtained in high speed milling (comparable to grinding), but cutting tools were rapidly worn out. To be cost effective, milling FSX414 with high cutting speed is recommended either when surface roughness is the main constraint of workpiece or after optimizing cutting parameters to maximize tool life.

AB The improvement of creep-rupture properties by serrated grain boundaries was investigated using cobalt-base superalloys containing about 14 to 20 wt.% tungsten at 1089 and 1311 K. Serrated grain boundaries improved both the rupture life and the ductility, especially under lower stresses at 1089 K. The increase in rupture life was larger in the alloys containing a larger amount of W. Ductile grain boundary fracture surfaces, which involved dimple patterns and grain boundary ledges, were observed in the specimens with serrated grain boundaries whereas brittle grain boundary facets were observed in the specimens with normal straight grain boundaries ruptured at 1089 K. The strengthening by serrated grain boundaries was also effective at 1311 K, but there was little difference in the rupture life between the specimens with serrated grain boundaries and those with straight grain boundaries under lower stresses, since serrated grain boundaries developed also in the specimens with straight grain boundaries according to grain boundary precipitates forming during creep at 1311 K. The increase in W content of the alloys led to the increase in rupture life of the specimens with serrated grain boundaries at 1089 and 1311 K.

TI Oxidation behaviors of Co-A1-W-0.1B superalloys in a long-term
   isothermal exposure at 900 degrees C
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Co-Al-W-0.1B superalloys have been isothermally oxidized at 900 degrees C for 1000,5000 and 10000 h in order to investigate their oxidation behaviors. The oxide layers and morphologies were characterized by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy combined with energy-dispersive spectroscopy. After 1000 h exposure, a Co3W/gamma zone, an Al2O3 layer, a mixture of Co, Al, W oxides layer and a CoO layer are established on the substrate alloys. After extended oxidation, a discontinuous Al2O3 layer in Co-9Al-8W-0.1 B and Co-9Al-9W-0.1B alloys leads to an additional mixed oxide layer on the substrate instead of the Co3W/gamma zone. The oxide layers that form on the Co-9Al-8W-0.1B and Co-9Al-9W-0.1B alloys are much thicker than those on the Co-9Al-11W-0.1B alloy, and continuously thicken during oxidation. The higher content of W is beneficial to improving the oxidation resistance as it facilitates a faster formation of Co3 W as well as Al2O3.

TI Effect of alumina dispersion on oxidation behavior as well as friction
   and wear behavior of HVOF-sprayed CoCrAlYTaCSi coating at elevated
   temperature up to 1000 degrees C
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB CoCrAlYTaCSi alloy coating and CoCrAlYTaCSi Al2O3. composite coating were prepared on Inconel 718 alloy substrate by high velocity oxy-fuel (HVOF) spraying in order to avoid the failure of the hot parts made of the Ni-based alloy induced by oxidation and wear damage at elevated temperature of up to 1000 degrees C, with which the agglomerated powder of CoCrAlYTaCSi and Al2O3 was sintered to afford the to-be-sprayed CoCrAlYTaCSi-Al2O3 powder. The microstructure and phase composition of the as-sprayed coatings were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction, and their mechanical properties were determined with a Vicker's hardness tester and a nano-indentation tester. Furthermore, the oxidation behavior of the coatings was evaluated by thermogravimetry and oxidation test in muffle furnace, and their friction and wear behavior under dry sliding against Si3N4 ball from room temperature to 1000 degrees C was evaluated with a high temperature tribometer. Results show that Ta, C and Si elements mainly exist in the forms of TaC and SiC nano-particles in as-sprayed coatings. The incorporation of Al2O3 dispersion results in a significant increase in the hardness, modulus, contact stiffness and wear resistance, but metallic Co and Cr slightly reduce the oxidation resistance of CoCrAlYTaCSi coating. Particularly, as-fabricated CoCrAlYTaCSi-Al2O3 coating exhibits much better wear resistance than CoCrAlYTaCSi coating and other MCrAlY/oxide metal-matrix coatings prepared by HVOF or other technologies, showing promising potential as a protective coating of Ni-alloy based hot parts.

TI Effect of minor additions on the formation of TCP phases in modified
   RR2086 SX superalloys
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB The effect of minor additions (C and Hf) on the formation of topologically closed-packed (TCP) phases in single crystal (SX) superalloy RR2086 has been investigated. The base RR2086 and the modified RR2086 were exposed at 950degreesC for 200-2000 h. It was found that both alloys were very stable in terms of TCP phase precipitation. TCP phases initiated in the dendrite regions in both the base and modified RR2086 and near MC carbides in the modified material as well. However, TCP phases formed faster in the modified RR2086 than in the base RR2086. This indicated that the minor additions in the modified RR2086 expedited the formation of TCP phases. EDX measurements showed that Re, W, Cr and Co were predominant in TCP phases, in agreement with the Scheil simulation; that they also segregated in the dendrite cores in both alloys and near MC carbides in the modified RR2086; and that the segregation was intensified by the minor additions in the modified material. These EDX results can explain the initiation of TCP phases in the dendrite cores in both alloys, the formation of TCP phases near MC precipitates, and the faster TCP phase precipitation in the modified RR2086. In contrast with the RR2086, TCP phase formation was retarded by the same minor additions in the modified RR2072. It was thought that this difference was to due to the formation Of M23C6 phase which was influenced by the concentration of chromium. The higher level of chromium in RR2072 promoted M23C6 phase prior to the precipitation of TCP phases in the modified RR2072 and subsequently retarded the occurrence of sigma phase to a later stage than in the base RR2072. The lower level of chromium in RR2086 suppressed M23C6 precipitation in the modified alloy, and as a result TCP phase precipitation was only influenced by the microsegregation, which led to the faster formation of TCP phases in the modified RR2086 than in the base material.

TI Utilization of hot deformation to trigger strain induced boundary
   migration (SIBM) in Ni-base superalloys
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB The effect of strain on the resultant microstructure of an experimental low stacking fault energy Nickel based superalloy containing 24 wt. pct. Co was investigated. Billets subjected to a preliminary heat treatment at 1110 degrees C were compressed to strain limits of 0.15 and 0.5 at strain rates ranging from 0.1/s to 0.01/s and temperatures at 1020 degrees C and 1060 degrees C. The as-deformed microstructures were assessed and characterized using electron backscatter diffraction, as were microstructures corresponding to a super-solvus anneal heat treatment at 1160 degrees C for one hour. This study sought to identify a critical strain limit at which conditions indicative of Strain induced boundary migration (SIBM) could be effectively triggered for the experimental Ni-based super alloy over a set range of thermal-mechanical parameters. Microstructures corresponding to SIBM were then compared to more extensively deformed billets which contained notable fractions of dynamically recrystallized grains to quantify differences in the length fraction and density of Sigma 3 twin boundaries of the respective microstructures. Though billet samples deformed to both 0.15 and 0.5 contained notable magnitudes of stored strain energy, microstructures deformed to 0.15 were noted as having maintained larger length fractions of Sigma 3 twins due to a predominant absence of dynamic recrystallization. Annealed samples originally deformed to 0.15 yielded annealing twin length fractions as high as 59% when compared a sample deformed to the 0.5 strain limit under equivalent thermal-mechanical conditions that resulted in a twin length fraction of 50%. Although samples deformed to the lower strain limit exhibited higher length fractions of annealing twins, samples deformed to the higher strain limit of 0.5 were noted to yield Sigma 3 densities as high as 0.65 mu m(-1), whereas the annealed sample deformed under equivalent thermal-mechanical parameters to the 0.15 strain limit produced Sigma 3 densities as low as 0.32 mu m(-1).

TI CREEP MECHANISM OF A Ni-Co BASE WROUGHT SUPERALLOY
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB Ni-based wrought superalloys are widely used in the hot section of aircraft gas turbine engines for their capability in retaining strength and resisting creep, fatigue, and oxidation at elevated temperature. With the development of the newer generation turbine disk alloys, it is highly imperative for aircraft engine manufacturers to substantiate the use of the materials by conducting a thorough examination of their mechanical properties. As these components are subjected to elevated temperatures and complex stress state in the service process where time dependent creep is the primary deformation failure mechanism and life-limiting factor for the component, it is of great importance to evaluate the relationship between microstructure, creep behavior and the underlying creep deformation mechanism. Therefore, the main objective of the present research aims at investigating the fundamental relationship between external creep condition and internal creep deformation mechanism in a new wrought superalloy with low stacking fault energy (SFE). In order to study the influences of the loading stress level and temperature on the creep deformation mechanism, stress range of 345-840 MPa and temperature range of 650-815 degrees C were selected to carry out the creep experiment. The results show that two kinds of gamma' with different diameters distributed in the matrix and the larger one began to coarsen when the creep temperature increased to 725 degrees C. Under creep temperature of 650 degrees C, the formation of SF resulted from the shearing of gamma' by dislocations dominated the creep deformation. When the temperature range was raised up to 725-760 degrees C, SF and microtwins were the main microstructures after creep deformation. With further increasing the temperature and load, instead of accommodating only in the gamma', the SF and microtwins penetrated the whole gamma' and matrix area. When the temperature was increased to 815 degrees C, the climb/bypass mechanism controlled the creep process.

TI Hot corrosion behaviour of a cobalt-base super-alloy K40S with and
   without NiCrAlYSi coating
SO CORROSION SCIENCE
AB A NiCrAlYSi coating was deposited by arc ion plating on a cobalt-base super-alloy K40S to improve its hot corrosion resistance at 1173 K in air. The K40S suffered from accelerated corrosion and formed non-protective scale with poor adherence when its surface was beneath Na(2)SO(4) and Na(2)SO(4) containing 25 wt.% NaCl salt deposits. After the K40S was coated with NiCrAlYSi coating, a protective alpha-Al(2)O(3) scale was formed on the coating. Although the NiCrAlYSi coating changed into NiCoCrAlYSi during corrosion processes, it still possessed good corrosion resistance. In addition, the corrosion mechanisms were discussed on a basis of basic fluxing model. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   superalloys
SO INTERMETALLICS
AB The structure and chemistry of Ni-Co-Al-Ti quaternary superalloys are investigated at the micro structural and atomic scale. Atom probe tomograghy (APT) is used to quantify phase compositions and elemental partitioning behavior. Using aberration corrected electron microscopy, the site occupancy of the atoms within the A(3) B structure (L1(2)-type) gamma' phase is determined via atomic resolution energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). Ni is observed to preferentially occupy the A sub-lattice positions for all alloys, while Al and Ti occupy the B sub-lattice. In contrast, Co's site preference changes from a random distribution to the A sub-lattice as the alloy composition changes, in agreement with theoretical predictions from literature. Finally, the lattice strain across the 771, interfaces is measured as a function of alloy composition. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Water Vapour Effect on the Oxidation Mechanism of a Cobalt-Based Alloy
   at High Temperatures (800-1,100 A degrees C)
SO OXIDATION OF METALS
AB A cobalt-based Phynox alloy was oxidized in the 800-1,100 A degrees C temperature range. The alloy oxidation was consistent with a growth mechanism limited by the diffusion process in a growing Cr2O3 oxide scale. Water vapour enhanced the alloy oxidation rate and scale porosity. Thermal cycling tests at 900 and 1,000 A degrees C showed that water vapour reduces the outer Mn1.5Cr1.5O4 subscale adherence, but the chromia scale adherence was not affected. These temperatures permited a rapid chromium supply from the substrate to form a continuous chromia scale. At 1,100 A degrees C thermal cycling conditions led to scale spallation and chromium depletion in the alloy. In dry air, weight losses were recorded due to cobalt and molybdenum oxidation, giving CoCr2O4 and CoMoO4. In wet air, the initial porous chromia scale permited nickel and cobalt oxidation, leading to Ni5Co3O8 and CoCr2O4 formation and resulting in bad adherence during thermal cycling.

SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY
AB Mar-M 247, a nickel-base cast alloy, is used widely in aeroengines for parts such as blades, vanes and airfoil. Hastelloy X is one of the most oxidation-and corrosion-resistant nickel-base wrought alloys. In order to join such alloys in aeroengine manufacturing, laser beam welding has been carried out with lap and butt joints using a 1.2 and a 6.0 kW CO2 laser. Cracks in the fusion zone can be eliminated by deliberate misalignments in the ranging of the laser beam by 0.2-0.3 mm onto Hastelloy X. Correlations between cracking behavior, hardness of the beads and misalignments have been investigated. Metallurgical analysis using electron microscopes has revealed the redistribution of alloy elements, the microstructures of the fusion zone and microfissures in the heat-affected zone (HAZ).

AB Refurbishments of superalloys which are used in manufacturing gas turbine hot components usually consists of removing cracks and other defects by blending and then repair welding in order to reconstruct damaged area. In this study, the effects of welding parameters on repair of FSX-414 superalloy, as the most applicable cobalt base superalloy in order to manufacture gas turbine nozzles, by use of Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW) technic were investigated. Results then were compared by Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW). Metallographic and SEM studies of the microstructure of the weld and HAZ showed that there are no noticeable defects in the microstructure by use of GMAW. Also, chemical analysis and morphologies of carbide in both methods are similar. Hardness profile of the GMAW structure then also compared with GTAW and no noticeable difference was observed between the profiles. Also, proper tensile properties, compared with GTAW, can be achieved by use of optimum parameters that can be obtained by examining the current and welding speed. Tensile properties of optimized condition of the GMAW then were compared with GTAW. It was seen that the room and high temperature tensile properties of the GMAW structure is very similar and results confirmed that changing the technic did not have any significant influence on the properties.

TI The investigation of carbides evolution in a cobalt-base superalloy at
   elevated temperature
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB The carbides evolution characteristics and mechanisms in a cobalt-base superalloy at elevated temperatures between 1140 and 1265 degrees C have been investigated to provide the basis for potential service and heat treatment of the alloy. The in-situ transformation of M7C3 -> M23C6 is observed directly, which has not been reported in previous studies of cobalt-base superalloys. M23C6 carbide nucleates at the M7C3/ matrix interface due to the coherent relationship between M23C6 carbide and the matrix, and grows towards M7C3 carbide. On the other hand, it is found that primary MC carbide degenerates and releases a large number of Ti and W. Thus, residual MC carbide exhibits increased concentration ratios for Ta and Zr and shows enhanced thermal stability. The results indicate that the degeneration behavior of MC carbide is temperature dependent: MC decomposes into M6C carbide at lower temperature and dissolves partially into the matrix at higher temperature.

SO CHINA FOUNDRY
AB The control of grain size in superalloys is critical in the manufacture of gas turbine blades. The aim of the present research is to provide the technology for producing complicated hollow turbine blades with fine surface grains and better comprehensive mechanical properties. By melt superheating treatment and coating the internal surfaces of shell mould using a cobalt aluminate-bearing coating material, the influence of cobalt aluminate as inoculant on the surface grain sizes of turbine blade was studied with addition of cobalt aluminate: 0, 35%, 45% - 65% and 100% respectively. At the same time, the effects of cooling circumstances of the blades on surface grain sizes were also experimented under the same addition of cobalt aluminate. The results showed that the melt superheating treatment plays a significant role in the grain size and carbide morphology; and fine surface grains were obtained when the internal surfaces of shell mould were coated using cobalt aluminate coatings. When the addition of cobalt aluminate in coating is between 45% - 65%, and the melt is poured into preheated shell moulds with fine silica sand as backing sand, the blades satisfied the surface grain size requirement is over 90%. In addition, comparisons of the surface grain size and the mechanical properties were also conducted between home-made and foreign-made blades.

AB MCrAlY type (M = Ni and/or Co) coatings are widely used for the protection of components in the hot sections of gas turbines at high service temperatures by forming a continuous alpha-alumina. A reliable criterion to estimate the capability of coating to form alpha-alumina is of great importance to accurately evaluate coating lifetime. However, some coatings retain the ability to form a continuous alpha-alumina scale when the concentration of Al in coatings decreases to a critical level, therefore, the empirical Al-concentration based criterion is inadequate to properly predict the formation of a continuous alpha-alumina. Thus, a new life criterion, namely the critical Al-activity criterion, is proposed.
   In this work, the critical Al-activity to form a continuous a-alumina was validated by Al-activity calculation using Thermo-Calc software based on survey of research results of critical Al-concentration to form alpha-alumina on binary Ni-Al and ternary Ni-Cr-Al systems. Long-term oxidation tests were performed to support the criterion: three different MCrAlY coatings coated on IN-792 superalloy substrates were oxidized at 1000 degrees C for various periods of time up to 10,000 h. The microstructural evolution of MCrAlY coatings was investigated using Scanning Electron Microscope. The near-surface Al concentration and interdiffusion behaviour between substrate and coating were measured using Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy. The new critical Al-activity criterion has been successfully adopted in alpha-alumina formation prediction, showing a good agreement with experiment results. Therefore, it can be concluded that the extrapolation of new criterion from binary and ternary systems to multi-alloyed MCrAlY system is reasonable. Furthermore, the partial pressure of oxygen (P-O2) in atmosphere has been taken into consideration by combination with Al-activity to calculate the critical chemical reaction constant (K) of formation of a-alumina. The potential applicability of the methodology to predict MCrAlY life is also discussed.

TI FUNDAMENTAL-ASPECTS OF HIGH-TEMPERATURE CORROSION
SO JOURNAL DE PHYSIQUE IV
AB Some recent considerations in three widely different aspects of high-temperature corrosion are summarized: 1) reactions at the metal/scale interface in support of scale growth; 2) mass transfer effects in the control of evaporation of volatile reaction products; and 3) the co-deposition of multiple elements for diffusion coatings using halide-activated cementation packs. The climb of misfit edge dislocations from the metal/scale interface can achieve the annihilation of vacancies associated with scales grown by cation diffusion. For scale growth at the metal/scale interface by anion diffusion, the creation of anion vacancies occurs by the climb of misorientation dislocations. For cation-diffusing scales, a blocking of the vacancy annihilation reaction may be achieved by the specific adsorption of reactive elements at the metal/scale interface. The pinning of the interfacial misfit dislocations by segregated reactive elements can explain the changes in growth mechanism, in growth stresses, and in reaction kinetics associated with the reactive element effect for the growth of chromia scales on alloys. Although the vapor pressures of volatile species are readily calculated from available thermodynamic data, the use of these values to predict the kinetics of transport-limited evaporation has not been presented specifically for various substrate geometries and differing flow conditions. The empirical mass transfer relations are evaluated and plotted for the flat plat and tube geometries in the laminar and turbulent flow regimes. A criterion for the stability of a flat interface in selective evaporation from an alloy is still lacking. Despite the inherent difficulty to codeposit two or more elements with greatly differing thermodynamic stabilities for their halide species, cementation coating packs can be designed with selected combinations of powdered masteralloys and halide activator salts whereby elements are codeposited to yield a desirable surface composition. Selected examples for effective aluminizing/chromizing of Ni-base superalloys and for chromizing/siliconizing of steels are presented.

Although advantageous in terms of its energy density, the melting point of this salt (1121 K) is beyond the commonly accepted upper-use temperature of 1100 K for chromium-bearing superalloys in vacuum. However, one commercially available nickel-base superalloy (Hastelloy B-2) is chromium free; unfortunately, because of its high molybdenum content, this alloy can form phases that cause high-temperature embrittlement. To test the suitability of Hastelloy B-2, it has been exposed to molten LiF, its vapor and vacuum at 1173 K for 2500, 5000, and 10(4) h. For control, the chromium-containing cobalt-base Haynes alloy 188 and nickel-base Haynes alloy 230 were also exposed to LiF and vacuum at 1173 K for 5000 h. Neither LiF nor vacuum exposures had any significant effect on Hastelloy B-2 in terms of microstructural surface damage or weight change. Measurement of the post exposure tensile properties of Hastelloy B-2, nevertheless, revealed low tensile ductility at 1050 K. Such embrittlement and low strength at elevated temperatures appear to preclude the use of Hastelloy B-2 as a containment material for LiF. Little evidence of significant attack by LiF was seen in either of the chromium-containing superalloys; however, considerable weight loss and near-surface microstructural damage occurred in both alloys exposed to vacuum. Although measurement of the post exposure room-temperature tensile properties of Haynes alloys 188 and 230 revealed no significant loss of strength or ductility, the severe degree of microstructural damage found in unshielded alloys exposed to vacuum indicates that chromium-bearing superalloys might also be unsuitable for prolonged containment of LiF in space above 1100 K.

TI Room and high temperature wear behaviors of nickel and cobalt base weld
   overlay coatings on hot forging dies
SO WEAR
AB The lifetime of dies used for production of forged parts is variable and determined by wear rate, plastic deformation, thermal and mechanical fatigue. These tools are subjected to extreme temperature at high unit pressures for short durations and must withstand multiple cycles while maintaining dimensional stability. This paper is an investigation into the use of nickel and cobalt base superalloys as wear resistant hardfacing materials on H11 tool steel. Three weld overlay alloys including Inconel 625, Stellite 6 and Stellite 21 were deposited on H11 steel substrates using tungsten inert gas welding (TIG) process. Wear tests were carried out using a pin-on-disk wear tester at room temperature and 550 degrees C. Microhardness of the weld overlays was obtained and the worn surfaces were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results of the laboratory tests were then compared with the results obtained from field studies. The results showed a much lower wear at high temperature with the weld overlays due to formation of smooth compacted oxide layers on the wear surfaces. Inconel 625 showed the best wear behavior among the weld overlays at high temperature. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Controlling mechanical properties of additively manufactured hastelloy X
   by altering solidification pattern during laser powder-bed fusion
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB Like other manufacturing processes, controlling the microstructure of additively manufactured parts is essential to reach the desirable mechanical properties. However, available reports on the control of as-build microstructure and mechanical properties of Ni-base superalloys during laser powder-bed fusion (LPBF) process are not comprehensive. This article aims at a systematic approach to study the effect of scanning strategies and build orientations on solidification patterns in the printed LPBF Hastelloy X parts. The as-built microstructure (grain size, texture) and mechanical responses (yield strength, ultimate tensile strength (UTS), and elongation) are also presented. Results reveal that the stripe unidirectional scan pattern leads to the largest grain size ( > 850 mu m) with the lowest mechanical strength. These samples also exhibit the strongest crystallographic texture, resulting in a planar anisotropic mechanical response (similar to 22 MPa difference in UTS). On the other hand, the stripe rotation scan strategy (67 rotation) leads to a randomly oriented and finer grain structure (similar to 110 mu m) with a higher UTS (similar to 800 MPa) due to grain refinement observed in these samples. In addition, the aspect ratio of the columnar grain structure was observed to influence the mechanical response of these parts. UTS of horizontally printed parts were 26% more than the vertical parts for the stripe scan strategy (67 degrees rotation). However, changing the solidification pattern (stripe XY with 90 degrees rotation) was observed to reduce this difference to similar to 18%. These findings can be used to tune the microstructure of as-built LPBF parts to obtain an optimal mechanical behaviour.

   CASTINGS
SO ARCHIVES OF METALLURGY AND MATERIALS
AB The effect of cobalt aluminate inoculant addition and melt-pouring temperature on the structure and mechanical properties of Ni-based superalloy was studied. The first major move to control the quality of investment cast blades and vanes was the control of grain size. Cobalt aluminate (CoAl2O4) is the most frequently utilized inoculant in the lost-wax casting process of Ni-based superalloys. The inoculant in the prime coat of moulds and pouring temperature play a significant role in grain size control. The fmest surface grains were obtained when the internal surface of shell mould was coated with cobalt aluminate and subsequently pouring was at 1480 degrees C. The influence of selected casting parameters and inoculant addition on mechanical properties was investigated on the basis of tensile, creep and hardness testing. The effect of grain refinement on mechanical properties were consistent with established theories. Tests conducted at ambient temperature indicated a beneficial effect of grain refinement both on tensile strength and hardness. In contrast at elevated temperature during creep, the reverse trend was observed.

AB The phase constituents of alloys from the (Ni,Co)(85)(Al,Ti)(15) plane of the Ni-Co-Al-Ti quaternary system were investigated following prolonged exposure at 750 degrees C. Microstructural investigations confirmed the existence of a continuous A1-L1(2)) two-phase region in the Ni-Co-Al-Ti quaternary system between Ni-Ni3Al and Co-Co3Ti. The lattice misfits of alloys from this quaternary system were determined using neutron diffraction. With increasing contents of Ti the positive lattice misfit increases up to +0.79% in the Ti-containing alloys, which leads to an increasing tetragonal distortion of the gamma matrix phase due to the increasing coherency stresses.

SO SCRIPTA MATERIALIA
AB The segregation of solutes at dislocations in a polycrystalline and a single crystal nickel-based superalloy is studied. Our observations confirm the often assumed but yet unproven diffusion along dislocations via pipe diffusion. Direct observation and quantitative, near-atomic scale segregation of chromium and cobalt at dislocations within gamma' precipitates and at interfacial dislocations leading to the partial or complete dissolution of gamma' precipitates at elevated temperatures is presented. Our results allow us to elucidate the physical mechanism by which pipe diffusion initiates the undesirable dissolution of gamma' precipitates. (C) 2017 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Samples of commercially pure nickel and two common superalloys were prepared by electroplating a thin layer of platinum on the surface, then exposing the samples to temperatures of 950 degreesC and 1080 degreesC for periods of two and six hours. Using electron probe micro analysis (EMPA), elemental composition profiles were obtained from the samples following the diffusion steps. The relative diffusion coefficients for a number of elements were determined using a classical Boltzmann-Matano method. As expected, it was discovered that elements such as cobalt, chromium, titanium and tantalum displayed a significant diffusional response in this relatively short time, while tungsten, molybdenum and rhenium diffused to a lesser degree under these conditions. It was discovered that there is significant interaction between many of the alloying elements in these systems during the diffusion anneal. The limitations of the analytical technique are summarized.

TI Residual Stresses in Inertia-Friction-Welded Dissimilar High-Strength
   Steels
SO METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND
   MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB The welding of dissimilar alloys is seen increasingly as a way forward to improve efficiencies in modern aeroengines, because it allows one to tailor varying material property demands across a component. Dissimilar inertia friction welding (IFW) of two high-strength steels, Aermet 100 and S/CMV, has been identified as a possible joint for rotating gas turbine components and the resulting welds are investigated in this article. In order to understand the impact of the welding process and predict the life expectancy of such structures, a detailed understanding of the residual stress fields present in the welded component is needed. By combining energy-dispersive synchrotron X-ray diffraction (EDSXRD) and neutron diffraction, it has been possible to map the variations in lattice spacing of the ferritic phase on both sides of two tubular Aermet 100-S/CMV inertia friction welds (as-welded and postweld heat-treated condition) with a wall thickness of 37 mm. Laboratory-based XRD measurements were required to take into account the variation in the strain-free d-spacing across the weld region. It was found that, in the heat-affected zone (HAZ) slightly away from the weld line, residual stress fields showed tensile stresses increasing most dramatically in the hoop direction toward the weld line. Closer to the weld line, in the plastically affected zone, a sharp drop in the residual stresses was observed on both sides, although more dramatically in the S/CMV. In addition to residual stress mapping, synchrotron XRD measurements were carried out to map microstructural changes in thin slices cut from the welds. By studying the diffraction peak asymmetry of the 200-alpha diffraction peak, it was possible to demonstrate that a martensitic phase transformation in the S/CMV is responsible for the significant stress reduction close to the weld line. The postweld heat treatment (PWHT) chosen to avoid any overaging of the Aermet 100 and to temper the S/CMV martensite resulted in little stress relief on the S/CMV side of the weld.
