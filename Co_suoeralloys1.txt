TI Cobalt-base high-temperature alloys
SO SCIENCE
AB We have identified cobalt-base superalloys showing a high-temperature strength greater than those of conventional nickel-base superalloys. The cobalt-base alloys are strengthened by a ternary compound with the L1(2) structure, gamma ' Co-3( Al,W), which precipitates in the disordered gamma face-centered cubic cobalt matrix with high coherency and with high melting points. We also identified a ternary compound, gamma ' Ir-3(Al, W), with the L1(2) structure, which suggests that the Co-Ir-Al-W-base systems with gamma + gamma ' (Co, Ir)(3)(Al, W) structures offer great promise as candidates for next-generation high-temperature materials.

SO OCHRONA PRZED KOROZJA
AB This paper presents the oxidation behavior of tungsten-free gamma-gamma' Co-10Al- 5Mo-2Nb and Co-20Ni-10Al-5Mo-2Nb cobalt-based superalloys. This type of alloys is an alternative materials for tungsten contains alloys of Co-Al-W type with gamma'-Co-3(Al.W) intermetallic phase adequate to gamma'-Ni3Al phase identified in Ni based superalloys. Applications of Mo and Nb as a replacement of W is related to tendency to lowering the density of alloys. The investigation included thermogravimetric studies up to 1200 degrees C. The oxidized layer was evaluated, therein microstructure, chemical and phase composition analyses were performed using various methods, inclusive of x-ray diffraction, SEM/EDS analysis and light microscopy.

   Cobalt-Based Superalloys After Oxidation at 800 degrees C
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING AND PERFORMANCE
AB A new type gamma-gamma' Co-Al-Mo-Nb Co-based superalloys were developed due to limitations of basic Co-Al-W superalloys, related to tungsten alloying. The present study aims to characterization of new gamma-gamma' Co-10Al-5Mo-2Nb (at.%) cobalt-based superalloy performance in terms of the high-temperature exposure under cyclic conditions, with particular regard to surface condition. Specimens were tested in cycles of high-temperature exposition (25, 50, 75, 100 and 150 h) in air environment at 800 A degrees C. Detailed analysis of oxidized surfaces by scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction was made at various intervals during testing. The cyclic oxidation behavior of new alloy was compared to the basic Co-9Al-9W (at.%) Co-based superalloy.

SO SCRIPTA MATERIALIA
AB New polycrystalline Co-base superalloys with gamma/gamma' microstructure have been developed, which show excellent mechanical properties and enhanced oxidation behavior. The gamma' solvus temperature of these alloys is comparatively low giving a large processing window. The yield strength of these alloys is similar to that of wrought Ni-base superalloys. However, the creep strength at 750 degrees C is largely exceeding that of the Ni-base superalloys Waspaloy and Udimet 720Li.

TI Thermogravimetric Investigations of Novel gamma-gamma ' Co-Al-W and
   Co-Al-Mo-Nb Cobalt-Based Superalloys
SO JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING MATERIALS AND TECHNOLOGY-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME
AB Cobalt-based gamma-gamma' superalloys are novel heat-resistant materials suitable for high-temperature applications, such as components of the turbine engine. These alloys exhibit favorable strength and corrosion resistance at high temperatures owing to the gamma-gamma' microstructure, analogous to that of Ni-based superalloys. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the oxidation behavior of basic Co-9Al-9W (at%) and new tungsten-free Co-10Al-5Mo-2Nb (at%) alloys at elevated temperatures. The investigation is concerned with thermogravimetric studies in the temperature range of 40-1200 degrees C. The oxidized surfaces after high temperature oxidation have been characterized using optical microscopy (OM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD).

TI A new tungsten-free gamma-gamma ' Co-Al-Mo-Nb-based superalloy
SO SCRIPTA MATERIALIA
AB We present the first report of a tungsten-free cobalt-based superalloy having a composition Co-10Al-5Mo-2Nb. The alloy is strengthened by cuboidal precipitates of metastable Co-3(Al,Mo,Nb) distributed throughout the microstructure. The precipitates are coherent with the face-centred cubic gamma-Co matrix and possess ordered Ll(2) structure. The microstructure is identical to the popular gamma-gamma' type nickel-based superalloys and that of recently reported Co-Al-W-based alloys. Being tungsten free, the reported alloy has higher specific proof stress compared to existing cobalt-based superalloys. (C) 2014 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Regulating the coarsening of the gamma ' phase in superalloys
SO NPG ASIA MATERIALS
AB The properties of superalloys are typically deteriorated by the coarsening of the nano-sized gamma' phase, which is the primary strengthening component at high temperatures. Stabilizing the gamma' phase represents one of the key challenges in developing next-generation superalloys. Herein, we fabricate a cobalt-nickel-based superalloy with a nanoscale coherent gamma' phase, (Ni,Co)(3) (Al, Ti, Nb), which is isolated by stacking-fault ribbons in the alloy matrix as a result of the Suzuki segregation of alloying atoms. Additionally, we demonstrate that this new nanostructure can slow down the coarsening of the gamma' phase at high temperatures. As a result, the cobalt-nickel-based superalloy displays considerably high tensile yield points, exceeding 1650 MPa at room temperature and 1250 MPa at 973 K, which are markedly higher than those of the commonly used nickel-and cobalt-based superalloys. This study thereby paves a new path for developing superalloys with exceptional mechanical performance and thermal stability.

The tensile creep behavior of these new Ni-Co-base superalloys at temperatures in the range of 650-760 degrees C and at initial applied stresses of 480-830 MPa were investigated. Comparing a new Ni-Co-base alloy (TMW-4) to U720Li by a Larson-Miller plot shows that a temperature gain in stress-rupture strength of 30 can be expected in a TMW alloy with fine-grained microstructure (10 (m).

TI Effect of Cr on the Oxidation Resistance of Co-Based Oxide Dispersion
   Strengthened Superalloys
SO MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS
AB Alumina-forming oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) superalloys are favorable oxidation-resistant materials for extremely high temperature applications. In order to develop the advanced Co-based superalloys with high strength and superior oxidation resistance at elevated temperature of 1000 degrees C, a new series of Co-Cr-Al ODS superalloys were designed and fabricated by mechanical alloying (MA) and spark plasma sintering (SPS), and then followed by hot rolling and annealing at 1200 degrees C. In this work, the oxidation behavior of Co-10Al (mass%) ODS superalloys with/without 20Cr was investigated at 1000 degrees C in air to understand the effect of Cr on oxidation resistance. The results indicate that the addition of Cr improves the oxidation resistance significantly through optimizing the oxide scales from the multilevel scales with an external CoO/CoAl2O4 and an internal Al2O3 to a single layer of Al2O3. The alumina-forming Co-20Cr-10Al (mass%) ODS superalloys are expected to be applicable at 1000 degrees C.

TI Beyond Ni-based superalloys: Development of CoRe-based alloys for gas
   turbine applications at very high temperatures
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MATERIALS RESEARCH
AB High temperature material development is mainly driven by gas turbine needs. Today, Ni-based superalloys are the dominant material class in the hot section of turbines. Material development will continue to push the maximum service temperature of Ni-superalloys upwards. However, this approach has a fundamental limit and cannot be sustained indefinitely, as the Ni-superalloys are already used very close to their melting point. Within the framework of a DFG Forschergruppe program (FOR 727) - "Beyond Ni-base Superalloys" - CoRe based alloys are being developed at the Technische Universitat Braunschweig as a new generation of high temperature materials that can be used at + 100 degrees C above single crystal Ni-superalloys. Two main strengthening concepts, namely precipitation hardening by MC carbides and composite hardening by Co(2)Re(3)-type phase are being explored in CoRe alloy development. Selected results of microstructural characterizations, including in-situ measurements by synchrotron and neutron scattering are presented.

SO JOURNAL OF THERMAL ANALYSIS AND CALORIMETRY
AB The aim of the study is characterization of high-temperature oxidation behavior of new Co-based superalloys by thermogravimetry (TG). The following alloys have been taken into account: Co-9Al-9W, Co-20-Ni-7Al-7W, Co-10Al-5Mo-2Nb and Co-20Ni-10Al-5Mo-2Nb (at.%). The thermogravimetric analysis was carried out in the temperature range 40-1200 degrees C of heating rate 5 degrees min(-1). The investigation was performed using the thermal analyzer NETZSCH STA 449 F3 Jupiter. TG-DTG plots showed oxidation behavior up to 1200 degrees C and indicated the temperatures of further isothermal oxidation examinations. The oxidation behavior of basic Co-9Al-9W (at.%) alloy was compared to W-free Co-10Al-5Mo-2Nb and Co-20Ni-10Al-5Mo-2Nb (at.%) alloys. The obtained data showed different oxidation behavior dependably on the type of alloying elements. Moreover, the effect of Ni addition on oxidation performance was determined. The scales grown on Co-base superalloys after thermogravimetry were evaluated by means of scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy.

Elemental partition coefficients (K-X = C-gamma/C gamma) of Nb and W in Co-V-Ti-based superalloys are 2.07 and 1.10, respectively. The gamma' solvus temperatures are determined as 1023 degrees C, 1055 degrees C and 1035 degrees C in Co-12V-4Ti, Co-10V-4Ti-2Nb and Co-10V-4Ti-2W alloys, which are higher than those of Co-9Al-9W alloy (1000 degrees C). The mass densities of quaternary Co-10V-4Ti-2Nb and Co-10V-4Ti-2W alloys are about 8.31 and 8.50 g.cm(-3), respectively, which are 15% lower than Co-Al-W-based superalloys (9.8 g.cm(-3)). All examined alloys exhibit an anomalous positive dependence on temperature rising from 600 to 750 degrees C. Strengths of all examined alloys are higher than those of MarM509 (traditional Cobalt-based superalloy) and Co-9Al-9W at all temperatures that we investigated. The maximum flow stress of Co-V-Ti-Nb alloy is about 638 MPa at 750 degrees C while that of Co-V-Ti-W alloy is about 588 MPa at 700 degrees C.

Isothermal oxidation tests conducted at 900, 1000, and 1150 A degrees C indicated that silicon addition can improve oxidation resistance. Furthermore, the alloy content of tungsten can have profound impact on the oxidation behaviour; low content of tungsten can promote the formation of protective alumina at temperatures at and above 1000 A degrees C, while high tungsten content can slow down oxidation at 900 A degrees C.

TI Effect of cobalt on microstructural parameters and mechanical properties

SO JOURNAL OF THE JAPAN INSTITUTE OF METALS
AB The alloying effect of Cobalt (Co) to microstructural parameters and mechanical properties, such as partitioning ratios of alloying elements and creep strength, of Re-bearing Ni-base single crystal superalloys have been investigated. The second generation single crystal superalloys, TMS-82 +, Ni-7.8Co-4.9Cr-1.9Mo-8.7W-5.3AI-6.0Ta-2.4Re-0.1Hf, in mass% (8Co) was compared to a Co-free (0Co) and 15 mass% Co (15Co) alloy which had the same chemical composition as TMS-82 + except that Co was changed.
   It was shown that the partitioning ratios of alloying elements tend to k(= X-y/K-y') = 1, as the content of Co was increased.
   Furthermore, it was found that there was suitable content of Co for the creep strength under various temperature-stress conditions.

TI Intermediate Co/Ni-base model superalloys - Thermophysical properties,
   creep and oxidation
SO SCRIPTA MATERIALIA
AB The mechanical properties of gamma'-strengthened Co-Ni-Al-W-Cr model superalloys extending from pure Ni-base to pure Co-base superalloys have been assessed. Differential scanning calorimetry measurements and thermodynamic calculations match well and show that the gamma' solvus temperature decreases with increasing Co-content The gamma/gamma' lattice misfit is negative on the Ni- and positive on the Co-rich side. High Ni-contents decelerate the oxidation kinetics up to a factor of 15. The creep strength of the Ni-base alloy increases by an order of magnitude with additions of Co before it deteriorates strongly upon higher additions despite an increasing gamma' volume fraction.

TI Synthesis of simple and platinum-modified aluminide coatings on cobalt
   (Co)-base superalloys via a vapor phase aluminizing process
SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB An investigation was conducted to synthesize simple beta-CoAl or beta-(Co,Ni)Al coatings and platinum (Pt)-modified aluminide coatings on cobalt-base superalloys via an industrial vapor phase aluminizing process. Surface morphology and cross-section microstructure of the developed coatings were studied and compared by using optical microscope, scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). Experimental results showed that Al increase in Al-Cr nuggets increases the coating thickness; substrate elements influence the formation of coatings; the increase of the electrodeposited Pt thickness increases the amount of xi PtAl(2) phase after aluminizing process; and the transformation of xi PtAl(2) phase into beta-(Co,Ni,Pt)Al phase can be obtained via a heat treatment process.

TI L1(2)-Strengthened Cobalt-Base Superalloys
SO ANNUAL REVIEW OF MATERIALS RESEARCH, VOL 45
SE Annual Review of Materials Research
AB The discovery of the gamma'-Co-3(Al,W) phase with an L1(2) structure provided Co-base alloys with a new strengthening mechanism, enabling a new class of high-temperature material: Co-base superalloys. This review discusses the current understanding of the phase stability, deformation, and oxidation behaviors of gamma' single-phase and gamma + gamma' two-phase alloys in comparison with Ni-base gamma'-L1(2) phase and gamma + gamma' superalloys. Relatively low stacking fault energies and phase stability of the gamma' phase compared with those in Ni-base alloys are responsible for the unique deformation behaviors observed in Co-base gamma' and gamma + gamma' alloys. Controlling energies of planar defects, such as stacking faults and antiphase boundaries, by alloying is critical for alloy development. Experimental and density functional theory studies indicate that additions of Ta, Ti, Nb, Hf, and Ni are effective in simultaneously increasing the phase stability and stacking fault energy of gamma'-Co-3(Al,W), thus improving the high-temperature strength of Co-base gamma' phase and gamma + gamma' two-phase superalloys.

AB Two cast and heat-treated NbC and TaC - strengthened cobalt superalloys have been developed for an investment casting of spinner discs for glass wool industry. In this work constant load creep tests in tension were carried out in argon atmosphere at three testing temperature 900, 950 and 1000 degrees C and at the initial applied stresses ranging from 40 to 200 MPa. All the tests were continued until the final fracture. The results of creep testing were combined with microstructural and fractographic examinations by means of light and scanning electron microscopy. A mutual comparison of creep characteristics of the investigated superalloys under comparable creep loading conditions showed that NbC-strengthened superalloy exhibited longer creep life than TaC-strengthened one. Further, it was found that carbide precipitation is the primary strengthening mechanism in both cobalt-base superalloys under investigation and the amount, morphology and type of carbides have the decisive effect on the creep properties including creep damage and fracture processes. By contrast, CoNb superalloy exhibited a more brittle character of creep fracture mode than CoTa superalloy due to a premature fracture. This study was initiated to investigate in more details operating creep deformation processes and the effect of the creep microstructure and damage evolution on both investigated superalloys. The different behaviour and properties of studied superalloys were explained based on the received results of this study.

SO CALPHAD-COMPUTER COUPLING OF PHASE DIAGRAMS AND THERMOCHEMISTRY
AB A database for cobalt-base superalloys was built up by combing the binary and ternary thermodynamic descriptions available in the SSOL (SGTE) database and from the literature. Using this database, results of thermodynamic calculations for several cobalt-base superalloys were compared to the experimentally observed n-microstructure of the alloys after homogenization at high temperatures and quenching. Three examples are presented: prediction of phase equilibria versus temperature and composition; selection of highly refractory materials using isothermal sections; and evaluation of local melting temperature in the case of skin formation of Co-base alloy during air oxidation at 1300 degreesC. The agreement between calculated prediction and experimental observation is satisfactory. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Effect of cobalt on micro-structural parameters of Ni-base single
   crystal superalloys
SO JOURNAL OF THE JAPAN INSTITUTE OF METALS
AB Effect of Cobalt on micro-structural parameters, such as the lattice misfit and partitioning behaviors of alloying elements, of Re-bearing Ni-base single crystal superalloys have been investigated. The second-generation single crystal superalloys, TMS-82 + (Ni-7.8Co-4.9Cr-1.9Mo-8.7W-5.3Al-6.0Ta-2.4Re-0.1Hf, in mass%), was compared to a Co-free (0Co) alloy which had the same chemical composition as TMS-82+ except that Co was removed.
   The lattice misfit of 0Co alloy was found to be more negative value than that of TMS-82 + at any temperature. Additionally, when 0Co alloy was equilibrated at 1100 degrees C, Cr, Mo and W partitioned more into the gamma matrix; in contrast, Al and Ti partitioned into the gamma' precipitates. Increase in partitioning of Cr, Mo and W to the gamma phase resulted in an increase in the lattice parameter of gamma phase. Thus, lattice misfit of 0Co tend to more negative value than that of TMS-82 +.

   application to the recycling of Ni-Co-Fe-based end-of-life superalloys
   via remelting
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MINERALS METALLURGY AND MATERIALS
AB To design optimal pyrometallurgical processes for nickel and cobalt recycling, and more particularly for the end-of-life process of Ni-Co-Fe-based end-of-life (EoL) superalloys, knowledge of their activity coefficients in slags is essential. In this study, the activity coefficients of NiO and CoO in CaO-Al2O3-SiO2 slag, a candidate slag used for the EoL superalloy remelting process, were measured using gas/slag/metal equilibrium experiments. These activity coefficients were then used to consider the recycling efficiency of nickel and cobalt by remelting EoL superalloys using CaO-Al2O3-SiO2 slag. The activity coefficients of NiO and CoO in CaO-Al2O3-SiO2 slag both show a positive deviation from Raoult's law, with values that vary from 1 to 5 depending on the change in basicity. The activity coefficients of NiO and CoO peak in the slag with a composition near B = (%CaO)/(%SiO2) = 1, where B is the basicity. We observed that controlling the slag composition at approximately B = 1 effectively reduces the cobalt and nickel oxidation losses and promotes the oxidation removal of iron during the remelting process of EoL superalloys.

The different materials exhibit comparable corrosion resistance with a limited initial passivation followed by severe pitting corrosion at higher potentials. Oxide layers, formed under isothermal oxidation at 800 and 900 degrees C, provide exceptional protection against pitting corrosion. No breakdown events are observed, even for thin layers formed during short-term oxidation (1 h at 900 degrees C).

TI The importance of sign and magnitude of gamma/gamma ' lattice misfit in
   superalloys-with special reference to the new gamma '-hardened
   cobalt-base superalloys
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB In this work, the remarkable high-temperature strength properties of monocrystalline gamma'-hardened Ni-base superalloys are reviewed with the goal of understanding better the important role played by the gamma/gamma' lattice misfit delta with respect to microstructural stability and high-temperature creep and fatigue resistance. In particular, attention is focussed on the phenomenon of microstructural degradation by directional coarsening in the form of gamma/gamma' rafting which also occurs in turbine blades in service. The role played by the lattice misfit (which is negative for all currently used Ni-base superalloys) is elucidated with respect to its sign, magnitude and temperature dependence. Based on a detailed discussion of high-temperature deformation involving gamma/gamma' rafting, it is argued that superalloys with a positive gamma/gamma' lattice misfit should exhibit better high-temperature strength properties than otherwise similar superalloys with a negative misfit. In this context, the new class of gamma'-hardened Co-base superalloys is of special interest. These alloys have promising high-temperature strength properties and possess a positive lattice mismatch. It is suggested that this positive mismatch is one of the beneficial factors that contribute to the promising properties of these alloys and that this aspect should be explored further.

   superalloys with different Ni addition
SO CORROSION SCIENCE
AB High temperature oxidation behaviours of gamma'-strengthened Co-based superalloys with various Ni additions were investigated at both 800 degrees C and 900 degrees C. The results show that the superalloys show excellent oxidation resistance due to the formation of compact spinel oxide scales. With the increasing of Ni addition, the concentration of Cr in scale/alloy interface will be increased but that of Co will be decreased. And the growth of Cr2O3 will be promoted, while CoO nucleation will be hindered. Therefore, increasing Ni addition helps the formation of protective spinel oxide scales and delays nodular oxidation, which favours to be better oxidation resistance.

TI Predicting the morphologies of gamma ' precipitates in cobalt-based
   superalloys
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB Cobalt-based alloys with gamma/gamma ' microstructures have the potential to become the next generation of superalloys, but alloy compositions and processing steps must be optimized to improve coarsening, creep, and rafting behavior. While these behaviors are different than in nickel-based superalloys, alloy development can be accelerated by understanding the thermodynamic factors influencing microstructure evolution. In this work, we develop a phase field model informed by first-principles density functional theory and experimental data to predict the equilibrium shapes of Co-Al-W gamma ' precipitates. Three-dimensional simulations of single and multiple precipitates are performed to understand the effect of elastic and interfacial energy on coarsened and rafted microstructures; the elastic energy is dependent on the elastic stiffnesses, misfit strain, precipitate size, applied stress, and precipitate spatial distribution. We observe characteristic microstructures dependent on the type of applied stress that have the same gamma ' morphology and orientation seen in experiments, indicating that the elastic stresses arising from coherent gamma/gamma ' interfaces are important for morphological evolution-during creep. The results also indicate that the narrow gamma channels between gamma ' precipitates are energetically favored, and provide an explanation for the experimentally observed directional coarsening that occurs without any applied stress.

Characterization of the powders was performed by using X-Ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and particle-size analyzer. Consolidated samples were also characterized in terms of density, microhardness and hardness. In order to promote the dual gamma/gamma' microstructure, both alloys were aged after solution annealing heat treatment, improving a new route of consolidation with a new level of performance.

TI Influence of rhenium on gamma '-strengthened cobalt-base superalloys
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS RESEARCH
AB The element Re is known to be a very potent strengthener concerning the creep properties of Ni-base superalloys. In this paper the influence of Re on the properties of new gamma'-strengthened Co-base superalloys is addressed. Atom probe tomography reveals that Re partitions preferentially to the gamma phase, but not as pronounced as in ni-base superalloys. Nanoindentation and micro-pillar compression tests of the gamma' phase indicate an increase of the hardness and the critical resolved shear stress caused by a considerable concentration of Re in the gamma' phase. Creep investigations show that the positive effect of Re is by far not as pronounced as in Ni-base superalloys. Several effects, which can contribute to this behavior, such as the lower Re concentration in gamma and hence a slightly reduced effective diffusion coefficient, a smaller diffusion barrier of Re in Cocompared to Ni, a slightly lower lattice misfit and gamma' volume fraction of the Re-containing alloy, are discussed.

TI Synthesis of a new tungsten-free gamma-gamma ' cobalt-based superalloy
   by tuning alloying additions
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB The paper presents the synthesis of a new class of gamma-gamma' cobalt-based superalloy that is free of tungsten as an alloying addition. It has much lower density and higher specific strength than the existing cobalt-based superalloys. The current superalloys have a base composition of Co-10Al and are further tuned by the addition of a binary combination of molybdenum and niobium, with the optimum composition of Co-10Al-5Mo-2Nb. The solvus temperature of the alloy (866 degrees C) can be further enhanced above 950 C by the addition of Ni to give the form Co-xNi-10Al-5Mo-2Nb, where x can be from 0 to 30 at.%. After heat treatment, these alloys exhibit a duplex microstructure with coherent cuboidal L1(2)-ordered precipitates (gamma') throughout the face-centred cubic matrix (gamma), yielding a microstructure that is very similar to nickel-based superalloys as well as recently developed Co-Al-W-based alloys. We show that the stability of the gamma' phase improves significantly with the nickel addition, which can be attributed to the increase in solvus temperature. A very high specific 0.2% proof stress of 94.3 MPa g(-1) cm(-3) at room temperature and 63.8 MPa g(-1) cm(-3) at 870 degrees C were obtained for alloy Co-30Ni-10Al-5Mo-2Nb. The remarkably high specific strength of these alloys makes this class of alloy a promising material for use at high temperature, including gas turbine applications. (C) 2014 Acta Materialia Inc.

TI Effect of Al content on the high-temperature oxidation of
   Co-20Cr-(5,10)Al oxide dispersion strengthened superalloys
SO CORROSION SCIENCE
AB The high-temperature oxidation of Co-based oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) Co-20Cr-(5, 10) Al-2.4Hf-1.5Y(2)O(3) (wt%) superalloys was investigated at 900 C-omicron and 1000 C-omicron. The 10Al (wt%) superalloys possess better oxidation resistance with the formation of alumina scale than the 5Al (wt%) with a duplex scale of CoCr2O4/Cr2O3 and internal Al2O3. The alumina on the 10Al superalloy is composed of theta- and alpha-alumina at 900 C-omicron but dominated by alpha-alumina at 1000 C-omicron. The lower weight gain of 10Al superalloys at 1000 C-omicron than at 900 C-omicron was associated with different growth mechanisms of the Al2O3 scales. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Although Ni-base superalloys meet the gas turbine needs of today, they are used very close to their melting range. Demands for applications at higher temperatures are presently met partly through component cooling and application of thermal barrier coatings. However, this approach can not be sustained indefinitely unless the base metal melting temperature is also significantly increased. Rhenium addition can substantially increase the melting point in Co-base alloys and thereby provide a unique opportunity in the development of new alloys for very high temperatures - e.g. for applications at +100 degrees C metal temperature above present day single crystal Ni-base superalloys. The design considerations behind the Co-Re alloy development are presented in this paper. Selected results from the alloy development studies are also presented.

TI Effect of alloying on the oxidation behaviour of Co-Al-W superalloys
SO CORROSION SCIENCE
AB The 800 degrees C isothermal and cyclic oxidation of alloys based on Co-7A1-7W (at.%) was examined. Cr, Fe and Si additions were beneficial. Repeated oxide bilayers formed during cycling of non-Cr alloys, which were not protective (>100 mu m thick). In these layers, the outer was Co3O4 and the inner, a porous Co3O4 and Al2O3 mixture. 10 at.% Cr substitution for Co was sufficient to produce a protective, similar to 1 mu m thick scale which contained an outer layer of Al2CoO4, a very thin (100 nm) middle layer of Cr2O3 and an inner layer of Al2O3. Therefore protective oxide scales are possible in gamma/gamma', Co-Co-3(AL,W) superalloys. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Elemental partitioning, lattice misfit and creep behaviour of Cr
   containing gamma ' strengthened Co base superalloys
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Novel Cr containing Co-Al-W base superalloys were studied by atom probe tomography and neutron diffraction. Cr is found to predominantly partition to the gamma matrix decrease partitioning of W to gamma'. Furthermore, Cr significantly enhances the gamma' volume fraction, decreases the gamma/gamma' lattice misfit and deteriorates the creep resistance. Addition of Ni to the Cr containing alloys affects partitioning of W and Al, further decreases the lattice misfit and results in the formation of irregularly shaped precipitates. Al, W and Cr tend to occupy the 'B' sublattice in the gamma'-A(3)B phase (L1(2) type), while Co and Ni reside in the 'A' sublattice.

The potentials describe structural, thermodynamic, deformation and defect properties of solid solution phases or compound phases in reasonable agreements with experiments or first-principles calculations. The results demonstrate the transferability of the potentials and their applicability to large-scale atomistic simulations to investigate the effect of an alloying element, cobalt, on various microstructural factors related to mechanical properties of Ni-based superalloys on an atomic scale.

AB An emerging class of cobalt-based gamma'-strengthened alloys promises higher temperature capabilities compared to current Ni-base superalloys commonly used in aerospace and power generation applications. As with Ni-base alloys, high temperature coatings that enhance environmental resistance are desirable. Single crystal samples of Co-9.2Al-9.0W and Co-7.8Al-7.8W-4.5Cr-2.0Ta (at.%) were coated with vapour phase nickel aluminide and MCrAlY. Samples were subjected to cyclic oxidation at 1100 C with 300450 1-h cycles. Compared to NiAl-based coatings, the MCrAlY coatings exhibited superior adherence and an interdiffusion zone free of detrimental intermetallic phases. Evolution of microstructure during cycling is discussed with reference to the available thermodynamic data. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In order to study the effect of Cr and Y2O3 addition on the oxidation behavior of novel Co-20Cr-10Al (wt.%) oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) superalloys, an isothermal oxidation test was carried out at 900 degrees C in air. The addition of Cr altered the oxide scale from the multilayered scale with an external Co oxide/CoAl2O4 and an inner Al2O3 to a single Al2O3 scale. Y2O3 addition increased oxidation mass gain slightly but improved spallation resistance of the external Al2O3 scale.

TI Creep deformation of single crystals of new Co-Al-W-based alloys with
   fcc/L1(2) two-phase microstructures
SO PHILOSOPHICAL MAGAZINE
AB The creep deformation behaviour of single crystals of Co-Al-W-based alloys with gamma + gamma' two-phase microstructures has been investigated in tension under a constant stress of 137MPa in air at 1000 degrees C as a function of the gamma' solvus temperature and the volume fraction of the gamma' phase. When described by the creep strain rate versus time curve, the creep deformation of Co-Al-W-based alloys consists of transition and accelerating regions without a steady-state region, as observed in many modern nickel-based alloys. However, the creep strength of the present Co-Al-W-based alloys is comparable with nickel-based superalloys of the first generation but is much weaker than those of the second and higher generations. Unlike in nickel-based superalloys, the so-called p (parallel)-type raft structure, in which the gamma' phase is elongated along the tensile axis direction, is formed during creep in Co-Al-W-based alloys, being consistent with what is expected from the positive values of lattice misfit between the gamma and gamma' phases. As a result, of the alloys investigated, the best creep properties are obtained with the alloy possessing the highest volume fraction (85%) of the gamma' phase, which is far larger than usual for nickel-based superalloys (55-60%).

AB The influence of various alloying elements on the creep properties of polycrystalline Co-base superalloys hardened by a ternary L1(2) compound, Co-3(Al,W) (gamma'-phase), was investigated. A Ti containing quaternary alloy shows creep strength similar to Ni-base superalloys IN100 and IN713C at 850 degrees C and strongly superior to conventional Co-base superalloys as Haynes188. The activation energy for creep between 850 and 950 degrees C is similar to the polycrystalline Ni-base superalloy IN100 in the same temperature range. Strengthening of the grain boundaries by third phase precipitates was found to be crucial for the mechanical properties. This can be achieved either by precipitation of borides or by additional intermetallic phases which precipitate due to oversaturation. During compressive creep at 850 degrees C only a slight tendency for directional coarsening occurs, while at 950 degrees C distinct gamma/gamma'-rafts perpendicular to the external compressive stress axis are formed which indicate a positive lattice misfit even at 950 degrees C.

TI Effects of cobalt on creep rupture properties and dislocation structures

SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB The influences of cobalt (Co) on creep rupture lives and dislocation structures in nickel base superalloys with and without rhenium (Re) are investigated. The creep rupture test conditions were high temperature low stress (1100 degrees C/150 MPa), intermediate temperature and stress (982 degrees C, 1010 degrees C) and low temperature high stress (850 degrees C/586 MPa). The results show that increasing Co content could enhance the creep rupture lives at low and intermediate temperature, and does not degrade the creep rupture lives of alloys at high temperature. In Re-containing alloys, at high temperature low stress (1100 degrees C/150 MPa), the effects of Co on the dislocation structures are negligible, while at low temperature high stress (850 degrees C/586 MPa), stacking faults are generated in alloy with 12% Co, and in alloy with 3% Co and free of Co, gamma prime particles are sheared by dislocation pairs. In Re-free alloys, at intermediate temperature and stress (1010 degrees C/248 MPa), large quantities of stacking faults appear in alloy without Co, while in alloy having 12% Co, gamma prime particles are sheared by dislocation pairs coupled by anti-phase boundary (APB). The gamma prime sheared by stacking faults or by dislocation pairs coupled by APB depends on the competition of stacking faults energy and APB energy which is affected by temperature and the interaction of Re and Co.

TI Effect of Al and W Contents on the Solidification and Solution
   Microstructure of Novel gamma/gamma ' Cobalt-Base Superalloys
SO ADVANCED ENGINEERING MATERIALS
AB The solidification and heat treatment characteristics of superalloys are key to engineering and practical applications. The solidification and solid solution behavior of gamma/gamma ' cobalt-base superalloys Co-30Ni-xAl-(15 - x)W-5Cr-1Ta-4Ti (x = 7, 9, 11 abbreviated as 7Al8W, 9Al6W, and 11Al4W, respectively) are studied using directional solidification experiments. The results indicate that there are Laves phase, (gamma + gamma ')(e) eutectics, and (beta + gamma ')(e) eutectics in the interdendritic regions for the 7Al8W alloy. The solidification sequence of the 7Al8W alloy is L -> L-1 + gamma -> L-2 + gamma + Laves -> L-3 + gamma + Laves + (beta + gamma ')(e) -> L-4 + gamma + Laves + (beta + gamma ')(e) + (gamma + gamma ')(e) -> gamma + Laves + (beta + gamma ')(e) + (gamma + gamma ')(e). As the Al content increases and the W content decreases, the Laves phase fraction in the alloy decreases and the (beta + gamma ')(e) eutectics fraction increases. The Laves phase completely disappears in the 11Al4W alloy. An unremovable mu phase forms in the 7Al8W alloy during solution treatment. The 9Al6W alloy and 11Al4W alloy can exhibit a gamma single-phase microstructure after single-stage solution treatment (1250 degrees C for 1 h) and two-stage solution treatment (1210 degrees C for 1 h + 1275 degrees C for 1 h), respectively. These experimental results are helpful for composition optimization, solidification, and solution treatment parameter determination of novel gamma/gamma ' cobalt-base superalloys.

SO METALLOGRAPHY MICROSTRUCTURE AND ANALYSIS
AB Superalloys are widely used for high-temperature applications. But these alloys also suffered from severe degradation where corrosion problem frequently encountered due to the presence of molten salt deposits. To obviate this problem, three nickel-and cobalt-based superalloys had been exposed to (Na2SO4-25% NaCl) at 900 degrees C for 100 cycles. The resulting corrosion products were characterized using scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy. It was observed that both Ni-based alloys exhibited improved corrosion resistance over the Co-based alloy in this aggressive environment. In Ni-based alloys, the scale contained oxides such as NiO, Cr2O3, Fe2O3, and spinel NiCr2O4, whereas in case of Co-based alloy, the scale contained CoO and CoNiO2.

TI Dependence of titanium carbide stability at elevated temperatures on Co
   content in Co(Ni)-25Cr-1.6Ti-0.4C superalloys
SO MATERIALS CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
AB Titanium carbides feature among the MC carbides which tend to crystallize with a script-like shape recognized to be favorable to mechanical strength at high temperature for equi-axed cast refractory alloys. Recent results demonstrated that script-like TiC can be successfully obtained in Co-based alloys while they are less stable than chromium carbides in nickel-based alloys. The present work aims to study whether the addition of cobalt to nickel-based alloys may stabilize TiC. This double investigation, by thermodynamic calculations and by the elaboration of a series of nickel-based alloys with an increasing part of cobalt, demonstrates that the progressive enrichment in cobalt tends favoring the presence of TiC instead chromium carbides. To obtain a majority of TiC, script-like shaped and in significant quantity, cobalt must be more present than nickel in the alloys. But this enrichment in cobalt deteriorates the good resistance against hot oxidation. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Coarsening behaviour and interfacial structure of gamma ' precipitates
   in Co-Al-W based superalloys
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB This work discusses the effects of alloying on the coarsening behaviour of the L1(2) ordered gamma' phase and the structure of the gamma/gamma' interfaces in three Co-Al-W base superalloys aged at similar to 90 degrees C below the respective solvus temperatures: Co-7Al-7W, Co-10Al-5W-2Ta and Co-7Al-7W-20Ni (at.%). The coarsening kinetics are adequately characterised by the classical Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner model for Ostwald ripening. Co-7Al-7W exhibited much slower coarsening than its quaternary derivatives. Alloying can be exploited to modify the coarsening kinetics either by increasing the solvus temperature by adding tantalum, or by adding nickel to shift the rate controlling mechanism towards dependence on the diffusion of aluminium rather than tungsten. Lattice resolution STEM imaging was used to measure the widths of the order disorder (structural) and Z-contrast (compositional) gradients across the gamma/gamma' interfaces. Similarly to nickel base superalloys, the compositional gradient was found to be wider than the structural. Co-7Al-7W-20Ni had much wider interface gradients than Co-7Al-7W and Co-10Al-5W-2Ta, which suggests that its gamma' phase stoichiometry is less constrained. A possible correlation between temperature and misfit normalised r vs. t(1/3) coarsening rate coefficients and the structural gradient width has also been identified, whereby alloys with wider interfaces exhibit faster coarsening rates.

   Case Study on a Co-Base Superalloy Oxide Scale

AB Herein, the capabilities of a correlative tomography approach combining laboratory nano X-ray computed tomography, focused ion-beam sectioning, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy are utilized for the characterization of multilayered oxide scales of Co-base superalloys regarding their 3D morphology and chemical composition. The combination of complementary 3D imaging techniques allows for a precise and reliable segmentation of the pore space, oxide precipitates, and different phases of the initial material. Such information is instrumental to a microscopic understanding of oxidation in this new class of superalloys and key to improvement of oxidation resistance in the next-generation high-temperature materials.

CL Sendai, JAPAN
AB The diffusion in Ni-Co-Re and Ni-Co-Ru systems have been investigated in the temperature range 1323-1523 K through the determination of the interdiffusion coefficients. The main interdiffusion coefficients of these systems were larger than the cross interdiffusion coefficients, indicating that the influences of the own concentration gradients of the elements were generally still dominant. From the ratio of the cross interdiffusion coefficient to the main one, |(D) over tilde (k)(ij)/(D) over tilde (k)(ii)|, it was found that the effect of Co on the diffusion of Re was more appreciable than that of Ru. Moreover, by the comparison between the diffusion in the binary Ni-Re and in the ternary Ni-Co-Re, it was clear that the presence of Co reduced the Re diffusivity in Ni. The results of this work reflect two folds; the attractive force exists between Co and Re, and the interatomic bonding of Co-Re seems to be stronger than that of Ni-Re.

TI Effects of Co content on tensile properties and deformation behaviors of
   Ni-based disk superalloys at different temperatures
SO MATERIALS & DESIGN
AB Tensile properties of three Ni-based disk superalloys with 5 wt.%, 15 wt.% and 23 wt.% Co contents were investigated from room temperature (RT) to 725 degrees C with a constant strain rate of 3 x 10(-4) s(-1). It is found that addition of Co enhances the yield strength and the strain hardening capacity of the alloy in the studied temperature regime. It is due to the following two reasons: i.e. the interactions between a large volume fraction of fine secondary and tertiary gamma' precipitates with the dislocations in slip bands at lower temperatures and the formation of deformation microtwins at higher temperatures. However, the formation of deformation microtwins in the high Co-containing content alloy sharply decreases the ductility at higher temperatures. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Thermodynamic Considerations of Contamination by Alloying Elements of

SO METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS B-PROCESS METALLURGY AND
   MATERIALS PROCESSING SCIENCE
AB Cobalt and nickel are high-value commodity metals and are mostly used in the form of highly alloyed materials. The alloying elements used may cause contamination problems during recycling. To ensure maximum resource efficiency, an understanding of the removability of these alloying elements and the controllability of some of the primary alloying elements is essential with respect to the recycling of end-of-life (EoL) nickel- and cobalt-based superalloys by remelting. In this study, the distribution behaviors of approximately 30 elements that are usually present in EoL nickel- and cobalt-based superalloys in the solvent metal (nickel, cobalt, or nickel-cobalt alloy), oxide slag, and gas phases during the remelting were quantitatively evaluated using a thermodynamic approach. The results showed that most of the alloying elements can be removed either in the slag phase or into the gas phase. However, the removal of copper, tin, arsenic, and antimony by remelting is difficult, and they remain as tramp elements during the recycling. On the other hand, the distribution tendencies of iron, molybdenum, and tungsten can be controlled by changing the remelting conditions. To increase the resource efficiency of recycling, preventing contamination by the tramp elements and identifying the alloying compositions of EoL superalloys are significantly essential, which will require the development of efficient prior alloy-sorting systems and advanced separation technologies.

AB The influence of several alloying elements on the microstructure and creep properties of polycrystalline Co-base superalloys hardened with the ternary Ll(2) compound, gamma'-Co-3( Al, W), are presented in this work. The stability of the gamma/gamma'-microstructure was investigated by long term aging at temperatures of 750 degrees C and 900 degrees C. High contents of chromium and iron destabilize the gamma/gamma'-microstructure. Additions of nickel widen the gamma/gamma'- two phase field. Discontinuous precipitation is observed only in the iridium-containing alloy during aging. In all other alloys no formation of further intermetallic phases are found even after 1000 hrs aging at 750 degrees C and 900 degrees C. Boron has been added for the formation of grain boundary strengthening intermetallic phases which leads to an adjacent gamma'-depleted zone. Nanoindentation shows that titanium improves its hardness. The creep strength of the studied alloys is sufficiently better than that of commercial carbide hardened polycrystalline Co-base superalloys and already close to gamma'-hardened Ni-base superalloys. An alloy containing 2 at.% titanium exhibited a creep strength comparable with the Ni-base alloy IN 100. The microstructure after creep tests at 950 degrees C showed rafting perpendicular to the compressive load axis, confirming the positive lattice misfit of the alloys at high temperatures which was determined with high energy X-ray diffraction.

TI Creep strength of Co-free Ni-base single crystal superalloys
SO JOURNAL OF THE JAPAN INSTITUTE OF METALS
AB The Pebble Bed Modular Reactor (PBMR) is a small atomic power reactor which can be used in areas where the electric power transmission network is not well developed. It generates electricity by gas-turbines that used He-gas as a coolant. Ni-based superalloys are the primary materials used in gas-turbines. However if conventional Ni-base superalloys are to be used for PBMR, turbine maintenances will be difficult due to Co, as it can produce Co-60 a recitative material that possesses a long half-life. Therefore, Co-free Ni-base superalloys are required for PBMR.
   In this paper, a Co-free single-crystal (SC) superalloy, TMS-82 + (-Co), was developed; it was the same chemical composition as the 2(nd) generation SC superalloy, TMS-82+, except that it is Co-free creep tests were performed on the developed alloy, TMS-82 +, under three conditions; 900 degrees C/392 MPa, 1000 degrees C/245 MPa, and 1100 degrees C/137 MPa; CMSX-4, a popular SC alloy, was used as comparison.
   TMS-82 + (-Co) displayed superior creep-rupture life in all creep tests; however, detrimental TCP were observed in the microstructure of the sample that underwent creep testing at 1100 degrees C/137 MPa. This, the developed Co-free SC alloy should be further modified for long-term microstructural stability. Elimination of phase formation will allow the alloy to be utilized in the PBMR.

TI Isothermal aging of a gamma '-strengthened Co-Al-W alloy coated with
   vacuum plasma-sprayed MCrAlY bond coats
SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB Cobalt-based superalloys with a gamma/gamma' microstructure were discovered in 2006 and are currently being investigated as an alternative to nickel-based superalloys for high-temperature, high-load applications in gas turbine blades. They promise a better castability combined with a similar creep strength. Superalloy turbine blades are commonly coated with oxidation resistant bond coats. For this reason their compatibility needs to be studied. Co-9Al-9W specimens with a gamma/gamma' microstructure were coated with either a nickel-based or cobalt-based MCrAlY bond coat using vacuum plasma spraying. After aging at 900 degrees C in air for up to 500 h no decomposition of the gamma' phase was found in the bulk superalloy. The interdiffusion zone shows several different W-rich topologically close-packed phases arising from the dissolution of the gamma' phase in this region. The W-rich phases are identified to be mu phase for both bond coats and R phase for the nickel-based bond coat only. Their total volume is higher for the nickel-based bond coat. Therefore the cobalt-based bond coat is better suited for the Co-based superalloy substrate. Room temperature hardness and Young's modulus were measured using nanoindentation in the initial state and after heat treatment. A significantly higher Young's modulus was found for the cobalt-based bond coat (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we achieved the Co modified aluminide coating on nickel base superalloys by pack cementation process. The corrosion currents (i(corr)) of coated and uncoated substrate after 1 h of immersion tested by potentiodynamic polarization in 3.5 wt% NaCl solutions are 9.73b x 10(-7) A/cm(2) and 1.31 x 10(-6) A/cm(2), respectively. With the immersion time extension, the i(corr) of the coating decreases and the values of vertical bar Z vertical bar by EIS increase, indicating that the electrochemical reaction rate of the coating becomes slower. The coating presents good corrosion resistance due to the Al2O3 formed on the surface.

TI The segregation of elements in high-refractory-content single-crystal
   nickel-based superalloys
SO JOM
AB Nickel-based superalloys are complex alloys that contain ten to 15 elements that are widely used in industries where high-temperature strength and corrosion resistance are required. Alloy additions commonly include Cr, Co, W, Ta, Al, P, Re, Mo, and, in some alloys, Ru. Each of these additions can affect the as-cast microstructure due to differences in elemental segregation. A better understanding of the effects of typical additions to nickel-based superalloys on the segregation of the elements in the alloy can help identify potential improvements in the processing of current alloys and the development of new alloys. Therefore, the effects of several common alloying additions on solidification segregation and defects were evaluated. In general, an increase in the degree of elemental segregation was observed with increases in each of the elements listed except cobalt and molybdenum. Increased levels of cobalt and molybdenum resulted in reductions in the segregation of most of the elements in the alloy.

SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB The Co-Ta-V and Co-Nb-V ternary systems are investigated in a search for L1(2)-ordered gamma' precipitation, based on recent computational predictions of stable gamma+gamma' microstructures. Four alloys with nominal (at. %) composition Co-6Ta-6V, Co-5.4Ta-6.6V-xNi (x = 0 and 10), and Co-6Nb-6V are arc-melted, homogenized at 1250 degrees C, and aged at 900 degrees C for 2,16 and 64 h. Nanometric, cuboidal gamma' precipitates within a fcc-gamma matrix are discovered in the Co-Ta-V system after aging for 2 h, and in the Co-Nb-V system after cooling from homogenization. The compositions of these two new gamma'-phases, as measured via atom probe tomography, are Co-3(Ta0.76V0.24) and Co-3(Nb0.65V0.35), respectively. Upon aging at 900 degrees C, the gamma' precipitates coarsen, dissolve and transform to lamellar C36-Co-3(Ta,V) and needle-shape DO19-CO3(Nb,V), measured as Co-3(Nb0.81V0.19) by APT, respectively. This shows that these ternary gamma' phases are metastable and points to the need for their stabilization via additional alloying elements. (C) 2018 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

   strengthened superalloys
SO MATERIALS CHARACTERIZATION
AB In order to develop Co-based oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) superalloys with excellent mechanical properties and oxidation resistance at the temperature above 1000 degrees C, Co-20Cr-(5,10)Al ODS superalloys were designed and fabricated by mechanical alloying (MA), spark plasma sintering (SPS), hot rolling and the final annealing at 1200 degrees C. Two different phases were identified; the Co solid solution of a fcc structure, and the B2 phase highly enriched with Aluminum. Composition and volume fraction of both phases are almost consistent with the Co-Cr-Al ternary phase diagram computed with the Pandat software. Another coarse fcc phase with smaller content of oxide particles was also characterized. This phase was probably formed through an incipient melting at the initial stage of SPS process. Fine oxides particles are densely distributed inside both, the fcc solid solution and the B2 phase. Grain boundaries and phase boundaries are decorated with the oxide particles, which are beneficial to grains and phases stability at elevated temperature. The observed unique core-shell structure was characterized as Y2Hf7O17 type in a core and Y2Hf2O7 type at a periphery of the oxide particles. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Microstructure evolution of cobalt aluminide coating on nickel-based
   superalloys during exposure at 1050 degrees C
SO VACUUM
AB Cobalt aluminide coating was deposited onto two directionally solidified Ni-based superalloys (DZ 466 and DS GTD111) by low-pressure chemical vapor deposition. Interdiffusion behaviors of the two coating/superalloy systems were examined during long-term thermal exposure at 1050 degrees C. It was observed that the inward diffusion of Al and Co from the coating to the substrate and the outward diffusion of Ni and refractory elements such as W, Ta and Cr etc. from the substrate occurred during annealing. This phenomenon induced the degradation of coating matrix and several precipitations of chromium containing phases. Degradation rate and precipitate categories are of great differences for the two studied superalloys. The initial precipitates presented in the coating system had a morphological heredity-effect (MHE) to the final Upsilon phase microstructure. Mechanism referred to elements distribution was discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Diffusion and gamma ' phase coarsening kinetics in ruthenium containing
   nickel based alloys
SO MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS
AB The present paper reports the interdiffusion of Re, W, Ru and Co in the binary and pseudo-binary Ni based alloys at 1523 K and the gamma' phase coarsening kinetics of model superalloys at 1324 K. Both Re and W concentration gradients caused Ru uphill diffusion in the respective pseudo-binary diffusion couple, whereas Ru concentration gradient promoted uphill diffusion for W but not for Re. Interestingly, Re uphill diffusion occurred under the influence of Co concentration gradient but the reverse effect was not observed. The cross interdiffusion coefficients qualitatively determined from the uphill diffusion profiles were in reasonable agreement with those reported previously. Comparison of the interdiffusion coefficients in the binary and the pseudo-binary diffusion couples showed that Ru and W decreased the diffusivity of each other whereas Co appeared to be more powerful barrier atoms than Ru to decrease the Re diffusivity. Furthermore, it was evident that the coarsening kinetics of the gamma' phase in both Ru-free and Ru-containing model superalloys were controlled by diffusion and Ru was found to have no effect on the rate constant of the gamma' phase coarsening.

SO SCRIPTA MATERIALIA
AB The influence of W, Ta, Ti, Nb, V, Si, Mo, Ir and Cr on the high temperature properties of gamma/gamma'-strengthened Co-Al-W superalloys was investigated. All alloys exhibited a gamma/gamma' microstructure with remarkably differing gamma' volume fractions. W, Ta, Ti, Nb and V increased the gamma' volume fraction and gamma' solvus temperature. An increased W content and alloying of additional elements, except Ir, decreased the liquidus temperature. First creep experiments revealed a creep strength comparable with polycrystalline Ni-base superalloys and the importance of grain boundary strengthening. (c) 2010 Acta Materialia Inc.

TI High resolution energy dispersive spectroscopy mapping of planar defects
   in L1(2)-containing Co-base superalloys
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB Local chemical fluctuations in the vicinity of superlattice intrinsic stacking faults (SISFs) have been observed via high resolution energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping in new single crystal Co- and CoNi-base superalloys containing gamma'-(L1(2)) precipitates. The SISFs were formed during high temperature tensile creep at 900 degrees C. Chemical fluctuations were found to greatly influence the SISF energy, which was calculated from density functional theory in Co-3(Al, Ta, W) compounds at 0K. The local SISF structure was found to be comprised of four D0(19) (0001) planes that were enriched in W and Ta, as revealed by high resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HRSTEM) imaging and EDS mapping. The precipitates were determined to accommodate up to 22% of the plastic deformation accrued during an interrupted creep test to 0.6% creep strain. The driving forces for segregation are discussed, and new models for shearing of the ordered precipitates are proposed. (C) 2015 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI The influence of yttrium addition on thermogravimetric behaviour of new
   Co-10Al-5Mo-2Nb Co-based superalloy
SO OCHRONA PRZED KOROZJA
AB Characterization of oxidation resistance of new type of cobalt based superalloys were presented in this investigations. As a referential material the Co-10Al-5Mo-2Nb (at.%) was used as the tungsten-free version of basic Co-7Al-7W alloy. The investigated alloy was modified by addition of yttrium on the level of 0.5 at.% due to expectation of improvement of it oxidation resistance. Both Co-based superalloys were casted in Institute of Materials Engineering of Silesian University of Technology in Poland. The oxidation performance of alloys were made during thermogravimetric investigations at temperature range from 25 to 1200 degrees C. The main analyzed parameter was mass gain detected continuously during the test. After the test the overall and cross-sectional analysis of specimens was made. They included analysis of oxide layer morphology on the surface of specimens with characterization of phase constituent of oxide layer. The detailed analysis of oxidized layer was made by scanning electron microscopy method where distribution of alloying elements was made with special attentions on yttrium localization after the test in oxide zone. Obtained data showed that addition of Y has a strong influence on oxidation performance of new Co based superalloy. Those influence is demonstrated mainly by different morphology of final oxide zone with strong influence on Mo and Nb diffusion.

AB Five novel Co-30N1-(6 + x)Al-(3-y)W-yMo-1Ta-3.5Ti-12Cr-0.1Hf-0.025 C (x = 0, y = 0, 1, and x = 2, y = 0, 1, 2 at%) multi-component polycrystalline gamma'-strengthened Co-base superalloys are designed to investigate the effects of Al and Mo content on the microstructure and properties in this study. Based on the 6Al3W alloy, the addition of 2 at% Al has the effects of increasing the gamma' solvus temperature, reducing the density, increasing the gamma' volume fraction and coarsening rate, reducing the Vickers hardness but increasing the yield strength at 750 degrees C. The replacement of 1 at% W by 1 at% Mo remarkably reduced the density with a negligible effect on the gamma' coarsening rate; Meanwhile, this slightly reduced the gamma' solvus temperature and volume fraction causing a slight decrease of Vickers hardness and yield strength at 750 degrees C. The experimental alloys all show relatively low density, large processing window, good microstructure stability at 750 degrees C and mechanical properties, especially for 6Al2W1Mo alloy which has density of 8.69 g cm(-3), processing window of 247 degrees C, room-temperature Vickers hardness of 5.1 GPa, stable microstructure without detrimental phase after a heat treatment of 900 degrees C @8 h + 750 degrees C @1000 h. These results may provide guidance for the development of the novel wrought Co-base superalloys with high performance and low density.

AB Polycrystalline Co-Al-W alloys with quaternary alloying substitutions have been studied to investigate whether this alloy system might be attractive as an alternative to Ni-base superalloys in high temperature applications. A process route for the alloys was developed and an initial aging heat treatment established. The initial findings indicate that the addition of Ti, Ta and Ni increases the solvus temperature, whereas the addition of Mo lowers it slightly. The addition of Ti, Ta and Ni to the base alloy increased the gamma' precipitate size, whereas the addition of Mo had a negligible effect. Diffraction measurements were performed using both X-ray and neutron scattering. Positive lattice misfit values were obtained at both room and elevated temperatures; moreover, the lattice misfit increased with temperature. The thermal expansion coefficient of the gamma phase was similar to reference data for Co, whereas the gamma' phase had a greater thermal expansion coefficient than the gamma phase. Finally, cyclic oxidation experiments have been carried out in air at 800 degrees C. The CoO scales grown were not protective, and the alloys suffered from spallation during cooling.

AB The effect of 2 at.% Ru addition on the elemental partitioning and microstructural evolution of a base Co-8.8Al-7.3W at.% superalloy, consisting of a gamma-(fcc) matrix with gamma'-(L1(2) structure) precipitates is studied using scanning electron microscopy and atom-probe tomography. Ruthenium partitions to the gamma'-precipitates in the Co-9.4A1-7.5W-2.1Ru at.% alloy with a partitioning coefficient, K-Ru(gamma'/gamma) = 1.27, after aging at 900 degrees C for 16 h, in contrast to the behavior observed in Ni-base superalloys and theoretically predicted for Co-base superalloys, for which Ru partitions preferentially to the gamma-phase. The addition of ruthenium does not significantly affect the gamma' volume-fraction or the coarsening kinetics of the gamma' precipitates compared to the base ternary alloy. The addition of Ru also leads, however, to a rapid discontinuous transformation of (gamma plus gamma'), which initiates at the grain boundaries after 128 h aging at 900 degrees C; (gamma plus gamma') is transformed into a lamellar phase mixture containing Co3W (D0(19)), fcc solid-solution (gamma), and Co(Al,W) (B2). After 256 h aging at 900 degrees C in the Ru-containing alloy, some grains have completely transformed, although regions of gamma plus gamma' persist. The base ternary Co Al W alloy does not exhibit a discontinuous transformation and contains a (gamma plus gamma') microstructure up to 1024 h of aging at 900 degrees C. (C) 2016 Acta Materialia Inc.

TI Effect of Alloying Elements on Friction and Wear Performance of Novel
   Co-Al-W Superalloys
SO RARE METAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING
AB Novel Co-Al-W superalloy is a novel Co-base superalloy, with the precipitation strengthening by a ternary compound gamma'-Co-3(Al,W) phase on gamma-Co matrix. The effect of alloying element Mo, Nb, Ta and Ti on friction and wear performance of Co-Al-W superalloys at room temperature was studied by THT07-135 type friction and wear tester and SEM, and cobalt-based Stellite 6 alloy was employed for comparison. Results show that the friction coefficient of 9.8W superalloy is smaller than that of cobalt-based Stellite 6. Alloying elements Mo, Nb and Ti can moderately reduce wear mass loss and friction coefficient of 9.8W superalloy, and improve the wear resistance. The Mo, Ti and Nb elements can clearly improve the wear resistance of 9.8W superalloy while the effect of Ta element is not obvious. The wear mechanism of Co-Al-W superalloy is mainly oxidation and abrasive wear, while that of Stellite 6 alloy mainly is delamination and abrasive wear.

TI A computational high-throughput search for new ternary superalloys
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB In 2006, a novel cobalt-based superalloy was discovered [1] with mechanical properties better than some conventional nickel-based superalloys. As with conventional superalloys, its high performance arises from the precipitate-hardening effect of a coherent L1(2) phase, which is in two-phase equilibrium with the fcc matrix. Inspired by this unexpected discovery of an L1(2) ternary phase, we performed a first principles search through 2224 ternary metallic systems for analogous precipitate-hardening phases of the form X-3[A(0.5),B-0.5], where X = Ni, Co, or Fe, and [A,B] = Li, Be, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn Ga, Sr, Y, Zr, Nb, Mo, Tc, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, Cd, In, Sn, Sb, Hf, Ta, W, Re, Os, Ir, Pt, Au, Hg, or Tl. We found 102 systems that have a smaller decomposition energy and a lower formation enthalpy than the Co-3(Al, W) superalloy. They have a stable two-phase equilibrium with the host matrix within the concentration range 0 < x < 1 (X-3[A(x),B1-x]) and have a relative lattice mismatch with the host matrix of less than or equal to 5%. These new candidates, narrowed from 2224 systems, suggest possible experimental exploration for identifying new superalloys. Of these 102 systems, 37 are new; they have no reported phase diagrams in standard databases. Based on cost, experimental difficulty, and toxicity, we limit these 37 to a shorter list of six promising candidates of immediate interest. Our calculations are consistent with current experimental literature where data exists. (C) 2016 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI On the grain boundary strengthening effect of boron in gamma/gamma '
   Cobalt-base superalloys
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB Boron is an essential solute element for improving the grain boundary strength in several high temperature metallic alloys especially in Ni- and Co-base superalloys although the detailed strengthening mechanisms are still not well understood. In superalloys, boron leads to the formation of borides and precipitate depleted zones around the grain boundaries and alters the bond strength among the grains directly. In this paper, we explore in detail the role of the boron content in ternary gamma/gamma' Co-9Al-9W alloys. Local as well as bulk mechanical properties were evaluated using nanoindentation and compression testing and correlated to near-atomic scale microstructure and compositions obtained from electron microscopy and atom probe tomography.
   The alloy variant with low B content (0.005 at.% B) reveals an increase in yield strength at room temperature and 600 degrees C and atom probe tomography investigations show that solute B segregates to the grain boundaries. However, in the bulk B exclusively partitions to the gamma' phase. Additionally, the gamma/gamma' grain boundaries are depleted in W and Al with the concentration locally shifted towards the gamma composition forming a very thin gamma layer at the gamma/gamma' grain boundaries, which supports dislocation mobility in the gamma/gamma' grain boundary region during deformation. Higher content of B (0.04 at.% B) promotes formation of W-rich borides at the grain boundaries that leads to undesirable precipitate depleted zones adjacent to these borides that decrease the strength of the alloy drastically. However, it was also found that a subsequent annealing heat treatment eliminates these detrimental zones by re-precipitating gamma' and thus elevating the strength of the alloy.
   This result shows that, if a precipitate depleted zone can be avoided, B significantly improves the mechanical properties of polycrystalline Co-base superalloys by strengthening the gamma' phase and by improving grain boundary cohesion.

Interrupted creep tests were conducted at 900 degrees C under vacuum at constant load, and stresses varied between 275 and 345 MPa. Transmission electron microscopy diffraction contrast analysis revealed superlattice intrinsic and extrinsic stacking faults in the gamma' precipitates in the Co-base alloys. However, in alloys containing significant additions of nickel (CoNi-base alloys), antiphase boundaries formed by shearing of a/2 < 110 > dislocations on octahedral planes. The shearing mechanisms in the Co- and CoNi-base gamma' phase are compared to commercial Ni-base alloys, and the relative fault energies inferred from these observations are discussed.

TI Effect of Co on microstructural stability of the third generation
   Ni-based single crystal superalloys
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS RESEARCH
AB The effect of Co on element segregation and microstructure is investigated in the third generation Ni-based single crystal superalloys with 4, 8.5, and 11.5 wt% Co addition. The results show that the increase of Co content leads to a severe element segregation in as-cast microstructure. After heat treatment, the size of gamma' phase is slightly reduced with Co content increase. During the thermal exposure, the gamma' phase coarsens gradually but its coarsening rate decreases with increasing Co content. In addition, some acicular and blocky topologically close-packed (TCP) phases are precipitated in 4% Co and 8.5% Co alloys. However, no TCP phase can be found in 11.5% Co alloy. Finally, it may be concluded that although a higher Co content is harmful for the element segregation, it is beneficial to maintain the cuboidal morphology of gamma' phase, decrease its coarsening rate, and impede the precipitation of TCP phase.

SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Tensile properties of a novel Co-20Cr-5Al-2.4Hf-1.5Y(2)O(3) (wt%) oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) superalloy were studied through a comparing investigation with Co-20Cr-5Al (wt%) alloy. Both the Co-based alloys (with and without oxide particles) were fabricated by mechanical alloying (MA), spark plasma sintering (SPS), hot rolling and the final annealing at 1200 degrees C. Due to the ultrafine grains of 500 nm in the ODS superalloy and 1.2 mu m in the ODS free alloy, the metastable fcc structure predominates at room temperature. Tensile testing was conducted at room temperature and 1000 degrees C. Strain-induced twinning deformation was evidenced by transmission electron microscopy and was found to significantly enhance the ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of the two alloys at room temperature. The Co-based ODS superalloy exhibits a superior tensile strength of 2.85 GPa at room temperature, which is associated with the distribution of twins and fine Y-Hf oxides. At 1000 degrees C, since the ultrafine grain size in the ODS superalloys, an easy grain boundary deformation occurred and resulted in a significant reduction in the UTS value. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI Effects of alloying elements on the structural, elastic and
   thermodynamic properties of Co3Ta compounds from first-principles
   calculations
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB In this work, we investigated the effects of alloying elements X (X = Al, Ti, V, Nb, Mo and W) on the structural stability, elastic, electronic and thermodynamic properties of Co3Ta compounds using the density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The investigations of atomic structure reveal that all of the alloying elements prefer to occupy Co sites rather than Ta sites in both the L1(2) and D0(19) structures, by which Mo is found to play the most effective role in the structural stabilization for gamma' phase. Both bulk moduli and shear moduli of Co3Ta compounds are reduced by the additions of alloying elements, except that the shear moduli are slightly increased by alloying Mo and W. By using the quasi-harmonic Debye model, the thermodynamic properties, including thermal expansion coefficients, heat capacity and bulk modulus, are predicted as a function of temperature for these compounds. The results from this work provide fundamental information for the further development of Co-Ta-based superalloys. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI High-temperature corrosion of Inconel (R) Alloy 718, Haynes (R) 282 (R)
   Alloy and CoWAlloy1&2 in supercritical ammonia/ammonium chloride solutio
SO JOURNAL OF CRYSTAL GROWTH
AB Corrosion of process equipment during ammonothermal synthesis at high temperature and pressure is still one of the big limitations of this process because of reduced crystal quality and safety issues. In this paper we present preliminary ammonothermal corrosion experiments with two Ni-base superalloys (Inconel (R) Alloy 718 and Haynes (R) 282 (R) Alloy) and two newly developed Co-base superalloys (CoWAlloy1&2) in a supercritical NH3/NH4Cl-solution (24 h/550 degrees C/105 MPa). After the experiment, the samples were analyzed by their mass change per initial surface area (specific weight change). Additionally, the morphological and elemental changes of the corrosion layers were evaluated. None of the investigated alloys developed a passivation layer and the corrosion layers were very fragile. In agreement with previous studies, the Ni-base alloys showed intergranular attack with severe general corrosive degeneration. Despite their high potential for high-pressure at high-temperature applications and in contrast to a ternary Co-Al-W-alloy, the investigated multinary Co-base alloys were strongly attacked, too. However, CoWAlloy2 presented the lowest specific weight change of the investigated alloys. Thus, it shows the best potential for application in acidic environment of the investigated alloys. Additionally, CoWAlloy2 proved good stability in a supercritical NH3/Na-solution (24 h/550 degrees C/93 MPa).

TI SEM and TEM investigations on a Cr-Ni-Co superalloy
SO HIGH TEMPERATURE MATERIALS AND PROCESSES
AB Chromium (Cr)- nickel (Ni) - cobalt (Co)-based superalloys are used in structural parts of steel annealing furnaces. This application requires the alloy to be modified by silicon (Si) to enhance the service life. This investigation firstly attempts to identify the microstructural changes that occur following silicon modification of the Cr-Ni-Co superalloy in as cast and heat treated conditions and then goes on to study the structure-high temperature properties correlations.

CY FEB 16-20, 2014
CL San Diego, CA
AB The role of Ti on a new Co-based gamma/gamma' two phase superalloy was investigated. Scanning Electron Microscopy(SEM), X-ray Diffraction(XRD) were employed to study the microstructure of alloys with various Ti contents. The volume of gamma' rise steadily with the increase of Ti content, and the morphology switched from fine rod-like to regular cubical when the Ti concentration is over 6%. The addition of Ti reduced the misfit between gamma/gamma' phase, the misfit of the alloy with 8% Ti was only 0.15%. The room temperature hardness was improved with the increase of Ti content, which peaked when the Ti content is 8%, then dropped. The results indicated that Ti is an key element in the alloying development of Co-Al-W based superalloys.

TI Thermal expansion behavior of new Co-based alloys and implications for
   coatings
SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB The thermal expansion behavior of five gamma'-(L1(2)) containing Co-based superalloys was measured using push-rod dilatometry. These results were analyzed to determine the mean coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), the instantaneous CTE, and gamma'-solvus temperature of the alloys. The CTE was found to depend strongly on the gamma'-solvus temperature.
   In turbine applications, these alloys will be part of a multilayer system that generates thermal stresses due to the CTE mismatch between the components. To investigate this phenomenon, the CTE data was incorporated into a thermo-mechanical model to calculate the energy release rate (ERR) for the delamination of coatings from these alloys. The ERR of a thermally grown oxide (TGO) formed on the bare and bond coated Co-based alloys was determined as a function of superalloy and bond coat CTE. The ERR of a thermal barrier coating (TBC) was evaluated as a function of temperature, superalloy LIE, and coating thickness. The ERR was found to be about 1.5 x greater in Co-based superalloys compared to Ni-based superalloys cooled from T = 1100 degrees C to ambient. Strategies for reducing the driving force for delamination are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI The effect of nickel and silicon addition on some oxidation properties
   of novel Co-based, high temperature alloys
SO CORROSION SCIENCE
AB Isothermal oxidation was carried out on gamma'-strengthened Co-Al-W-B-Ni and Co-Al-W-B-Si superalloys at 800, 900, and 1000 degrees C. Ni-addition to Co-Al-W-B alloys leads to an absence of B within the inner oxide layer and at the grain boundaries, as indicated by ToF-SIMS. As a result, also inner Al2O3-formation is inhibited, which leads to inferior oxidation properties compared to Ni-free alloys. In contrast, Si-addition enhances formation of protective Al2O3 at 900 and 1000 degrees C due to enhanced selective Al-oxidation. Si-containing phases at the oxide/alloy interface, at the grain boundaries, and within precipitates are of subordinate importance but may further improve oxidation resistance. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Investigation on the intermetallic compound Co3Ta and high-temperature
   phase equilibria in the Co-Ni-Ta system
SO INTERMETALLICS
AB The crystal structure of Co3Ta was identified to be of the BaPb3 type having hexagonal R (3) over barm symmetry and Pearson symbol hR36 on the basis of X-ray diffraction data. The solidification process of the as-cast Co-Ni-Ta alloys and phase equilibria at 1473 K of the annealed Co-Ni-Ta alloys were studied by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and differential thermal analysis (DTA) techniques. The liquidus surface projection and isothermal section at 1473 K of the Co-Ni-Ta system were first established. The liquidus surface projection consisted of 11 primary solidification regions and 9 ternary invariant reactions, and the isothermal section at 1473 K was made up of 8 three-phase regions and 17 two-phase regions. The addition of nickel can stabilize Co3Ta such that the peritectic temperature is at least 1594 K in the Co-Ni-Ta system, which is higher than the peritectoid one at 1306 K in the Co-Ta system. The present experimental results could be used as guidance to cobalt-based superalloys and offer potential candidates for cobalt/nickel intermetallic compounds.

TI Effect of Cr addition on gamma-gamma ' cobalt-based Co-Mo-Al-Ta class of
   superalloys: a combined experimental and computational study
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB The present article deals with effect of Cr addition (10 at.%) on the partitioning behavior and the consequent effect on mechanical properties for tungsten-free gamma-gamma' cobalt-based superalloys with base alloy compositions of Co-30Ni-10Al5Mo- 2Ta (2Ta) and Co-30Ni-10Al-5Mo-2Ta-2Ti (2Ta2Ti). Cr addition leads to a change in the morphology of the strengthening cuboidal-shaped gamma' precipitates to a spherical shape. The site preference of Cr atoms in two alloy systems (with and without Ti) has been experimentally investigated using atom probe tomography with the supportive prediction from first principles DFT-based computations. Cr partitions more to the c matrix relative to gamma'. However, Cr also has a strong effect on the Ta and Mo partitioning coefficient across gamma/gamma' interfaces. The value of partition coefficient for Mo (K-Mo) becomes <1 with Cr addition to the alloys. Results from ab initio calculations show that the Cr atoms prefer to replace Mo atoms in the sublattice sites of the Ll(2) unit cell. The solvus temperature of about 1038 and 1078 degrees C was measured for 10Cr2Ta and 10Cr2Ta 2Ti alloy, respectively, and these Cr-containing alloys have very low densities in the range of similar to 8.4-8.5 gm/cm(-3). The 0.2% compressive proof strength of 10Cr2Ta2Ti alloy yields a value of 720 MPa at 870 degrees C, substantially better than most Co-Al-W-based alloys and many of the nickel-based superalloys (e.g., MAR-M-247).

TI Energetics of antiphase boundaries in gamma ' Co3(Al,W)-based
   superalloys
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB Although Co-based superalloys are considered as a promising next-generation high-temperature turbine blade material, there are issues with regard to mechanical properties that must be addressed. L1(2) planar defects such as antiphase boundaries (APBs) play a critical role in the high-temperature strength of gamma/gamma ' superalloys, particularly with the magnitude and temperature-range of the yield strength anomaly. APBs in L1(2) Co-3(Al,W) gamma ' are particularly complex due to the presence of the metal mixing on the Al/W sublattice, which introduces additional degrees of freedom to APB behavior, such as Al/W composition and configuration local to the APB. We explore the behavior of APBs in L1(2) Co-3(Al,W) with density functional theory. We find a strong dependence of the APB energy on the composition, particularly from the presence of Al-Al bonds across the 010 APB and W-W bonds across the 111 APB. For both APBs, our calculations also suggest an energetically favorable segregation of Al to the APB. Therefore, future Co alloy design criteria can include alloying elements with preferential segregation to the APB over that of Al to tune the APB energy (and the behavior of the yield strength anomaly). Furthermore, the unique behavior of Al-Al and W-W bonds in the 010 and 111 APB's, respectively, indicate the possibility of preferentially modifying one APB over another with alloying.

AB The effect of Co on the as-cast and heat-treated microstructures was investigated in two experimental Ni-based single-crystal superalloys containing low levels of Re and Ru. The experimental results indicated that increasing the Co content from 7.9 to 15.8 wt pct decreased the volume fraction of (gamma + gamma') eutectic and the solidification segregation ratio of W. High levels of Co additions were also found to decrease the solvus temperatures of the gamma' phase and (gamma + gamma') eutectic as well as the solidus temperature. During the long-term thermal exposure at 1373 K (1100 A degrees C), no TCP phases precipitated in either alloy. However, the coarsening and coalescence of gamma' precipitates in the alloy containing 15.8 wt pct Co was slower than that in the other alloy with 7.9 wt pct Co. In the current study, high levels of Co additions decreased the equilibrium volume fraction of gamma' phase, leading to a change in the partitioning ratios of TCP-forming elements Cr, Mo, Re, and W between the gamma and gamma' phases. This change resulted in a lower degree of elemental supersaturation in the gamma matrix and improved the phase stability of the gamma/gamma' microstructure. These experimental results were then compared with those obtained from multi-component thermodynamic calculations, and good agreement was observed.

TI Effect of Al, Ti and Cr additions on the gamma-gamma' microstructure of
   W-free Co-Ta-V-Based superalloys
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB The recently-discovered metastable gamma'-Co-3(Ta0.76V0.24) phase formed on aging in a Co-6Ta-6V (at.%) ternary alloy is stabilized by partial replacement of Ta and V with Al and Ti. In two alloys with composition Co-6Al-3Ta-3V and Co-5Al-3Ta-3V-1Ti with gamma+gamma' microstructure, the gamma'-precipitates remain stable for up to 168 h at 850 and 900 C, with no precipitation of additional phases. Adding Ni and B and doubling the Ti concentration produces a gamma/gamma' superalloy, Co-10Ni-5Al-3Ta-3V-2Ti-0.04B (at.%), with gamma' precipitates which are stable up to six weeks of aging at 850 degrees C, while slowly coarsening and coalescing from cuboidal to elongated shapes. After one day of aging at 850 degrees C, the gamma' nanoprecipitates have a (Co0.83Ni0.17)(3)(Ta0.42Al0.23Ti0.19V0.15B0.01) composition, with Al and Ti replacing at the same rate both Ta and V in the original metastable Co-3(Ta0.76V0.24) phase. To improve oxidation resistance, 4% Cr is added to the new superalloy, resulting in a somewhat higher volume fraction of finer cuboidal gamma' precipitates after one week of aging at 850 degrees C, but no other deleterious phases. These W-and Mo-free gamma/gamma' superalloys show good creep resistance at 850 degrees C, on par with two other recent Co-base gamma/gamma' superalloys: (i) Co-9W-9Al-8Cr (at.%) which has higher density due to its high W content, and (ii) Co-30Ni-10Al-5Mo-2Nb (at.%) which has lower density (as it is W-free) but contains triple the Ni concentration.

TI A new class of high strength high temperature Cobalt based gamma-gamma '

SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB The present paper reports a new class of Co based superalloys that has gamma-gamma' microstructure and exhibits much lower density compared to other commercially available Co superalloys including Co-Al-W based alloys. The basic composition is Co-10Al-5Mo (at%) with addition of 2 at% Ta for stabilization of gamma' phase. The gamma-gamma' microstructure evolves through solutionising and aging treatment. Using first principles calculations, we observe that Ta plays a crucial role in stabilizing gamma' phase. By addition of Ta in the basic stoichiometric composition Co-3(Al, Mo), the enthalpy of formation (Delta H-f) of L1(2) structure (gamma' phase) becomes more negative in comparison to DO19 structure. The All of the L12 structure becomes further more negative by the occupancy of Ni and Ti atoms in the lattice suggesting an increase in the stability of the gamma' precipitates. Among large number of alloys studied experimentally, the paper presents results of detailed investigations on Co-10Al-5Mo-2Ta, Co-30Ni-10Al-5Mo-2Ta and Co-30Ni-10Al-5Mo-2Ta-2Ti. To evaluate the role alloying elements, atom probe tomography investigations were carried out to obtain partition coefficients for the constituent elements. The results show strong partitioning of Ni, Al, Ta and Ti in ordered gamma' precipitates. 2015 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A high stability of the high-temperature. phase is found. It forms upon solidification according to the reaction L reversible arrow beta + gamma and is nonequilibrium at 1200 and 1300 degrees C (below the temperatures of the transformations beta + gamma reversible arrow beta + gamma + gamma' reversible arrow beta + gamma'). The volume fraction of the gamma-Ni phase increases with the cobalt content or upon chromium addition in comparison with its fraction in the base alloy. The influence of alloying on the cobalt and chromium distribution in alloy phases is estimated. Additional alloying increases the differences in the phase compositions in cobalt and chromium.

TI Coarsening kinetics of gamma ' precipitates in cobalt-base alloys
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB The expeditious development of novel cobalt-base gamma-gamma' alloys as possible next generation superalloys critically depends on achieving a comprehensive understanding of the coarsening kinetics of ordered gamma' precipitates. This paper discusses the coarsening of Ll(2) ordered Co-3(W, Al) precipitates in a model ternary Co-10Al-10W (at.%) alloy during isothermal annealing at 800 and 900 C. The experimentally determined temporal evolution of average size of the gamma' precipitates suggests classical matrix diffusion limited Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner coarsening at both temperatures. The gamma' coarsening rate constants have been determined using a modified coarsening rate equation for non-dilute solutions. Furthermore, using the Cahn Hilliard formulation for interfacial energy, the gamma/gamma' interfacial energies at the respective annealing temperatures have been correlated to the concentration profile across the interface that has been experimentally determined using atom probe tomography. The calculated interfacial energies are in comparable range with those observed in nickel-base superalloys. Additionally, this analysis has permitted, for the first time, the determination of the gradient energy coefficient for gamma/gamma' interfaces in Co-base alloys, a critical input for phase-field and other simulation models for microstructural evolution.

The stacking fault energies (SFEs) of the Ni(Co, Al) random solid solutions are calculated as a function of the concentrations of Co and Al. The calculated SFEs decrease with increasing concentrations of Co and Al, which is consistent with the experimental results. The embedding energy term in the present potential has an important influence on the SFEs of the random solid solutions. The cross-slip processes of a screw dislocation in homogenous Ni(Co) solid solutions are simulated using the present potential and the nudged elastic band method. The cross-slip activation energies increase with increasing Co concentration, which implies that the creep resistance of gamma(Ni) may be improved by the addition of Co.

AB The carbides reinforcing cast superalloys are the most often chromium carbides or tantalum carbides (TaC), the second ones being preferred for very high temperature. In this work, three chromium-rich alloys based on Fe, Ni and Co, containing either TaC carbides in unusually high quantity, or unusual HfC carbides were cast and subjected to 3-points bending tests at 1200 degrees C under constant load in order to specify and compare their creep behavior under 20 MPa. The best alloy in this field appeared to be the cobalt-based one reinforced with interdendritic eutectic HfC carbides. After comparison with a Co-25Cr-0.5C-7.5Ta alloy, known for its high strength at 1200 degrees C, this alloy confirmed its great interest for uses at elevated temperature under flexural or tensile stress.

TI A Novel Type of Environmentally Friendly Slurry Coatings
SO JOM
AB A variety of commercial slurries are available to aluminize the surfaces of nickel-based superalloys; however, they have three main disadvantages. First, the phosphates and chromates or halides used as binders or to activate the diffusion species are environmentally harmful and toxic; second, the slurry coatings can only produce high-aluminum-activity coatings which form precipitate-rich coatings that are detrimental to adherence. Finally, these coatings are limited to the incorporation of aluminum and silicon, whereas the co-deposition of other elements such as chromium or cobalt has not been achieved so far. In this work, the limitations of slurry coatings have been overcome by carefully designing the powder composition and controlling the process to produce co-deposition coatings with chromium, cobalt, or nickel by using nontoxic water-based slurries. This also opens an effective way to control Al activity and to produce low-activity aluminized coatings for the first time when using the slurry technique. These results expand the application range of slurry coatings so they can also be applied under ambient atmosphere, making it possible to fully coat aero engine pieces or large-scale industrial components, providing all properties that are usually only achieved by using more complex and expensive methods such as chemical vapor deposition. Furthermore, these new coatings offer unique advantages that can be very favorable especially as a repairing technique.

TI Thermodynamic and experimental study of 30 wt-%Cr-containing {Co, Fe or
   Ni}-based alloys with very high contents in Ta and C
SO CANADIAN METALLURGICAL QUARTERLY
AB TaC carbides are among the most efficient particles for reinforcing cast refractory alloys and superalloys against mechanical stresses at temperature as high as 1000 degrees C and over. The most common TaC-strengthened superalloys contain less than 0.5 wt-%C and 5 wt-%Ta. Enriching alloys in C and Ta may lead to higher fractions in TaC and therefore possibly to higher mechanical properties for service in hot conditions. The present work explores the microstructures achievable in a cobalt alloy, a nickel one and an iron one, by the introduction of 1 wt-%C and 15 wt-%Ta, first using thermodynamic calculations and second by real elaboration. High fractions in TaC were effectively obtained, script-like eutectic ones, but also blocky preeutectic ones less efficient for reinforcement. These blocky TaC, the formation of which was explained by thermodynamic calculations, tend to aggregate together in some locations, with an overconsumption of Ta. However, some disagreements were noticed between predictions with thermodynamic calculations and as-cast microstructures.

TI As-cast microstructures and behavior at high temperature of
   chromium-rich cobalt-based alloys containing hafnium carbides
SO MATERIALS CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
AB Hafnium is often used to improve the high temperature oxidation resistance of superalloys but not to form carbides for strengthen them against creep. In this work hafnium was added in cobalt-based alloys for verifying that HfC can be obtained in cobalt-based alloys and for characterizing their behavior at a very temperature. Three Co-25Cr-0.25 and 0.50C alloys containing 3.7 and 7.4 Hf to promote HfC carbides, and four Co-25Cr-0 to 1C alloys for comparison (all contents in wt.%), were cast and exposed at 1200 degrees C for 50 h in synthetic air. The HfC carbides formed instead chromium carbides during solidification, in eutectic with matrix and as dispersed compact particles. During the stage at 1200 degrees C the HfC carbides did not significantly evolve, even near the oxidation front despite oxidation early become very fast and generalized. At the same time the chromium carbides present in the Co-Cr-C alloys totally disappeared in the same conditions. Such HfC-alloys potentially bring efficient and sustainable mechanical strengthening at high temperature, but their hot oxidation resistance must be significantly improved. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

SO CORROSION SCIENCE
AB Isothermal oxidation in air was carried out on a gamma'-strengthened single crystalline Co-Al-W-B superalloy at 800, 900, and 1000 degrees C. The absence of grain boundaries leads to inferior oxidation properties at 800 and 900 degrees C, and improved properties at 1000 degrees C, compared to a polycrystalline alloy of the same composition. At lower temperatures, grain boundary diffusion is dominant and assumed to be the reason for enhanced B-accumulation in the inner oxide layer and enhanced formation of the protective inner Al2O3 layer. However, at 1000 degrees C superior oxidation resistance of the single crystalline superalloy can be observed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Compressive strain hold effect on high temperature low-cycle fatigue
   crack growth in superalloys
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL
AB Crack growth mechanisms taking into account the oxidation and mean stress effect in nickel- and cobalt-based superalloys were determined by crack growth tests using a strain waveform including compressive strain hold. Cracks were found to propagate on the dendrite boundary in both superalloys. Crack growth rates were increased by increasing the compressive hold time. Oxidation around the crack tip was detected by electron probe micro analysis (EPMA) and was found to accelerate the fatigue crack growth. The oxidation component in the normalized crack growth rate by oxidation is proportional to about the 1/3 power of loading frequency for Ni-based superalloy, whereas the power for Co-based superalloy is about 1/2. Furthermore, mean stresses in the nickel-based superalloy, which has a high proof strength even at high temperature, were increased by the compressive strain hold. It was also found that increasing the mean stress accelerates the crack growth. A crack growth model that considers effects of both oxidation at crack the tip and mean stress was discussed from these test results.

The alloys contain a initial two phase microstructure consisting of ordered (L1(2)) precipitates embedded in a solid-solution FCC matrix, similar to Ni-base alloys. Tension creep tests of single crystal Co-base alloys have been conducted in vacuum at 900 degrees C at stresses between 275 and 379 MPa. Minimum creep rates of these Co-Al-W-base alloys are comparable to commercial Ni-base superalloy Rene N4. Directional coarsening and the formation of W-rich phases are observed during creep. Implications for future design of the Co-base alloys are discussed.

TI Thermal Analysis in the Technological "Step" Test of H282 Nickel Alloy
SO ARCHIVES OF FOUNDRY ENGINEERING
AB Superalloys show a good combination of mechanical strength and resistance to surface degradation under the influence of chemically active environments at high temperature. They are characterized by very high heat and creep resistance. Their main application is in gas turbines, chemical industry, and in all those cases where resistance to creep and the aggressive corrosion environment is required. Modern jet engines could never come into use if not for progress in the development of superalloys. Superalloys are based on iron, nickel and cobalt. The most common and the most interesting group includes superalloys based on nickel. They carry loads at temperatures well in excess of the eighty percent of the melting point. This group includes the H282 alloy, whose nominal chemical composition is as follows (wt%): Ni - base, Fe - max. 1.5%, Al - 1.5% Ti - 2.1%, C - 0.06% Co - 10% Cr - 20% Mo - 8.5%. This study shows the results of thermal analysis of the H282 alloy performed on a cast step block with different wall thickness. Using the results of measurements, changes in the temperature of H282 alloy during its solidification were determined, and the relationship dT / dt = f (t) was derived. The results of the measurements taken at different points in the cast step block allowed identifying a number of thermal characteristics of the investigated alloy and linking the size of the dendrites formed in a metal matrix (DAS) with the thermal effect of solidification. It was found that the time of solidification prolonged from less than ome minute at 10 mm wall thickness to over seven minutes at the wall thickness of 44 mm doubled the value of DAS.

So far Co-Re system has not been investigated from the point of view of strengthening and oxidation and therefore different possibilities of strengthening mechanisms have been explored for our alloy development. Cr, a common element for oxidation resistance in many systems, is added along with Si in Co-Re alloys to improve oxidation behaviour at high temperatures.

TI On the effect of Re addition on microstructural evolution of a
   CoNi-based superalloy
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB In this study, the effect of rhenium (Re) addition on microstructural evolution of a new low-density Co-Ni-Al-Mo-Nb based superalloy is presented. Addition of Re significantly influences the gamma' precipitate morphology, the gamma/gamma' lattice misfit and the gamma/gamma' microstructural stability during long term aging. An addition of 2 at.% Re to a Co-30Ni-10Al-5Mo-2Nb (all in at.%) alloy, aged at 900 degrees C for 50 h, reduces the gamma/gamma' lattice misfit by similar to 40% (from +0.32% to +0.19%, measured at room temperature) and hence alters the gamma' morphology from cuboidal to round-cornered cuboidal precipitates. The composition profiles across the gamma/gamma' interface by atom probe tomography (APT) reveal Re partitions to the gamma phase (K-Re = 0.34) and also results in the partitioning reversal of Mo to the gamma phase (K-Mo = 0.90) from the gamma' precipitate. An inhomogeneous distribution of Gibbsian interfacial excess for the solute Re (Gamma(Re), ranging from 0.8 to 9.6 atom.nm(-2)) has been observed at the gamma/gamma' interface. A coarsening study at 900 degrees C (up to 1000 h) suggests that the coarsening of gamma' precipitates occurs solely by evaporation-condensation (EC) mechanism. This is contrary to that observed in the Co-30Ni-10Al-5Mo-2Nb alloy as well as in some of the Ni-Al based and high mass density Co-Al-W based superalloys, where gamma' precipitates coarsen by coagulation/coalescence mechanism with an extensive alignment of gamma' along <100> directions as a sign of microstructural instability. The gamma' coarsening rate constant (K-r) and gamma/gamma' interfacial energy are estimated to be 1.13 x 10(-27) m(3)/s and 8.4 mJ/m(2), which are comparable and lower than Co-Al-W based superalloys.

TI Effect of alloying elements for designing of advanced co-free ni-base
   superalloys
SO JOURNAL OF THE JAPAN INSTITUTE OF METALS
AB A second-generation Co-free Ni base single crystal superalloy, TMS-82C (Ni-0Co-4.9Cr-1.0Mo-8.7W-5.3Al-6.0Ta-2.4Re-0.1Hf, in mass%) was derived from its base alloy, TMS-82+ (Ni-7.8Co-4.9Cr-1.9Mo-8.7W-5.3Al-6.0Ta-2.4Re-0.1Hf, in mass%), which had been successfully engine tested. The absent of Co can eliminate the product of isotope Co-60 from radioactive decay, and it can improve the maintainability of the gas turbine engine. However, the removal of Co had decreased the creep strength of TMS-82C. To further improve its creep strength, five additional alloys were designed with the addition of 0.5 mass% Mo, W, Ti, Ta and Re to TMS-82C, respectively. Results indicated that creep properties of all five alloys performed better than that of TMS-82C under 900 degrees C/392 MPa and 1000 degrees C/245 MPa conditions. W-bearing alloy exhibits similar creep property comparing to that of TMS-82+ under the 900 degrees C/392 MPa condition.

TI Effect of Mo on microstructural characteristics and coarsening kinetics
   of gamma' precipitates in Co-Al-W-Ta-Ti alloys
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB The solvus temperature, volume fraction, coarsening behavior of gamma' precipitates and the partitioning behavior of alloying elements as well as lattice misfit of gamma/gamma' phases influence the creep behavior of Ni and Co-base superalloys. However, few investigations about the microstructural characteristics and the coarsening behavior of gamma' precipitates were reported in multicomponent novel Co-base superalloys during thermal exposure. Two alloys containing different contents of molybdenum and tungsten have been investigated to explore the effect of molybdenum on gamma' solvus temperature, gamma+gamma' microstructure and gamma' coarsening in Co-Al-W-Ta-Ti-base alloys. The results showed that the gamma' solvus temperature decreases with the addition of Mo. Mo addition reduces the gamma' volume fractions after aging above 1000 degrees C, but results in negligible influence on the gamma' volume fractions aging at 900 degrees C. Meanwhile, gamma' coarsening is controlled by diffusion in experimental alloys after aging at 900 degrees C and 1000 degrees C, and the kinetics of gamma' growth in experimental alloys are consistent with the predictions of LSW theory.

SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS RESEARCH
AB Molten vanadate-induced hot corrosion is the major cause of failure of superalloys which are generally used at higher temperatures (such as in internal combustion engines, gas turbines, high temperature tooling and dies, and petrochemical industries and marines). This effect can be minimized by applying thermally stable coatings over the superalloy. In this aspect, the current work investigates the effect of nanostructured aluminum chromium nitride (AlCrN) and titanium aluminum nitride (TiAlN) coatings on the hot corrosion behavior of Co-based superalloy, Superco-605, in an aggressive environment of Na2SO4-60% V2O5 (ratio by weight) at 700 degrees C up to 80 cycles. Each cycle consisted of 1 h heating at 700 degrees C followed by 20 min cooling in an ambient temperature. Hot corrosion kinetics was studied using the thermogravimetric technique and found to follow the parabolic rate law. The corrosion surface morphology and phases formed during hot corrosion were studied using field emission scanning electron microscopy equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction techniques. It was found that AlCrN coating had a better hot corrosion resistance than TiAlN coating.

TI New observations of a nanoscaled pseudomorphic bcc Co phase in bulk
   Co-Al-(W,Ta) superalloys
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB The influence of composition on microstructural phase stability has been assessed for an emerging class of Co-based superalloys. This has been achieved using a combinatorial approach that incorporates both material synthesis and state-of-the-art characterization techniques. A compositionally graded Co-11Al-xW-yTa alloy (x <= 10, y=10-x, all in wt.%) was produced using Laser Engineered Net Shaping (LENS') and subsequently solutionized and water quenched. At selected locations along the gradient, the microstructures present were characterized in detail, and phase identification was conducted on site-specific thin specimens using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), providing details regarding the earliest stages of microstructural evolution in these alloys. The partitioning behavior of the alloying elements W, Ta and Al was characterized using a 3-D local electrode atom probe, revealing the existence of Co-rich clusters. In addition, high-resolution TEM and precession electron diffraction have revealed and confirmed that these clusters are a pseudomorphic body-centered cubic (bcc) structure that has resulted from the decomposition of a B2 ordered region. Although bcc Co has previously been reported in some thin-film multilayers, owing to the relative stabilities of the bcc phase and the face-centered cubic (fcc) phase, this observation has not been previously reported in bulk structural materials. It is argued that this nanoscaled pseudomorphic bcc Co phase may be a precursor to the fcc phase. (C) 2014 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Different Effect of Co on the Formation of Topologically Close-Packed
   Phases in Ni-Cr-Mo and Ni-Cr-Re Alloys
SO METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND
   MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB In current study, two sets of Ni-based alloys (Ni-Cr-Mo and Ni-Cr-Re series) containing 0 to 15 at. pct of Co addition were investigated to understand the formation behavior of TCP phases. Significant difference on the formation behavior of TCP phases and corresponding Co effect was found in two series alloys. TCP precipitates (P and mu phase) were observed in both grain interiors and boundaries in Ni-Cr-Mo series alloys. Higher levels of Co addition increased the supersaturation of Mo in the gamma matrix, which explained that Co addition promoted mu phase formation. In contrast, the TCP precipitates (sigma phase) formed by the manner of discontinuous precipitation transformation in the grain boundaries in Ni-Cr-Re series alloys. More Co additions suppressed the formation of sigma phase, which was mainly attributed to the decreased supersaturation of Re in thermodynamically metastable gamma matrix. The information obtained from simplified alloy systems in this study is helpful for the design of multicomponent Ni-based superalloys.

TI Creep deformation-induced antiphase boundaries in L1(2)-containing
   single-crystal cobalt-base superalloys
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB Creep-induced antiphase boundaries (APBs) in new Co-base single-crystal superalloys with coherent embedded L1(2)-gamma' precipitates have been observed. APBs formed during single-crystal tensile creep tests performed at 900 degrees C under vacuum at stresses between 275 and 310 MPa. The alloys investigated contained 30-39 at.% Ni, which was added to the Co-Al-W ternary system to expand the gamma-gamma' phase field and increase the gamma'-solvus. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) using two-beam conditions with fundamental and superlattice reflections was performed for defect characterization. The Burgers vector b of dislocations associated with the APBs was determined to be of type b = a(0)/2[011] and a(0)/2[01 (1) over bar]. The displacement vectors, R, of the APBs matched the dislocation Burgers vectors, with R = b = a(0)/2[011]. APBs were observed in nearly every precipitate beyond 0.5% creep strain for the compositions investigated. The implications for high-temperature properties are discussed.

TI Mechanical Properties of Cast & Wrought Pancakes Using New Ni-Co Base
   Disk Superalloys
SO JOURNAL OF THE JAPAN INSTITUTE OF METALS
AB New kinds of cast and wrought (C & W) Ni-Co base superalloys (TMW alloys) have been developed based on the innovative concept of combining two kinds of gamma-gamma' two phase alloys, Ni-base and Co-base alloys, for the applications of turbine disks and high pressure compressor blades. The results based on testing 20 kg ingots indicate that TMW alloys show excellent high temperature strength and formability, may provide 50 degrees C temperature advantage in 630 MPa/100 h creep performance over C & W alloy U720Li.
   In this paper, we report our new results on the full scale pancakes manufactured through the C & W process for real components. The results indicate that TMW alloys had good process ability in the ingot making and forging into disk pancakes. Pancake disks with fine grain size of about 10 mu m were successfully obtained for TMW alloys. TMW alloys provide 58 degrees C to 76 degrees C temperature advantages in 0.2% creep strain life under the 630 MPa condition, over alloy U720Li.

TI Experimental Determination and Thermodynamic Assessment of Phase
   Equilibria in the Co-Mo System
SO MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS
AB Phase equilibria of the solid phases including the magnetic and martensitic transformation temperatures in the Co-Mo system were investigated using two-phase alloys, the diffusion couple technique, differential scanning calorimetry, and vibrating sample magnetometry. Furthermore, ab initio calculations of D0(19)-Co3Mo and several fcc-base ordered structures, including metastable compounds, were carried out to estimate the formation energy. Based on these results, a thermodynamic assessment using the CALPHAD method was performed. A four-sublattice model was used for the fcc-base phase to describe the order-disorder phase transformation. For the mu phase, both a three and a four-sublattice model were applied. The set of thermodynamic values describing the Gibbs energy of the Co-Mo system reproduces the experimental phase diagram well. The four-sublattice model for the mu phase reproduces the site fractions as well as the phase boundaries better than the three-sublattice model. The calculated metastable fcc-base phase diagram considering chemical and magnetic ordering is also reasonable. This is important for estimating the phase stability of the L1(2) phase in Co-base gamma/gamma' superalloys. [doi:10.2320/matertrans.M2012149]

AB The thermal stability and high-temperature strength of single crystal CoNi-base superalloys, Co-30Ni-10Al-7W (at%) and Co-30Ni-10Al-7W-2Ta-3Ti (at%), containing gamma'(L1(2)) phase have been investigated. The investigated CoNi-base superalloy with alloying additions of Ti and Ta exhibits excellent gamma' solves temperature, 1236 degrees C, and high-temperature strength, 622 MPa at 900 degrees C, compared to reported gamma'-strengthening Co-base superalloys. Detailed analyses of the deformation mechanisms for the investigated alloys were carried out by using the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterization. Two different transitions of deformation mechanisms for the gamma' phase, from superpartial dislocation shearing to dislocation bypassing and to stacking fault shear, occurred in the investigated alloys as the deformation temperature increased above the peak temperatures. Meanwhile, the high-temperature strength of the investigated alloys largely decreased as the transitions of deformation mechanism took place. The influence of alloying effects on energies of faults and the relationship between high-temperature strength and deformation mechanisms were discussed.

SO JOM
AB New, cobalt-based alloys Containing ordered L1(2) precipitates have been investigated. With additions of Cr, Mo, Ni, Re, Ta, and V to the ternary Co-Al-W system, two phase gamma-gamma' microstructures have been established. Solidus and liquidus temperatures are 100 degrees C-150 degrees C higher than advanced nickel-based single-crystal alloys strengthened with the L1(2) phase. An anomalous rise in flow stress with temperature is observed. Single crystals have been solidified and partitioning during solidification is limited in the ternary; system, suggesting a high resistance to convective instabilities. Oxidation at 900 degrees C results in the formation of cobalt oxide. Following oxidation, an inner layer of Al2O3 is observed in uncoated Cr-containing alloys and Cr2O3 is observed in alloys subjected to chromization.

SO DOKLADY CHEMISTRY
AB The structures and phase compositions of a series of Co-9 at % Al-x at % W alloys (where x = 4.6, 6.8, 8.5, 10.0, 12.6) have been studied. All of them are dominated by the structure gamma + gamma', with the content of other phases (the mu phase and the phase D0(19) based on Co3W) being insignificant. With increasing tungsten content of the alloy (to 10 at % W), the volume fraction of the gamma' phase increases, and so does its degree of long-range order. The alloy that is optimal in structure and mechanical properties has the composition Co-8.2 at % Al-8.5 at % W. The dissolution range of the gamma' phase was determined as 920-1054A degrees C. Young's moduli of cobalt alloys exceed E of commercial nickel-based superalloys. The samples of the studied alloys are in the ferromagnetic state with a Curie temperature of 870A degrees C. With increasing tungsten content of the alloy, its saturation magnetization decreases and the coercive force increases. The coercive force is minimal in an as-cast sample and increases as it is subjected to deformation or heat treatment.

TI Elemental partitioning and mechanical properties of Ti- and
   Ta-containing Co-Al-W-base superalloys studied by atom probe tomography
   and nanoindentation
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB Elemental partitioning and hardness in Ti- and Ta-containing Co-base superalloys, strengthened by gamma'-Co-3(Al, W) precipitates, have been studied by local measurements. Using atom probe tomography, we detect strong partitioning of W (partitioning coefficients from 2.4 to 3.4) and only slight partitioning of Al (partitioning coefficients <= 1.1) to the gamma'-Co-3(Al, W) phase. Al segregates to the gamma/gamma' phase boundaries, whereas W is depleted at the gamma side of the boundaries after aging at 900 degrees C and slow air cooling. This kind of Al segregation and W depletion is much less pronounced when water quenching is applied. As a result, these effects are considered to be absent at high temperatures and therefore should not influence the creep properties. Ti and Ta additions are found to strongly partition to the gamma' phase and greatly increase the gamma' volume fraction. Our results indicate that the alloying elements Al, W, Ti and Ta all occupy the B sublattice of the A(3)B structure (L1(2) type) and affect the partitioning behavior of each other. Nanoindentation measurements show that Ta also increases the hardness of the gamma' phase, while the hardness of the gamma channels remains nearly constant in all alloys. The change in hardness of the gamma' phase can be ascribed to the substitution of Al and W atoms by Ti and/or Ta. (C) 2014 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Effect of heat treatment conditions on microstructures of new Ni-Co
   based superalloys for turbine disks
SO JOURNAL OF THE JAPAN INSTITUTE OF METALS
AB New Ni-Co based superalloys (TMW alloys) for gas turbine disks have been recently developed. These new alloys are designed to have higher temperature capability than that of U720Li disk alloy by 50 degrees C. The concept behind alloy design is to combine two kinds of gamma-gamma' structure alloys, U720Li (Ni-Ni3Al) and Co-Ti (CO-CO3Ti) alloys. In this article, we describe the effect of solution heat-treatment conditions on the microstructures of TMW disk alloys (TMW1, 2, 4, and 2 + 4Co), such as the grain size and volume fraction of the primary gamma' phases and the hardness. Microstructural observation results showed that the average grain size and volume fraction of the primary gamma' phases are strongly influenced by the solution temperatures. For each TMW alloy, we identified the relationship among the solution temperature, volume fraction of the primary gamma' phases, and grain size that is necessary to achieve optimum properties. Vickers hardness testing results showed that the addition of a Co-Ti alloy has a positive effect on alloy strengthening at room and elevated temperatures. These results can help determine the optimum heat-treatment condition.

TI Looking for New Polycrystalline MC-Reinforced Cobalt-Based Superalloys
   Candidate to Applications at 1200 degrees C
SO ADVANCES IN MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
AB For applications for which temperatures higher than 1150 degrees C can be encountered the currently best superalloys, the gamma/gamma' single crystals, cannot be used under stress because of the disappearance of their reinforcing gamma' precipitates at such temperatures which are higher than their solvus. Cobalt-based alloys strengthened by refractory and highly stable carbides may represent an alternative solution. In this work the interest was focused on MC carbides of several types. Alloys were elaborated with atomically equivalent quantities in M element (among Ti, Ta, Nb, Hf, or Zr) and in C. Script-like eutectic TiC, TaC, NbC, HfC, and ZrC carbides were successfully obtained in the interdendritic spaces. Unfortunately, only one type, HfC, demonstrated high morphological stability during about 50 hours at 1200 degrees C. The concerned alloy, of the Co-25Cr-0.5C-7.4Hf type (in wt.%), was further characterized in flexural creep resistance and air-oxidation resistance at the same temperature. The creep behaviour was very good, notably by comparison with amore classical Co-25Cr-0.5C-7.5Ta alloy, proving that the interest of HfC is higher than the TaC one. In contrast the oxidation by air was faster and its behaviour not really chromia-forming. Significant improvements of this chemical resistance are expected before taking benefit from the mechanical superiority of this alloy.

AB The effect of composition on recrystallisation of single crystal Ni-based superalloys was studied in a series of alloys that vary systematically in composition. Following room temperature macro-indentation and subsequent annealing, alloys containing higher Co concentration showed greater susceptibility to recrystallisation, and this has been attributed to the effect on the gamma' solvus temperature and the stacking fault energy of the gamma phase. Mo, W and Ru did not appear to influence the recrystallisation behaviour systematically, although high concentration of all these elements led to the highest recrystallisation. Moreover, with grain orientation mapping, it was found that the nucleating recrystallisation grains form in orientations similar to the deformed regions, and subsequently twin to form higher angle boundaries and proliferate further within the deformed microstructure. The effects of the interaction between grain boundaries and secondary phases, such as the gamma' and topologically close packed phases, were also studied.

AB Superalloys Nimonic 80A is a wrought nickel base alloy (min. 65 % Ni) and chromium (20 %), with minor additions of carbon, cobalt and iron, as well as major alloying elements of aluminum (1 to 1,8%) and titanium (1,8 to 2,7 %). Chemical composition of the alloy Nimonic 80A has a dominant influence on its mechanical and technological properties. Increasing of the temperature also has a large influence on the mechanical properties of superalloy Nimonic 80A
   Investigations which were carried out have included chemical testing and testing of mechanical properties of superalloy Nimonic 80A at room and higher temperatures. Regression analysis was done on the base of chemical analyses and results of mechanical properties. The results of regression analysis are equations by which on the basis of known chemical composition, ie content of main alloying elements Al, Ti and Co, the mechanical properties of materials at room and higher temperatures can be predicted.

SO MATERIALS AND CORROSION-WERKSTOFFE UND KORROSION
AB A series of six alloys from Ni-25Cr-0.4C-6Ta to Co-25Cr-0.4C-6Ta with a progressive addition of Co in substitution to Ni were elaborated. They were tested for 24h at 1237 degrees C in laboratory air. The corrosion products formed around the samples and the deterioration of the subsurface were analyzed to characterize the high temperature oxidation behavior of these alloys. Three of the studied alloys, the nickel-richest ones, well behaved until 24h at this temperature. Their external oxide scales were essentially composed of chromia. In contrast, locally, the three cobalt-richest alloys were starting to oxidize catastrophically. The significant worsening of the oxidation behavior from the 27wt% Co-containing alloy to the 41wt% Co-containing one suggests that a critical Co content exists between these two values.

   first principles kinetic Monte Carlo
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB The interdiffusivity of Al and the transition metal solutes Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Nb, Mo, Ru, Ta, W, and Re in fcc Co is characterized at 1373 K, 1473 K and 1573 K by binary diffusion couples. The experimental results are complemented by first-principles calculations in combination with kinetic Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the diffusion of Re, W, Mo and Ta in fcc Co. The interdiffusion coefficients of alloying elements in fcc Co are generally smaller than in fcc Ni, but the correlation between interdiffusion coefficients and the atomic number of metal solutes is comparable in Co and Ni. With increasing atomic number and decreasing atomic radii the interdiffusion coefficients of the investigated elements, except for Mn and Fe, decrease strongly. The trends in the diffusivity determined by experiment and simulation are in excellent agreement. Re is the slowest diffusing element in fcc Co among the investigated elements. The electronic structure calculations indicate that this is caused by strong directional bonds between Re and neigh-boring Co atoms. The overall lower diffusivity of solute atoms in Co as compared to Ni suggests that diffusion controlled processes could be slower in Co-base superalloys. (C) 2016 Acta Materialia Inc.

TI Nickel-Based Single-Crystal Superalloys (Ni, Co)-Al-(Ta, Ti)-(Cr, Mo, W)
   Designed by Cluster-Plus-Glue-Atom Model and Their 1000 h Long-Term
   Ageing Behavior at 900 degrees C
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB It has been pointed out recently that the compositions of industrial alloys are originated from cluster-plus-glue-atom structure units in solid solutions. Specifically for nickel-based superalloys, after properly grouping the alloying elements into Al, Ni-like ((Ni) over bar, including Ni, Co, Fe, Re, Ru and Ir), gamma '- forming Cr-like ((Cr) over bar (gamma '), including Ta, Ti, V, Nb), and gamma-forming Cr-like ((Cr) over bar;(gamma), including Cr, Mo and W), the optimal formula for single-crystal superalloys has been established [Al-(Ni) over bar (12)] (Al-1(Cr) over bar (gamma ')(0.5)(Cr) over bar (gamma)(1.5)). In this work, the first generation single-crystal superalloys were investigated on the basis of the proposed formula, by using (Ni) over bar=(Ni and Co), (Cr) over bar (gamma ')=(Ta and Ti), and (Cr) over bar (gamma)=(Cr, Mo and W). Two series of alloys were designed, formulated respectively as group A: [Al-Ni11Co1] (Al1TaxTi0.5-xCr1W0.25Mo0.25), with x=0, 0.25 and 0.5 (the corresponding mass fractions of Ta and Ti are respectively 0Ta-2.65Ti, 4.82Ta-1.26Ti and 9,32Ta-0Ti), and group B: [Al-Ni12-yCo gamma](Al1Ta0.25Ti0.25Cr1W0.25MO0.25), with y=1.5, 1.75, 2 and 2.5 (the corresponding mass fractions of Co are respectively 9.43Co, 11Co, 12.57Co and 15.71Co). The single-crystal superalloys were prepared using selector technique. And then they underwent the following tests of incipient melting, standard heat treatment and 1000 h long term ageing at 900 degrees C. It is found that: (1) In group A, with increasing Ta content (decreasing Ti), all the incipient melting temperatures are increased to above 1330 degrees C, and to the highest value is between 1335 degrees C and 1340 degrees C for alloy 9.32Ta-0Ti; the gamma(')gamma(') lattice negative misfits after standard heat treatment are reduced from -0.262% (0Ta-2.65Ti) to -0.247% (9.32Ta-0Ti); the gamma(') coarsening tendency after long-term ageing is deduced, and alloy 9.32Ta-0Ti has the lowest coarsening rate (K=5.6x10(-5) mu(3)/h). (2) In group B, the Co content does not influence the incipient melting temperature (always above 1330 degrees C) and the coarsening rate of gamma(') after long-term ageing. The major role of Co is to increase the mean size of the gamma(') precipitates to about 0.55 pm and the gamma(') volume fraction to about 69% after the standard heat treatment. These two groups of alloys have their gamma(') coarsening rates approaching the level of third-generation single-crystal superalloys (K approximate to(2.08 similar to 3.82)*10(-5) mu m(3)/h).

TI High-temperature strength and deformation of gamma/gamma ' two-phase
   Co-Al-W-base alloys
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB The high-temperature strength and deformation behavior of gamma/gamma ' two-phase Co-Al-W-base alloys have been studied with polycrystalline and single-crystal materials, The ternary, quaternary and higher-order alloys containing Ta, Cr and/or Re exhibit flow stress anomalies above 873 K due to slip of pairs of 1/2 < 110 > superpartial dislocations on {001} planes, in addition to {111} planes, in the gamma' precipitates. Compression tests on the single-crystal specimens reveal a true anomalous peak temperature of 1073 K for both ternary and Ta-containing quaternary alloys. Above the peak, the ternary alloy exhibits a rapid decrease in strength with temperature, as 1/2 < 110 > dislocations bypass the gamma' precipitates without significant shearing. Conversely, the Ta-containing quaternary alloy sustains strength to higher temperatures due to the activation of 1/3 < 112 > partial dislocation slip that introduces a high density of stacking faults in the gamma' precipitates.

AB The anodic behaviour of surface-oxidised Ni-Fe-Co alloys was investigated over short-term periods of aluminium electrolysis. Additions of 10wt% Co were found to significantly improve the anodic wear resistance, due to suppression of FexO formation. Anodes having cobalt contents >= 30wt% exhibited poor performance due to rapid outwards diffusion of cobalt to the reaction interface. In general, the protective ability of the preformed oxide scales was greatly affected by the level of porosity and surface adhesion. In electrolytes containing <4wt% Al2O3, catastrophic failure of the anodes was observed due to concentration polarisation at the reaction interface. Under these conditions, the metal was rapidly destroyed by a combination of dissolution and fluoridation events.

TI Rapid Assessment of Oxidation Behavior in Co-Based / Alloys
SO OXIDATION OF METALS
AB A high-throughput, non-destructive photostimulated luminescence spectroscopy (PSLS) technique was used to analyze fifty oxidized Co-based / alloy samples for the presence of -Al2O3. Alloys were produced by combinatorial ion-plasma deposition, and oxidation was performed at 1100 degrees C for 1h in air. PSLS measurements are compared with microscopy of oxides in cross-section to relate the presence of the luminescence signal of -Al2O3 with the thickness of the oxide scale. Analysis of the current dataset validates the use of PSLS as a rapid screening technique of oxidation behavior for the present materials system.

TI 77-K TO 1200-K TENSILE PROPERTIES OF SEVERAL WROUGHT SUPERALLOYS AFTER
   LONG-TERM 1093-K HEAT-TREATMENT IN AIR AND VACUUM
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING AND PERFORMANCE
AB The 77 to 1200 K tensile properties of approximately 1.3 mm thick wrought sheet Co-base Haynes alloy 188 and Ni-base Haynes alloy 230 and Inconel 617 have been measured after heat treatment in air and vacuum for periods up to 22,500 h at 1093 K. Significant changes in structure were produced by prior exposures, including precipitation of second phases and, in the case of heat treatment in air, oxide scale and surface-connected grain boundary pits/oxides, as deep as 50 to 70 mum, in all three superalloys. Due to the geometry of the experiment, the vacuum-exposed samples were protected from loss of volatile elements by evaporation; hence, such specimens were simply given 1093 K anneals in an innocuous environment, which produced very little surface attack. Compared to the properties of as-received alloys, prior exposure tended to reduce both the yield strength and ultimate tensile strength, with the greatest reductions at 77 and 298 K. The most dramatic effect of heat treatment was found in the low-temperature residual tensile elongation, where decreases from 40 to 5 % at 77 K were found. Ductility is the only property that was found to have a consistent dependency on environment, with air exposure always yielding less tensile elongation than vacuum exposure.

TI Role of Re and Co on microstructures and gamma ' coarsening in single
   crystal superalloys
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB Seven alloys containing different contents of rhenium and cobalt are investigated to explore systematically the effects of rhenium and cobalt on microstructures and gamma' coarsening. The alloys are exposed to different periods at 950 degrees C and 1050 degrees C. In the alloys containing rhenium, gamma' coarsening is controlled by diffusion. Diffusion coefficient rises with the decreasing of rhenium and the increasing of cobalt. In the alloys containing 4 wt.% Re and Co free, there is TCP phase precipitation when exposed at 1050 degrees C. Additions of 3 wt.% Co to the alloy suppress the formation of TCP phase completely. Co reduces or eliminates the adverse effects of Re. In the Re-free alloys, there is no TCP formation and the coarsening mechanisms are complex. The competition in rate-controlling between diffusion and interface reaction on coarsening kinetics is dependent on the elements and the diffusion behavior. A model describing the process of forming rafts is also established. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB The effects of reducing the W concentration (and concomitantly mass density) of Co-10Ni-6A1-xW-6Ti at% Co-based superalloys, with a gamma(f.c.c.) plus gamma'(L1(2)) microstructure, is investigated for a series of alloys with W concentrations of 6 at% (baseline alloy), 4 and 2 at% (W-reduced) and 0 at% (W-free). The gamma'(L1(2)) solvus temperature decreases strongly (by 46 degrees C per 1 at% reduction in W), while the liquidus and solvus temperatures decrease mildly (3-5 degrees C per 1 at% W reduction) as measured by differential scanning calorimetry. Scanning electron microscopy was used to image phase formation in all alloys. When aging at 900 or 1000 degrees C for 256 h, the W reduction does not result in the appearance of additional phases within the grains beyond the gamma(f.c.c.) and gamma'(L1(2)) phases present in the original alloy. Grain-boundary precipitates are present for all alloy compositions: W-rich or W-free precipitates after aging at 1000 degrees C, and coarsened gamma'(L1(2)) precipitates after aging at 900 degrees C. The composition of grain boundary precipitates were measured with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Vickers microhardness values decrease with decreasing W content, due to a reduction in gamma'(L1(2)) precipitation and 'reduced solid-solution strengthening.

TI Novel Co-Ti-V-base superalloys reinforced by L1(2)-ordered gamma' phase
SO INTERMETALLICS
AB The influences of alloying elements Al and Ni to a Co-Ti-V master alloy on microstructures, phase stabilities and high-temperature mechanical properties have been investigated. A two-phase microstructure gamma/gamma' with ultrahigh gamma' volume fraction was designed in the Co-Ti-V (master alloy), Co-Ti-V-Al (Al-modified) and Co-Ti-V-Ni (Ni-modified) alloys. Al shows a slight tendency to partition into gamma', while Ni exhibits almost equal distribution between the gamma and gamma' phases. Al is found to increase the volume fraction and solvus temperature of gamma'. The solvus temperatures of gamma' in the master alloy, Al-modified and Ni-modified alloys exceed that of Co-9Al-9W alloy (1000 degrees C) by 91, 112 and 82 degrees C, respectively. The flow stresses of the designed alloys exhibit an anomalous positive dependence on temperature rising from 600 to 750 degrees C. The strengths of the master alloy and Ni-modified alloys are not only higher than that of traditional Co-base superalloy MAR-M 302 at the temperature ranging from 700 to 1000 degrees C, but also comparable with that of the commercial Ni-base superalloy IN-939 between 850 and 1000 degrees C. In conclusion, the present Co-Ti-V-base alloys reinforced by gamma' are suggested as potential candidates for high-temperature utilizations.

AB The effect of the nitrogen on the microstructure and properties of a cast Co-based superalloy K640S was investigated with the different level ranged from 24 ppm to 85 ppm. The results indicate that almost all nitrogen exist in the form of nitride precipitation in the vacuum induction melting. It is found that high N level would extend the solidification window during the solidification process, and then increase the quantity of the carbide eutectic phases and led to the distribution in the network form of the eutectics in the interdendritic regions. High nitrogen content (more than 40 ppm) can reduced the mechanical properties of the testing alloy. So, it is suggested that the nitrogen in the recycled Co-based superalloys should be controlled at a suitable level in order to avoid the degradation of their properties.

Ni3Ti-type (eta) phase was observed in the alloys with lower Co and Ti content (alloy20); while a new intermetallic (Ni,Co,Cr)(3)(Ti,Al) phase with a hexagonal structure was detected in the higher Co and Ti containing alloy(alloy50). At temperatures lower than 1023 K, the compressive yield stress increased with increasing Co content up to 28.6 mass% and Ti content up to 7.4 mass%, but decreased with more Co and Ti addition. At temperatures higher than 1273 K, all the alloys showed similar yield stress.

AB Ni-based superalloys are strengthed by refractory elements such as Re, Ru and W [1]. Thus, the information on the interdiffusion coefficient as well as the thermodynamic interaction between the refractory elements is important for the future alloy design. In this study, interdiffusion coefficients of the refractory elements in Ni-X-Y (X, Y=Co, Re, Ru, W) ternary systems were estimated by a series of experiments.
   In the all systems studied in the present works, the main interdiffusion coefficients were much larger than the cross interdiffusion coefficients. In some systems, two cross interdiffuion coefficients had opposite signs each other. For example, in Ni-Co-Ru system, the main interdiffusion coefficients are (D) over tilde (Ru)(CoCo) = 2.7 x 10(-14) and (D) over tilde (Ru)(RuRu) = 6.8 x 10(-15) , while the cross interdiffusion coefficients are (D) over tilde (Ru)(CoRu) = -6.6 x 10(-16) and (D) over tilde (Ru)(RuCo) = 8.9 x 10(-16) at 1523K.
   In Ni-Co-Ru and Ni-Re-Co systems, the activation energies and frequency factors for two main interdiffusion coefficients. For example, Q(Co) = 268(kJ), D-0(Co) = 4.4 x 10(-5) (m(2) s(-1)), D-0(Ru) = 2.9 x 10(-3)(m(2) s(-1)) in Ni-Co-Ru system.

SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES

AB Plastic deformation mechanisms in a crept L1(2) hardened Co-base superalloy are investigated by transmission electron microscopy. The deformation happens mainly in the cobalt solid solution matrix by slip of ordinary a/2 < 101 > {111} dislocations and rafting of the gamma' precipitates perpendicular to the external compressive stress axis is observed. Dislocation structures are early stages of the development of gamma/gamma' interfacial dislocation networks. Furthermore, gamma' precipitates are sheared by partial dislocations generating stacking faults which sometimes extend over matrix channels and neighbouring gamma' precipitates. Due to the positive lattice mismatch at creep temperature the dislocation activity in matrix channels perpendicular to the compressive external stress axis is less pronounced compared to parallel channels.

SO CORROSION SCIENCE
AB The reactivity of metallic alloys with Al has important impacts in industrial components and in Co-based components has been associated with the Al-Co reactions. The reactivity between Al and a CoCrMoSi alloy was assessed by immersion tests in a 55 wt% AlZn bath and DSC tests of multilayered pure Al/CoCr-MoSi specimens. Phases were identified by XRD analysis. Results showed that the synthesis of Al-Co compounds occurs at a temperature as low as 380 degrees C. Despite the higher corrosion resistance of the Laves phase the performance of CoCrMoSi component is compromised by the reactivity between Al and elements from the Co solid solution regions.

All the three coatings show a much lower oxidation rate compared with the bare alloy. Results also indicate the addition of Co to the aluminide coating decreases the oxidation resistance slightly. It can be ascribed to that Co is easier to be oxidized than Ni at high temperature, and the Cr(W) rich phases which could act as a diffusion barrier are less in the coating with higher Co content.

TI Creep properties beyond 1100 degrees C and microstructure of Co-Re-Cr
   alloys
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB The melting point of a novel Co-17Re-23Cr alloy (numbers given in at.%) could be increased by 250 C as compared to established Ni-based superalloys, by optimising the content of Re. Samples were produced by vacuum arc-melting in order to evaluate the creep behaviour at temperatures beyond 1100 degrees C and for microstructural analysis. Three alloys (the Co-17Re-23Cr-based material, and the carbide strengthened alloys Co-17Re-23Cr-2.6C and Co-17Re-23Cr-2.6C-1.2Ta) were investigated. Creep properties, especially the minimum creep rate and the Larson-Miller plots, were compared. The Co-17Re-23Cr-2.6C-1.2Ta alloy has a higher minimum creep rate than Co-17Re-23Cr at 1200 degrees C but it has a lower minimum creep rate than Co-17Re-23Cr at 1100 degrees C. TaC coarsening, detected via transmission electron microscope (TEM) measurements may explain this effect. The overall creep behaviour of Co-17Re-23Cr-2.6C at 1200 degrees C is better than that of Co-17Re-23Cr-2.6C-1.2Ta, but worse than that of Co-17Re-23Cr.
   Microstructural investigations by scanning electron microscopy and TEM reveal a hexagonal closed-packed (hcp) matrix and sigma-phases. The microhardness of the sigma-phase was about 1570 HV (load: 1 g) and around 800 HV for the matrix. Pores and cracks occur along the brittle sigma-phases and grain boundaries in the Co-Re-Cr alloys. A Norton exponent n in between 1.4 and 3.0 points to grain boundary dominated creep mechanisms. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   Perrhenates-Precursors for Superalloy Production
SO METALS
AB Methods for the preparation of selected metal perrhenates and their mixtures are presented in this paper. These materials are suitable for reduction, and therefore for production of alloy powders containing rhenium and other superalloy components, i.e., Cr, Ni and Co. Prepared compounds may be also used as substrates for electrowinning of binary and ternary rhenium alloys. All developed methods are based on an ion exchange technique. This technique allows management of waste solutions, limitation of valuable metals losses, and, importantly, production of high-purity components.

SO SCRIPTA MATERIALIA
AB We report on the sub-nanometer scale characterization of Co-12Ti-4Mo and Co-12Ti-4Cr (at.%) model alloys. Atom probe tomography reveals that Co and Cr partition to gamma, whereas Ti and Mo to gamma'. Additions of Mo and Cr to the reference Co-12Ti system lead to strong increases in gamma' volume fraction by about 25% and 12%, respectively. Element-specific spatial distribution maps along the [001] direction of the L1(2)-ordered gamma' phase reveal that both Mo and Cr preferentially replace Ti on its sublattice. The remaining excess Ti is available for formation of additional gamma', resulting in enhanced gamma' volume fractions. (C) 2018 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

SO JOM
AB This paper reviews our current research activities on developing new multiphase metallic materials for structural applications with a temperature capability beyond 1,200A degrees C. Two promising material systems have been chosen: first, alloys in the system Mo-Si-B which have demonstrated potential due to their high melting point of around 2,000A degrees C and due to the formation of a protecting borosilicate glass layer on the surface at temperatures exceeding 900A degrees C; and second, novel Co-Re-based alloys which have been chosen as a model system for complete miscibility between the elements cobalt and rhenium, offering the possibility of continuous increases of the melting point of the alloy through rhenium additions.

TI Corrosion Behavior of Cobalt-Based Superalloys with Tellurium in Molten
   Salt
SO RARE METAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING
AB The corrosion behavior in high temperature molten salt of cobalt-based alloy powder with different Te contents that was sintered under non-vacuum environment was investigated in a static 800 +/- 5 degrees C and 75% Na2SO4+25% NaCl. The microstructure, corrosion product morphology and phase composition were investigated by OM, SEM and XRD, respectively. The results show that with the increase of Te mass fraction in cobalt-based alloy, the high-temperature molten salt corrosion rate decreases gradually; when the Te content is about 1.6%, a kind of homogeneous and dense Cr2O3 protection oxide film forms on the surface of the alloy substrate and the new phase (CoTeO3, Fe2TeO5) dispersed in the matrix inhibits Co atoms from diffusing to grain boundaries, which retard alloy matrix element dissolution and improve the hot corrosion performance of the alloy. The corrosion rate of cobalt-based alloy decreases from 4.0483 mg/(cm(2).h) of the Te-free alloy to 0.216 mg/(cm(2).h).

TI Electronic states calculation of cobalt by using the DV-X alpha cluster
   method
SO MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS
AB Using the DV-X alpha cluster method, two alloying parameters were calculated in fee Co. One was the bond order (Oo) which is a measure of the covalent bond strength between atoms and the other was the d-orbital energy level (Md) of alloying transition elements. These two alloying parameters were found to change monotonically with the atomic number of alloying 3d transition metals, M. The changes in the Bo with alloying elements could be understood in terms of the difference electron density maps. Also, the Co-M binary phase diagrams could be classified well using Bo-Md map. In addition, local spin moments at the alloying 3d transition metals were obtained. These results will provide us some guide for the design of cobalt-based alloys.

TI Investigation of the mechanisms of Type-II hot corrosion of superalloy

SO CORROSION SCIENCE
AB A microstructural investigation of Type-II hot corrosion was carried out on a single crystal Ni-based superalloy (CMSX-4) pre-coated with Na2SO4 at 700 degrees C in a flowing O-2-SO2-SO3 atmosphere. Corrosion occurred by rapid dissolution of the alloy by molten sulfate eutectics, forming an outer layer rich in Co and Ni and an inner layer rich in Cr and Al. The outer layer transformed into mixed oxides of Co and Ni, with concurrent evolution of the continuous S-rich inner layer. A multicomponent analysis provides insight into diffusional interactions among Co, Ni, and S. Crystal orientation and microstructure effects were also studied. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS RESEARCH
AB The effects of W, Re, Cr, and Mo on microstructural stability, such as the morphology of phase and the topologically close-packed (TCP) phase precipitation are systematically investigated in eleven kinds of Ni-based single crystal superalloys containing certain amounts of Co, Al, and Ta. After heat treatment, all the designed alloys show different sizes of phases with typical cuboidal morphology occupying 75% of the total volume. With increasing Re content, the size of decreases obviously, while the size of decreases slightly with increasing Cr and Mo contents. Increasing W does not affect the size of . As a result of thermal exposure at 1000 degrees C for 1000 h, some acicular, rod-like, and blocky TCP phases are precipitated in most alloys. It is noted that Mo and Re can strongly promote the precipitation of TCP phase, but W has no obvious effect on TCP phase precipitation. In addition, transmission electron microscope analysis indicates that these TCP phases are sigma phase, phase, and R phase.

TI Effects of Nickel Content on Microstructural Evolution and gamma'
   Dissolution of Co-8.8Al-9.8W Base Alloys
SO RARE METAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING
AB To study the effects of nickel contents (5%, 15%, 25% and 35%, atomic fraction) on microstructural evolution and gamma' dissolution behavior of Co-Al-W base alloys, the gamma' phase microstructural evolution, gamma' phase transformation temperatures and microhardness of Co-Al-W base alloys with aging treatment were analyzed using scanning-electron microscope (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) etc. Results show that with the increasing of Ni content, gamma' solvus temperature increases at different degrees and the volume fraction of gamma' phase increases gradually. When the nickel content in Co-8.8Al-9.8W alloy reaches 25%, gamma' phase transformation temperature increases to 1100 C. The solidus temperatures and gamma' phase morphology of the four Co-Al-W base alloys are nearly unchanged. The typical gamma/gamma' two-phase microstructure is generated in the four alloys after the heat treatment at 900 degrees C for 50 h. After aging at 900 degrees C for 100 h, the gamma' phase volume fraction decreases and the gamma' phase is obviously coarsened. The microhardness of the four alloys after heat treatment at 900 degrees C for 50 and 100 h indicates that the microhardness is raised from 5Ni alloy to 15Ni alloy, but is lowered when further increasing the Ni content. With the aging treatment time from 50 h to 100 h, the volume fraction of gamma' phase decreases and y' phase coarsens, which reduces the hardness of Co-8.8Al-9.8W-based alloy.

SO ANNALES DE CHIMIE-SCIENCE DES MATERIAUX
AB The effect of dendrite fineness on the high temperature oxidation behaviour was studied for a cast cobalt alloy Co-8Ni-30Cr-0.4C-6Ta (wt%) elaborated either in a conventional sand mould or in a water-cooled copper crucible. Its oxidation behaviour in air was studied at 1000, 1100 and 1200 degrees C for 100 hours. The parabolic constant Kp and the chromia volatilization constant Kv were determined by analyzing the (Delta m/S)center dot(d(Delta m/S)/dt) versus (-Delta m/S) curves. The Kp and Kv constants were confirmed by the agreement between mathematical and experimental mass gain curves. They are lower than those obtained for a nickel alloy with similar contents of alloying elements, and the same fine microstructure. The oxidation behaviours of the two dendrite finenesses were compared. The mass gain showed that the dendrite fineness influences the oxidation rate. More precisely, it does not really influence the parabolic oxidation but only the chromia volatilization, as revealed by the obtained Kp and Kv values. A coarser microstructure generally leads to a quicker volatilization of chromia.

In addition, a least squares method has been utilized to optimize diffusion mobility parameters using DICTRA simulations to best fit the experimental concentration versus distance curves. Predictions of the diffusion matrix using the refined mobility database are in good agreement with the values obtained at the diffusion path crossing points.

   TaC-containing cast alloys
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB A series of six alloys derived from a Ni-25Cr-0.4C-6Ta (wt.%) base one was developed by substituting nickel by cobalt. They were synthesized by casting and exposed to oxidative environment at two high temperatures. Their bulk microstructures were studied in as-cast condition and in two high temperature aged states. Their surfaces after oxidation during aging were characterized. The cobalt enrichment succeeded in avoiding chromium carbides formation and in stabilizing the TaC carbides at high temperature. As the high temperature morphologic stability of TaC was not perfect, it was much better than the one of the chromium carbides, but can be improved by the total removal of nickel. Unfortunately, at the same time, the oxidation behavior, initially good, shows increased rate of the oxides formation. The room temperature hardness was also significantly increased by the substitution of Ni by Co, and decreased after aging when carbides became rounder or fragmented. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI Identification of a ternary mu-phase in the Co-Ti-W system - An advanced
   correlative thin-film and bulk combinatorial materials investigation
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB The formation of a ternary It-phase is documented for the system Co-Ti-W. The relevant compositional stability range is identified by high-throughput energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, electrical resistance and X-ray diffraction maps from a thin-film materials library (1} mu m thickness). Bulk samples of the identified compositions were fabricated to allow for correlative film and bulk studies. Using analytical scanning and transmission electron microscopy, we demonstrate that in both, thin film and bulk samples, the D85 phase (is-phase) coexists with the 06-phase and the A2-phase at comparable average chemical compositions. Young's moduli and hardness values of the mu-phase and the C36-phase were determined by nanoindentation. The trends of experimentally obtained elastic moduli are consistent with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. DFT analysis also supports the experimental findings, that the it-phase can solve up to 18 at.% Ti. Based on the experimental and DFT results it is shown that CALPHAD modeling can be modified to account for the new findings. (C) 2017 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this study, the hardfacing behavior of Cr-Ni stainless steel was studied by depositing of Stellite 1, Stellite 6, and Stellite 12 superalloys on Cr-Ni stainless steel specimens using electric arc welding and tungsten inert gas welding. The cobalt base alloys were hardfaced on stainless steel plates as a single layer. The samples taken from the hardfaced materials were studied by optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and micro-hardness measurements. The hardness and wear resistance values of the layer obtained after the hardfacing processes are satisfactory and the process seem to be suitable for application.

AB Ni-based superalloys with aluminium belong to systems with order-disorder transition for the gamma and gamma' structures. Because of the complexity of these alloys, quaternary systems can be taken as suitable and sufficiently representative model systems for a theoretical study of their phase equilibria. In recent years several assessments including various model descriptions of ordered phases and ordering based on the CALPHAD formalism have been made with the aim to describe phase diagrams of relevant binary, ternary and some quaternary systems. For our study, the Ni-Al-Cr-Co system was chosen and phase boundaries of gamma and gamma' phase equilibrium were calculated based on the data for lower-order systems. The calculations were performed by means of the software 'Thermo-Calc'. Values obtained were compared with experimentally determined phase information for five alloys with constant Ni content (70 at.%) after long-term annealing at 900degreesC. The experiments were realized by means of energy-dispercive microanalysis in scanning transmission electron microscopy. For better agreement of theory with experiment, an thermodynamic optimization was performed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In the 2 1st century, generation of electrical power will play a critical role due to constantly rising global population and increasing energy demand. While energy resources such as oil, coal and natural gas are being rapidly exhausted, environmental concerns of global warming due to CO(2) emissions are simultaneously imposing limits on consumption of these limited resources.
   Natural gas is one of the most efficient industrial fuels and therefore, over the last two decades, its use with stationary gas turbines has increased dramatically. New nickel based superalloys and advanced coating systems have been introduced to further advance the efficiency of such natural gas power generation equipment. While such new technologies increase the cost of newly manufactured parts, refurbishment of service exposed parts has become of increasing importance in the gas turbine business. For this reason, for example, modem joining methods have been developed to repair single crystal parts at significantly lower prices compared to manufacture of new parts.
   Repair of turbine hot gas path components is a proven service offered to customers by Siemens Power Generation (Siemens PG). Highly advanced brazing and welding processes are routinely applied to repair gas turbine parts. Particular concerns in the repair of such turbine parts made of cobalt and nickel based superalloys include high susceptibility to hot cracking during welding and post weld heat treating. Special technological subtleties must be applied for successful repair including use of ductile filler materials, welding methods with low heat input, hot box welding and complicated pre- and post-weld heat treatments to avoid weld cracking.
   This paper deals with some repair welding technologies currently used at Siemens PG.

AB Co-base superalloys have been applied in the stationary compoents of gas turbine owing to their excellent high temperaure properties. The stationary Co-base alloy components are generally manufactured by casting. Solidification behavior of the alloy is an important factor in the selection of casting parameters. In the present study, solidification microstructure and carbide formation behaviors were studied by directional solidification. Directional solidification experiments were carried out at the solidification rates of 0.5 similar to 150 mu m/s with the Co-base superalloy ECY768. Between the dendrites just below the final freezing temperature, MC carbide and M23C6 carbide were found. It was identified that the script or blocky carbides were Ta or W-rich MC carbide, and the lamellar carbides were Cr-rich M23C6 eutectic carbides. The solid/liquid interface morphology clearly showed that freezing of the Cr-rich eutectic carbide occurred just after the script type MC carbide.

TI Site occupancy of alloying elements in the L1(2) structure determined by
   channeling enhanced microanalysis in gamma/gamma ' Co-9Al-9W-2X alloys
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB Knowledge about the sublattice site preference of alloying elements in the L1(2)-gamma' phase of novel Co-base superalloys is a necessary pre-requisite to understand their influence on the properties of the alloys in general and the gamma' phase in particular. In the present study, the atomic site occupancy of the alloying elements in the L1(2)-gamma' structure in Co-9Al-9W-2X quaternary alloys after long-term annealing at 900 degrees C for 5000 h was determined using the atom location by channeling enhanced microanalysis (ALCHEMI) technique in combination with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) composition analysis in a transmission electron microscope (TEM). The experimental ALCHEMI data were evaluated by comparing them with those calculated by the program 'Inelastic Cross Section Calculator' (ICSC). The results show that Co mainly occupies one sublattice site and Al/W are located at the other sublattice site in the L1(2) unit cell in the ternary alloy. The additional elements Ti, V, Mo and Ta which partition strongly to the gamma' phase tend to occupy the Al/W sublattice site, and Cr which partitions more to the gamma phase also favors the AI/W sublattice site, while Ni weakly partitions into the gamma' phase and favors the Co sublattice site. The results of this study can provide evidence to the predictions on the site preference in literature based on the phase composition or on theoretical studies. (C) 2018 Acta Materialia Inc.

SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Present paper concerns primary structure of new type of tungsten-free cobalt-based superalloys with formula Co-Al-Mo-Nb. Due to replacement of W by addition of Mo and Nb, the desirable dual phase structure of gamma/gamma' should be formed after heat treatment of this alloy. In analyzed case, the alloy in as cast state was described. The Co-10Al-5Mo-2Nb (at%) alloy was casted via induction melting process. The specimens were cut from "foot" area of the rod and analyzed from phases and chemical point of view by XRD and EDS analysis. Detailed analysis of primary microstructure by light and scanning microscopy observations were performed. Obtained data revealed that in as cast state, the main phases detected in the alloy were solid solution of Co(AI,Mo,Nb) and Mo with Nb reach precipitations, probably with formula of Co-3(Mo,Nb). The morphology of observed interdendritic precipitations is typical for eutectic reaction. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Thermodynamic stability of Co-Al-W L1(2) gamma '
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB Co-based superalloys in the Co-Al-W system exhibit coherent L1(2) Co-3(Al,W) gamma' precipitates in an face-centered cubic Co gamma matrix, analogous to Ni3Al in Ni-based systems. Unlike Ni3Al, however, experimental observations of Co-3(Al,W) suggest that it is not a stable phase at 1173 K. Here, we perform an extensive series of density functional theory (DFT) calculations of the gamma' Co-3(Al,W) phase stability, including point defect energetics and finite-temperature contributions. We first confirm and extend previous DFT calculations of the metastability of L1(2) Co-3(Al0.5W0.5) gamma' at 0 K with respect to hexagonal close-packed Co, B2 CoAl and D0(19) Co3W using the special quasi-random structure (SQS) approach to describe the Al/W solid solution, employing several exchange/correlation functionals, structures with varying degrees of disorder, and newly developed larger SQSs. We expand the validity of this conclusion by considering the formation of antisite and vacancy point defects, predicting defect formation energies similar in magnitude to Ni3Al. However, in contrast to the Ni3Al system, we find that substituting Co on Al sites is thermodynamically favorable at 0 K, consistent with experimental observation of Co excess and Al deficiency in gamma' with respect to the Co-3(Al0.5W0.5) composition. Lastly, we consider vibrational, electronic and magnetic contributions to the free energy, finding that they promote the stability of gamma', making the phase thermodynamically competitive with the convex hull at elevated temperature. Surprisingly, this is due to the relatively small finite-temperature contributions of one of the gamma' decomposition products, B2 CoAl, effectively destabilizing the Co, CoAl and Co3W three-phase mixture, thus stabilizing the gamma' phase.

TI Effect of rhenium and cobalt additions on the microstructure and gamma

   superalloys grade MGA 1400
SO MATERIALS TESTING
AB The effect of rhenium and cobalt additions on the microstructure and gamma prime phase stability of modified nickel-based superalloy, grade MGA1400 by means of a vacuum arc melting method with different contents of rhenium (Re) and cobalt (Co) was investigated. After being subjected to heat treatment, the size of the gamma prime particles was slightly reduced with increasing rhenium content. Then, the alloys were exposed at a temperature of 1173 K for 1800 ks. The results showed that increasing the rhenium addition leads to a slower coarsening rate of the gamma prime particles. Furthermore, the shape of the gamma prime particles changed to a more cubic shape. However, an excessive rhenium content (> 1.21 wt.-%) promotes the formation of a topologically close-packed phase after a 360 ks exposure at 1173 K. It can be concluded that an increase in rhenium content can result in a lower coarsening rate of the gamma prime particles. The cobalt addition is beneficial for impeding or slowing the precipitation of topologically close-packed phases at an elevated temperature.

TI Formation of Cuboidal Co3AlC Precipitates in Carbon-Containing
   Co-Al-W-Based Superalloys
SO ADVANCED ENGINEERING MATERIALS
AB The influence of Carbon addition on a ternary Co-Al-W alloy is investigated especially regarding phase stability and partitioning behavior of alloying elements. During casting and subsequent cooling, C-additon leads to the formation of an interdendritic carbide network and to the homogeneous precipitation of cuboidal E2(1) phase, Co3AlC, in the W-rich Co matrix. The solvus temperature of this phase is found to be about 1200 degrees C, which is significantly higher than the solvus temperature of the ternary L12 phase Co-3(Al,W). In the course of solution heat treatment, the Co3AlC precipitates are dissolved and the carbides change in morphology and chemical composition. Further annealing leads to the precipitation of small cuboidal precipitates of L1(2) phase, Co-3(Al,W), and to a discontinuous precipitation of further phases.

TI Improvement of the high temperature oxidation of TaC-strengthened
   Co(Cr)-based cast superalloys by the addition of nickel
SO CORROSION ENGINEERING SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB In this work, nickel is added in substitution to cobalt in the composition of a cast cobalt-based chromium-rich superalloy designed to obtain a double-phased {fcc matrix + TaC} microstructure. Two nickel amounts were tested, 13 and 26 wt-%Ni, for 25 wt-%Cr, 0.4 wt-%C and 6 wt-%Ta, the rest being cobalt. The obtained as-cast microstructures are not different from the starting alloy's one, contrarily to the hardness which became lower. The oxidation tests at 1200 degrees C for 170 h demonstrated a significant improvement of the alloy's behaviour, especially for an addition of 26 wt-%Ni. This seems to be attributed to an easier Cr diffusion towards the oxidation front as suggested by the observed Cr contents in extreme surface as well as by the lower Cr concentration gradients. In addition, the TaC seemed to be morphologically more stable in the presence of nickel in the alloys than in the absence of Ni.

TI Effects of stacking fault energy on the creep behaviors of Ni-base
   superalloy
SO MATERIALS & DESIGN
AB Cobalt in a 23 wt.% Co containing Ni-base superalloys was systematically substituted by Ni in order to study the effects of stacking fault energy (SFE) on the creep mechanisms. The deformation microstructures of the alloys during different creep stages at 725 degrees C and 630 MPa were investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results showed that the creep life increased as the SFE decreased corresponding to the increase of Co content in the alloys. At primary creep stage, the dislocation was difficult to dissociate independent of SFE. In contrast, at secondary and tertiary creep stages the dislocations dissociated at gamma/gamma' interface and the partial dislocation started to shear gamma' precipitates, leaving isolated faults (IFs) in high SFE alloy, while the dislocations dissociated in the matrix and the partials swept out the matrix and gamma' precipitates creating extended stacking faults (ESFs) or deformation microtwins which were involved in diffusion-mediated reordering in low SFE alloy. It is suggested that the deformation microtwinning process should be favorable with the decrease of SFE, which could enhance the creep resistance and improve the creep properties of the alloys.

SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS RESEARCH
AB The isothermal oxidation experiments were carried out on several new /-strengthened cobalt-base alloys Co-Al-W-4Cr-0.02X (X = La, Ce, Dy, Y) at 900 and 800 degrees C. Due to an appropriate content of additional elements, the change in the morphology occurred and it significantly improved the oxidation resistance compared with those without Cr, among which the one with La elements shows the best oxidation resistance. Multiple oxide layers are also formed during the oxidation process, with CoWO4 and CoAl2O4 phases in the outer layer, and Cr, Al, W, and Co (e.g., Cr2O3) in the middle layer. The inner layer consists of some Al2O3 oxides, while more protective Al2O3 oxide was formed, esp. at the temperature of 800 degrees C. Both Cr2O3 and Al2O3 oxides were effectively protective oxides, which can prevent the intrusion of oxygen into the alloy substrate. Moreover, a phase transformation (/ to /Co3W) was observed at the interface between oxide layer and substrate.

TI On the microstructural evolution and partitioning behavior of
   L1(2)-structured gamma '-based Co-Ti-W alloys upon Cr and Al alloying
SO INTERMETALLICS
AB We report on the effects of Cr and Al on the microstructure and elemental partitioning behavior of gamma/gamma' forming Co-Ti-W-based alloys. Additions of Cr to a Co-15Ti-3W (at.%) base alloy at the expense of Ti led to a decrease in gamma' volume fraction, whereas Al additions at the expense of Co led to substantially increased gamma' volume fractions. Such alloy modifications resulted in reduced gamma/gamma' lattice misfits. Using atom probe tomography, we could show that Ti and W strongly partitioned to the gamma' phase, whereas Al and Cr partitioned to gamma. While Cr appeared to have only minor effects on the partitioning behavior of the other alloying elements, Al enhanced partitioning of Ti and in particular W to gamma', thus causing the observed increases in gamma' volume fraction.

SO OXIDATION OF METALS
AB Two {M-25Cr}-based alloys, with M = Co or Ni, containing 0.5C and 3.9Nb (wt%) to favor the crystallization of NbC carbides during solidification were prepared by casting and then subjected to oxidation in air at 1000, 1100 and 1200 A degrees C for 46 h. The results were studied by comparison with recent similar ones obtained with Nb-free ternary alloys issued from the same preparation protocol and tested in oxidation in the same conditions. In both cases interdendritic script-like-shaped NbC carbides were obtained as expected, however, not as single carbides in the nickel alloy which also contain chromium carbides. Preliminary exposure to 1200 A degrees C having shown a morphological evolution of the NbC, as-cast and preliminarily aged versions of both alloys were tested in oxidation. It appeared first that, whatever the aged state, the cobalt alloy behaved much worse than the nickel one, that the presence of Nb deteriorated the behavior in both cases and that aging the alloys, which resulted in NbC fragmentation, was also detrimental for the high-temperature oxidation behavior.

SO COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB First principles calculations are applied to study the phase stability and mechanical properties of sigma phase in cobalt-molybdenum (Co-Mo) system. Formation enthalpies have been used for the evaluation of stability, and are compared among the selected configurations. Based on the most energetically stable configurations, a ground-state line is sketched out for the Co-Mo sigma phase. Magnetic effects and electronic structures have also been explored to explain the compositional dependence of phase stability. The elastic constants and polycrystalline elastic moduli are calculated and exhibit similar compositional trends as the formation enthalpies. A significant degree of elastic anisotropy is predicted, which can shed light on the brittle nature and rapid crack propagation of sigma phase. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Microhardness Characterization of Fe- and Co-Based Superalloys
SO IRANIAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY TRANSACTION A-SCIENCE
AB The reverse indentation load-size effects of Fe-Mn-Si and Co-Mn-Si superalloy have been investigated by measuring Vickers hardness. The characterized superalloy samples are presented in the reverse indentation load-size effects, which is known as the microhardness increases with increasing applied load behavior. The theoretical model is rearranged and investigated according to the reverse indentation load-size effects using reconstituted Meyer law, proportional specimen resistance model, and modified proportional specimen resistance model. The reconstituted modified proportional specimen resistance model is highly suitable for describing the data of the Fe-Mn-Si and Co-Mn-Si alloys. SEM micrographs show that Co-based alloys exhibited a dendritic microstructure and Fe-based alloys were presented austenitic microstructure. In this study, the load range from 0.49 to 9.8N was applied to the materials, but no crack is observed on the surface of the material. This can only be attributed to the occurrence of the elastic deformation which yields reverse indentation size effect in these samples.

TI Early stages of scale formation during oxidation of gamma/gamma'
   strengthened single crystal ternary Co-base superalloy at 900 degrees C
SO CORROSION SCIENCE
AB A study on the individual role of gamma and gamma'-phase during the scale formation on Co-9Al-9W (at.%) at 900 degrees C was conducted. High-accuracy thermogravimetric analysis was used to locate changes in the kinetics of scale growth. Compositions of three separated layers within the scale have been elucidated in detail. The results demonstrate the substantial impact of the two-phase microstructure on the initiation of oxidation for the appearance of the scale. Examination of STEM-EDX elemental mappings of the internal oxidation front during the early stages of scale growth can explain the origin of isolated Al2O3 precipitates instead of a closed protective layer.

TI Protection of cobalt-based refractory alloys by chromium deposition on
   surface Part II: Behaviour of the coated alloys in oxidation at high
   temperature
SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB A high chromium content, typically 30 wt.%, is generally considered as necessary for cobalt-based alloys to allow them to resist oxidation by hot gases. Cobalt alloys with a bulk poorer in chromium may become resistant against high temperature oxidation if they are enriched in chromium on surface.The aim of this second part of the work is to expose to air at 1200 degrees C three low-chromium cobalt-based alloys (Co-10Cr, Co-10Cr-0.25C-4.4Ta and Co-10Cr-0.5C-8.7Ta in wt.%), previously enriched in chromium on surface by pack cementation, in order to examine if the applied cementation treatments are enough to ensure a good behaviour for a long time. The initial surface enrichment in chromium of the Ta-containing alloys, characterized by a maximal content on surface of about 30 wt.% Cr and a depth of enrichment of several hundreds of micrometers, gives them a good resistance to oxidation at 1200 degrees C, despite the very low-chromium content in the bulk. This is also due to the interdendritic TaC carbides which may facilitate outward diffusion of chromium during oxidation as they facilitated its inward diffusion during cementation. In contrast. the CoCr alloy, enriched in chromium in the same conditions did not display a so good oxidation behaviour. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   Cubic (FCC) Transition in Co-Re-Based Experimental Alloys Investigated
   by Neutron Scattering
SO METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND
   MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Co-Re-based alloys have been developed to supplement the Ni-base superalloys used in gas turbine applications at high temperatures (1473 K [1200 A degrees C] bare metal temperature). Unlike other commercial Co-based alloys, the Co matrix in the Co-Re alloys has a stable hexagonal close-packed (hcp) structure at room temperature. In situ neutron diffraction measurements on experimental Co-Re alloys hardened by carbide precipitates showed that the matrix undergoes an hcp a double dagger dagger face-centered cubic (fcc) allotropic transformation after heating to high temperatures. Furthermore, it was found that this transformation has a large hysteresis (similar to 100 K). Thermodynamic calculations were undertaken to study the high-temperature phase stability and transformations in the complex multicomponent, multiphase Co-Re-Cr-C system with or without the addition of Ta. The results show that the minor phases (Cr23C6-type carbides and the Cr2Re3-type sigma phase) play an important role in the hcp a double dagger dagger fcc hysteresis by influencing the partitioning of Cr and Re between the matrix and the other phases.

AB The effects of micro-additions of boron and zirconium on grain-boundary (GB) structure and strength in polycrystalline y(f.c.c.) plus y'(L1(2)) strengthened Co-9.5A1-7.5W-X at% alloys (X=0-Ternary, 0.05B, 0.01B, 0.05Zr, and 0.005B-0.05Zr at%) are studied. Creep tests performed at 850 degrees C demonstrate that GB strength and cohesion limit the creep resistance and ductility of the ternary B- and Zr-free alloy due to intergranular fracture. Alloys with 0.05B and 0.005B-0.05Zr both exhibit improved creep strength due to enhanced GB cohesion, compared to the baseline ternary Co-9.5A1-7.5W alloy, but alloys containing 0.01B or 0.05Zr additions display no benefit. Atom-probe tomography (APT) is utilized to measure GB segregation, where B and Zr are demonstrated to segregate at GBs. A Gibbsian interfacial excess of 5.57 +/- 1.04 atoms nm(-2) was found for B at a GB in the 0.01B alloy and 2.88 +/- 0.81 and 2.40 +/- 0.84 atoms nm(-2) for B and Zr, respectively, for the 0.005B-0.05Zr alloy. The GBs in the highest B-containing (0.05B) alloy exhibit micrometer-sized boride precipitates with adjacent precipitate denuded-zones (PDZs), whereas secondary precipitation at the GBs is absent in the other four alloys. The 0.05B alloy has the smallest room temperature yield strength, by 6%, which is attributed to the PDZs, but it exhibits the largest increase in creep strength (with an similar to 2.5 order of magnitude decrease in the minimum strain rate for a given stress at 850 degrees C) over the baseline Co-9.5A1-7.5W alloy.

AB The development of novel industrial cast and wrought (C&W) disk alloys with required combination of strength, creep and fatigue resistances is always desired and a challenge to material researchers. Recently, in the High Temperature Materials 21 Project (HTM21) led by the Japanese National Institute for Materials Science (NIMS), we proposed an innovative concept to design disk alloys. This concept is based on combining the characters of two kinds of gamma-gamma' two-phase alloys (Ni-base and Co-base alloys) and leads up to some promising candidate alloys that can be processed by normal C&W processing route and shows at least a 30 degrees C increase in temperature capability over the current C&W U720Li disk alloy. This paper shows the design idea, workability and mechanical properties of some Ni-Co-base alloys. Furthermore, full-scale-disk forgings were processed successfully for the evaluations of the processing ability and microstructure of new Ni-Co-base disk alloys, which demonstrated the advantages and possibility of Ni-Co-base disk alloys at the component level.

AB Silicon nitride (Si3N4) based ceramic tools exhibit good machinability in cutting materials such as gray cast iron, ductile iron, malleable cast iron, and superalloys due to excellent high-temperature mechanical properties. In this paper, high-performance Si3N4-based ceramic tools containing tungsten carbide (WC) and cobalt (Co) were studied. Effects of the WC content and Co content on mechanical properties and a microstructure of Si3N4-based ceramic materials were analyzed. Results showed that Si3N4-based ceramic material containing 10 wt % WC and 1 wt % Co had the best comprehensive mechanical properties at a sintering temperature of 1650 degrees C and holding time of 6 min, achieving Vickers hardness, fracture toughness, and room temperature bending strength of 16.96 GPa, 7.26 MPam(1/2), and 1132 MPa, respectively. The microstructure of Si3N4-based ceramic tool material is uniform without obvious abnormal growth. The Si3N4-based ceramic tool was mainly composed of -Si3N4, -Si3N4, and WC phases.

TI Kinetics of high temperature oxidation of chromium rich HfC reinforced
   cobalt based alloys
SO CORROSION ENGINEERING SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Mostly known to improve the high temperature oxidation resistance of superalloys, hafnium may also form carbides. Several per cents of Hf allow developing a dense carbide network to mechanically strengthen alloys. Here, the high temperature oxidation behaviour of three HfC containing cobalt alloys was characterised at all steps of a thermogravimetry test: heating, isothermal stage and cooling, compared with two Co-Cr-C model alloys. The five alloys were heated in synthetic air, maintained at 1200 degrees C during 50 h and then cooled. The mass gains were plotted versus time or according to (m x dm/dt=Kp-m x Kv) to specify the isothermal kinetic constants, or versus temperature to determine how oxidation acts during heating and oxide spallation occurs during cooling. Compared to the ternary alloys, the oxidation of the HfC reinforced alloys starts earlier but leads to lower mass gains during heating, the isothermal oxidation is faster and oxide spallation occurs later.

TI Grain Growth Behaviors of New Ni-Co Base Disk Superalloys during
   Solution Heat Treatment
SO JOURNAL OF THE JAPAN INSTITUTE OF METALS
AB The grain growth behaviors of a new Ni-Co-base superalloy (TMW-4M3) at various temperatures from 1100 degrees C to 1200 degrees C were investigated. The grain grew slowly below solvus temperature, T-s (T-s approximate to 1162 degrees C) and grew very quickly above the temperature because the primary gamma' dissolved completely. Therefore, we suggest that T-s approximate to 1162 degrees C is the gamma' solvus temperature for TMW-4M3 alloy. Meanwhile, below the gamma' solvus temperature, we found that the grain radius, R (pm) was a function of precipitate radius, r(gamma') (mu m) and volume fraction, f(v), of the primary gamma' phase, which could be expressed as,
   R=0.711.4.r(gamma')/integral v
   Thus, the grain growth behavior of the alloy within the gamma' sub-solvus temperature range, showed a good agreement with the Zener model.

TI Segregation assisted microtwinning during creep of a polycrystalline
   L1(2)-hardened Co-base superalloy
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB A polycrystalline L1(2)-hardened Co-base superalloy was creep deformed at 750 degrees C. The investigation of the deformed microstructure in the transmission electron microscope revealed microtwinning to be the prevailing deformation mechanism. The detected twins spanned the entire grain and cut through both, gamma and gamma'. Detailed high-resolution transmission electron microscopy investigations indicated that twin growth takes place by the slip of single a/6 (112) partial dislocations along the twin boundary. Further analysis of the twin boundaries in the gamma' phase revealed segregation of elements known to decrease the stacking fault energy and a local depletion of gamma' forming elements. We propose that this segregation behavior enables subsequent a/6 < 112 > dislocations to easily slip along the twin boundary and further thicken the twins in the process.

Isochronal annealing treatments were conducted at temperatures ranging from 300 to 800 degrees C, following the shock-loading. For annealing temperatures below 600 degrees C, the reload yield strengths and strain hardening rates were found to increase relative to the as-shocked condition, and only at temperatures above 600 degrees C was the expected softening observed. The microstructural changes responsible for these differences in mechanical properties were documented via TEM.

TI Assessing the kinetics and mechanisms of corrosion of cast and HIPed
   Stellite 6 in aqueous saline environments
SO CORROSION SCIENCE
AB Cobalt-base (Stellite) alloys have seen extensive use in wear environments mainly due to their high strength, corrosion resistance and hardness. Co-base superalloys rely primarily on carbides, formed in the Co matrix and at grain boundaries, for their strength and the distribution, size and shape of carbides depends on processing conditions. Currently use of Stellite alloys has extended into various industrial sectors (e.g. pulp and paper processing, oil and gas processing, pharmaceuticals, chemical processing) and the need for improved information regarding corrosion (and often tribo-corrosion) of Stellite alloys has increased. It has been recognised that processing changes, which affect the microstructure of Stellite alloys, will most probably affect the corrosion performance.
   In this paper the corrosion behaviour of Stellite 6 in the as-cast and the HIP consolidated forms has been compared and contrasted using DC electrochemical techniques in static saline conditions. It has been shown that there is a significant difference in the corrosion performance of HIP consolidated Stellite 6 and it is possible to link the corrosion mechanisms to the microstructure. The benefits of using HIPing as a manufacturing process for the corrosion performance of Stellite 6 are discussed. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI gamma '-(L1(2)) precipitate evolution during isothermal aging of a

AB The coarsening kinetics and elemental partitioning behavior of gamma'-(L1(2)) precipitates in a gamma(f.c.c.)-matrix for a model quaternary Co-8.8Al-8.9W-9.9Ni at.% superalloy are investigated utilizing isothermal aging conditions at 650, 800 and 900 degrees C. The gamma'-precipitate mean radius, number density, and volume fraction, at 800 and 900 degrees C, were studied using scanning electron microscopy; the calculated temporal exponents associated with coarsening of gamma'-precipitates display good agreement with model predictions for quasi stationary coarsening. An atom probe tomographic (APT) investigation of the aged gamma/gamma' microstructure at 650 degrees C demonstrates that the compositions and volume fractions of both phases vary continuously up to 4096 h. The aged microstructure at 650 degrees C consists of interconnected nanoscale gamma'-precipitates, corroborated utilizing SEM for the 4096 h aged-specimen. The activation energy for coarsening is estimated for the temperature range 650-900 degrees C to be 283 kJ mol(-1), in reasonable agreement with activation energies for diffusion of Al, W, and Ni in Co, suggesting that coarsening of gamma'-precipitates is limited by bulk-diffusion. APT measurements of specimens aged for 1024 hat 800 and 900 degrees C demonstrate that the isothermal aging temperature has a significant effect on the compositions and partitioning behavior of Co, Al, W and Ni between the gamma- and gamma'-phases. The partitioning ratio of the concentrations between the gamma'- and gamma-phases is largest for W, decreasing linearly from 5.3 +/- 0.1 at 650 degrees C to 2.1 +/- 1.2 at 900 degrees C, and smallest for Co, decreasing from 0.86 +/- 0.01 at 650 degrees C to 0.73 +/- 0.01 at 900 degrees C.

SO ANNALES DE CHIMIE-SCIENCE DES MATERIAUX
AB High temperature oxidation of cast cobalt-based alloys reinforced by different MC carbides (M = Ta, Nb, Hf or Zr) The aim of this work is to study if NbC, HfC and ZrC carbides can be obtained in a cobalt-based alloy, and what can be the high temperature behaviours of alloys containing such MC carbides in both stability and oxidation. Several alloys, all based on Co-8Ni-30Cr-0,2 or 0,4C (weight contents), and containing quantities of Nb, Hf or Zr which allow obtaining the same carbides densities, were synthesized by high frequency induction melting, and compared to a similar TaC-containing alloy. The as-cast alloys display NbC, HfC or ZrC carbides forming an interdendritic eutectic with matrix. After several tens hours at 1200 degrees C, all carbides are affected by a decrease in volume fraction and by a fragmentation phenomenon. This effect does not influence significantly the room temperature hardness of the alloys. Oxidation of the (Nb, Hf or Zr)C-containing alloys at 1200 degrees C is much faster than for a TaC-containing alloy. After thermogravimetry runs, external oxides formed on the (Nb, Hf or Zr)C-containing samples are mainly spinels while a TaC-containing alloy is still covered by chromia.

Interaction parameters for all the binary and ternary sub-systems are included. When possible they have been taken from the literature but, for several systems, partial or complete reassessment was needed, due to inconsistency of the phase models or incompatibility between assessments of different authors. As a result phase equilibria in selected commercial alloys are calculated. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SO SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY OF ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB A thermodynamic database for the Al-Co-Cr-Ni system is built via the Calphad method by extrapolating re-assessed ternary subsystems. A minimum number of quaternary parameters are included, which are optimized using experimental phase equilibrium data obtained by electron probe micro-analysis and x-ray diffraction analysis of NiCoCrAlY alloys spanning a wide compositional range, after annealing at 900 degrees C, 1100 degrees C and 1200 degrees C, and water quenching. These temperatures are relevant to oxidation and corrosion resistant MCrAlY coatings, where M corresponds to some combination of nickel and cobalt. Comparisons of calculated and measured phase compositions show excellent agreement for the beta-gamma equilibrium, and good agreement for three-phase beta-gamma-sigma and beta-gamma-alpha equilibria. An extensive comparison with existing Ni-base databases (TCNI6, TTNI8, NIST) is presented in terms of phase compositions.

TI Influences of the base element and of the carbide density on the high
   temperature oxidation of M-30Cr-xC alloys (M=Co, Ni, Fe). Part I: Study
   of the parabolic constants and of the chromia volatilization rates
SO ANNALES DE CHIMIE-SCIENCE DES MATERIAUX
AB The oxidation kinetics of twelve simple alloys, cobalt-base, nickel-base and iron-base, were studied at 1000, 1100 and 1200 degrees C. Ni-base, Fe-base (and Co-base only at 1000 degrees C and 1100 degrees C for some of them) alloys oxidize following a parabolic-type law, which was, in each case, analyzed according to d(Delta m/S)/dt as a function of 1/(Delta m/S). This allowed getting both the parabolic constant Kp and the chromia-volatilization constant Kv. These are equal to the slope and to the opposite of the ordinate at the origin of the obtained straight line, respectively. The Fe-base alloys oxidize faster than the Ni-base alloys, with sometimes a value of Kv which is really different from the former at the same temperature. The Co-base alloys are more prone to a catastrophic linear oxidation when T is higher than 1000 degrees C. Fortunately, a high density of interdendritic chromium carbides can lead to an improved behaviour.

TI High-temperature microstructures of ternary Co-30 wt.% Cr-based alloys
   over the [0-2.0 wt.%] carbon range
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB The Co-30 wt.% Cr-xC system was experimentally explored from x = 0 to 2 wt.%, by considering the stable microstructures at 1000, 1100 and 1200 degrees C, and the intervals of fusion. The strengthening potential and the refractoriness of several alloys belonging to this family were specified. Such simple alloys are able to display simultaneously a high amount of chromium for limiting hot corrosion, solidus temperatures as high as 1300 degrees C and refractory carbides fractions that can reach 20% in volume. Natures and fractions of carbides, and solidus temperatures were in good agreements with thermodynamic calculations. Inversely the measured liquidus temperatures were significantly higher than the calculated ones. In addition, thermodynamic modeling allowed to better interpret the disappearance of carbides due to oxidation at high temperature. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Oxidation Behaviour of Model Cobalt-Rhenium Alloys During Short-Term
   Exposure to Laboratory Air at Elevated Temperature
SO OXIDATION OF METALS
AB The alloys being used in high-temperature systems such as stationary gas turbines and aircraft engines are iron-, cobalt- and nickel-based superalloys, amongst which the latter is the most widely used for highest temperatures. However, the use of Ni-based alloys is limited to temperatures below 1,100 A degrees C. The experimental Co-Re-based alloys are promising for high-temperature applications for service temperatures beyond 1,200 A degrees C. The purpose of the present investigations, at this still early stage of the alloy development, is to gain a first insight into the oxidation mechanisms and to find ways to improve oxidation resistance of this class of materials. Thermogravimetric studies in combination with microstructural examinations of six model Co-Re alloys with different compositions showed the negative influence of rhenium on the oxidation resistance of Co-based alloys due to evaporation of rhenium oxide(s). Oxidation at 1,000 A degrees C in air yielded an oxide scale, that consists of a Co-oxide outer layer on a thick and porous Co-Cr oxide and a semicontinuous and therefore non-protective Cr-oxide film on the base metal substrate. This allowed for the vaporization of rhenium oxide formed during oxidation and hence led to a loss of Re. Computer-aided thermodynamic calculations were carried out to supplement the experimental analyses and were found to reasonably predict the stability ranges of the various oxide phases observed.

TI Cobalt based alloy PTA hardfacing on different substrate steels
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Components from equipment for different processing industries are exposed to severe service conditions. Parts are therefore manufactured so that specific demands can be met through adequate selection of surface processing techniques and hardfacing alloys. Whenever surface welding techniques are used to improve a component's performance, quality requirements such as controlled dilution of the deposited alloy by the substrate are a priority. This work has evaluated this interaction between a hardfacing Co based alloy and the substrate steel. A high carbon cobalt based alloy was 'plasma transferred arc' (PTA) deposited on three different substrate steels. The role of the chemical composition of the substrate on the characteristics of the coatings was evaluated for two sets of processing parameters, targeting two extreme dilution levels. Coatings characterisation was assessed through microstructure analysis, microhardness measurements, dilution levels, and wear rate measurements. Results showed that the influence of the substrate chemical composition was more significant for coatings of controlled low dilution deposits. The selection of the substrate steel affected dilution levels, microstructure, hardness values, and sliding wear rates exhibited by the coatings. On both sets of coatings deposits made on carbon steel gave better wear performance than those deposited on the stainless steels tested.

AB Nine cast alloys reinforced by very high fractions of carbides, Ni-30Cr-xC, Co-30Cr-xC and Fe-30Cr-xC with x varying from 1.2 to 2.0, were tested in oxidation at high temperature between 1,000 and 1,200 degrees C in air for 50 hours. After oxidation, their surfaces and sub-surfaces were characterized. Even for very high carbon contents, the chromia-forming behaviour of the nickel alloys is kept. The oxidation modes of the cobalt alloys and iron alloys are not changed compared to low carbon alloys of these families. The differences of diffusion easiness of chromium in matrix, between nickel alloys, cobalt alloys and iron alloys are the same as for alloys with lower carbon content.,;, as suggested by the lower chromium gradients in the nickel alloys compared to the two other alloy types. Sub-surface microstructure transformations due to oxidation were observed in some cases (coarsening of carbides due to an inwards diffusion of carbon, change of the sharing between BCC-FCC of iron matrix due to outwards diffusion of chromium). Catastrophic never occurred for these alloys during the 50 hours of exposition to air at high temperature.

TI Hot deformation behavior and DRX mechanism in a gamma-gamma '
   cobalt-based superalloy
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB gamma-gamma'cobalt-based superalloys have been the main focus of attention as a new class of high temperature materials. The present research studies the hot deformation, microstructure evolution, and dynamic recrystallization (DRX) mechanisms of a cast Co-Al-W superalloy during the hot compression process. The microstructure of the starting material is constituted of large MC carbide particles within a coarse grain structure. Two hot deformation regimes, i.e., low temperature (950 degrees C-1050 degrees C) and high temperature (1100 degrees C-1200 degrees C) were designed and performed. Flow curve and constitutive analysis using a hyperbolic sine equation evidenced two distinct behaviors among the regimes. Microstructural evaluation revealed a large volume fraction of fine gamma'particles with radius less than 100 nm, precipitated during heating and isothermal holding, which precluded DRX in the low temperature regime. In the high temperature regime, new grains were formed through a special discontinuous DRX at three different regions in the microstructure: original grain boundaries, vicinity of MC carbides and the interior of the relatively coarse grains; these may be attributed to the mechanisms of SIBM, PSN and sub-grain growth, respectively. A conceptual descriptive model for the especial DRX phenomenon was proposed.

AB The oxidation of multi-component alloys is complex and there are several competing oxidation reactions. This paper focuses on the oxidation performance of a gas.,turbine engine substrate, alloy 188. Co-Ni-Cr-W alloys can have a complex oxide structure that Vanes as a function of time and temperature. Alloy 188 was exposed in air at temperatures from 1050 to 1200 degrees C for up to 1500 h to determine its oxidation kinetics and to elucidate the form of damage accumulation.
   Previous results show parabolic corrosion kinetics at low (820 degrees C) temperatures and this work found similar kinetics above 1150 degrees C. However, in the mid temperature range, 1050-1100 degrees C, linear kinetics were observed.
   The performance of alloy 188 is of interest because of its use in turbines with oxidation resistant coatings designed to allow higher temperature operation than would normally be recommended.
   Because of the differing kinetics the lower temperature exposures give higher material loss than the higher temperature exposures at 1150 degrees C after 1500h. Rates of damage accumulation at 1050 degrees C were of the order of 10 mu m/h.

TI Thin-walled high temperature alloy structures fabricated from additively
   manufactured polymer templates
SO MATERIALS & DESIGN
AB Additive manufacturing is enabling a paradigm shift in design and production, but conventional techniques reach their limits when metallic structures require walls with <0.5 mm thickness. Here we introduce an approach for indirect additive manufacturing of thin-walled alloy structures. First a polymer template is additively manufactured, then metal layers are deposited by electroplating, physical or chemical vapor deposition. After removal of the polymer, the metal layers can be interdiffused to form an alloy via homogenization heat treatments. Three different alloys designed for three elevated temperature regimes are demonstrated: Monel alloys based on Ni-Cu-Al-Ti, nickel superalloys based on Ni-Cr-Al and refractory rhenium alloys based on Re-Co. A process was developed to co-deposit rhenium and cobalt via aqueous electroplating, resulting in an alloy with a melting point of 2000 degrees C and a Vickers hardness of 480 +/- 50 HV0.2 after homogenization. Two applications of interest for the aerospace industry were chosen to demonstrate the technology. High temperature truss core sandwich structures and rocket engine thruster demos where fabricated.

TI Lattice parameter misfit evolution during creep of a cobalt-based
   superalloy single crystal with cuboidal and rafted gamma-prime
   microstructures
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB A [h00] oriented Co-based superalloy single crystal was crept under tension at 940 degrees C/100 MPa, resulting in a P-type raft morphology with extensive particle coalescence along the [h00] loading direction. However, particle coalescence was also observed in two perpendicular directions on the (h00) plane, normal to the loading axis. Tensile creep experiments were performed with in-situ neutron diffraction at 800 degrees C/500 MPa on this initially rafted gamma' microstructure, and for comparison at (i) 900 degrees C/260 MPa, and at (ii) 750 degrees C/875 MPa, both with initially cuboidal gamma' microstructures. The alloy was shown to exhibit a positive lattice parameter misfit, and during the first hour of creep at 900 degrees C/260 MPa, the lattice parameter evolution indicated changes in phase composition associated with gamma' dissolution as the alloy achieved phase equilibrium at 900 degrees C. For all three in-situ creep measurements, there was a significant divergence of the gamma' and gamma lattice parameters as creep proceeded. The lattice parameter misfit values between the precipitates and the matrix approached their unconstrained values during creep, and were notably large compared to those of Ni-based superalloys. This is indicative of a loss of coherency at the precipitate/matrix interfaces. Such a loss of coherency at the precipitate/matrix interfaces will likely degrade certain mechanical properties such as fatigue resistance, as has been shown for the Ni-based superalloys.

TI Investigations on role of HVOF sprayed Co and Ni based coatings to
   combat hot corrosion
SO CORROSION ENGINEERING SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB This paper aims to investigate the hot corrosion resistance of high velocity oxy-fuel (HVOF) sprayed cobalt based (Stellite-6) and nickel based (Ni-20Cr) coatings deposited on the superalloy Superni-718 (Ni-19Cr-18.5Fe-5.13Ta-3.05Mo-0.9Ti-0.5Al-0.18Mn-0.18Si-0.15Cu0.04C) in the Na(2)SO(4)-60%V(2)O(5) salt environment at 900 degrees C under cyclic conditions. The X-ray diffractometry, scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive analysis and electron probe microanalyser techniques were used to study the corrosion products with respect to their morphology, phase composition and element concentration. The thermogravimetric technique was used to establish the kinetics of corrosion. The bare alloy underwent severe hot corrosion attack. The Ni-20Cr coating shows excellent hot corrosion resistance with negligible spallation, whereas Stellite-6 coating reveals less hot corrosion resistance and more spallation. The hot corrosion resistance of Ni-20Cr coating has been attributed to the formation of oxides of chromium, nickel and spinel of nickel chromium. The oxides of silicon, chromium, cobalt and spinels of cobalt-chromium and nickel-chromium have contributed for hot corrosion resistance of Stellite-6 coatings.

TI Effect of temperature and reactivity of molten 55Al-Zn alloy on Co based
   alloy coatings
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The short service life of bearings in galvanising industry is a result of a complex set of deterioration mechanisms. This work addressed the effect of temperature and molten bath reactivity on the material of the bearings respectively. Three commercial alloys, the Co-Cr-W Stellite 6 and Co-Cr-Mo-Si Tribaloy (T400 and T800) alloy systems, were deposited by plasma transferred arc on AISI 316L plates. Coatings were evaluated for the effect of temperature exposure on hardness, microstructure and sliding abrasive wear. The reactivity with the molten 55Al-Zn alloy was assessed by immersion tests in an industrial bath. Results showed that exposure at 600 degrees C for 168 h resulted in an increase in hardness, microstructure changes and loss of wear resistance for the Stellite 6 coatings. A superior performance to temperature was shown by Tribaloy T800 with a stable abrasive wear resistance. The three alloys exhibited a strong reactivity with the 55Al-Zn molten bath. An intermetallic layer formed on the coatings as the Al from the bath reacted with elements from the Co based alloys. This reactivity consumed the coatings, causing a reduction on thickness particularly on those processed with the T800 alloy.

SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Five cast cobalt alloys based on Co-M-30Cr-0.4/0.45C and containing Ta, Nb, Hf and/or Zr were studied by metallography in the as-cast condition and after treatments at 1300 degrees C. The obtained MC carbides were all interdendritic with a eutectic script-like morphology. For similar carbon contents, the HfC carbides are the most developed in the as-cast microstructure and the most stable at 1300 degrees C. As-cast, the TaC carbides are less developed than the former and they tend to become more firactioned and less present in microstructure at 1300 degrees C. The NbC carbides, which have initially the same morphology and the same fraction as TaC rapidly dissolve at 1300 degrees C. The cobalt alloys containing HfC or TaC are chromia - forming at 1300 degrees C. The NbC-containing alloy catastrophically oxides after only few hours at 1300 degrees C. The average hardness is the highest for the WC-containing alloy and the lowest for the W-containing alloy. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Energetics of cobalt alloys and compounds and solute-vacancy binding in
   fcc cobalt: A first-principles database
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB Using extensive first-principles density functional calculations, we calculate thermodynamic properties of binary fcc cobalt-based alloys with 25 different solute elements. For each solute element X, we calculate its (a) nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor solute-vacancy binding energy, (b) dilute impurity mixing energy with respect to the equilibrium and hypothetical fcc-based reference states of the solute, (c) enthalpy of formation of cobalt-rich binary ordered compounds in the Co-X system, (d) solubility enthalpy, and other derived quantities. We find that the solute-vacancy binding energies of all the studied solutes in fcc cobalt are positive (indicating favorable binding), in contrast to nickel, aluminum, magnesium, and copper-based alloys, where mid 3d transition metal solutes have unfavorable solute -vacancy binding. We study the physical and chemical effects influencing solute-vacancy binding energy, and find that (a) it correlates broadly with solute size larger solute atoms possess stronger binding with vacancies and this is understood in terms of strain relief and secondary next-nearest-neighbor interactions, and (b) it follows a parabolic trend as a function of d-occupancy across the transition metal series falling to a minimum at the middle of the series and this is understood in terms of a d band filling effect. We also find this d-band filling effect in other calculated quantities such as the dilute impurity volumes and dilute impurity mixing energies. To aid in building thermodynamic databases, we tabulate all the calculated thermodynamic quantities, and compare them with experimental phase diagrams data and previous literature, and find good agreement where such data is available.

TI Electrochemical characterisation of novel gamma/gamma '-strengthened
   Co-base superalloys
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB Electrochemical behaviour of a new gamma/gamma'-strengthened Co-base superalloy with the composition Co-9Al-9W-0.12B (in at%) was studied in comparison with pure Co at room temperature in 1 M Na2SO4 (pH 5.9) and 0.1 M NaOH (pH 12.8) aqueous solutions. Pure Co and the Co-base superalloy show passive behaviour in both solutions. Impedance spectra measured at the corrosion potential indicate comparable impedance values for the alloy and pure Co in neutral solution, but in alkaline solution the alloy shows a lower corrosion rate. Polarisation curves indicate a limited range of passivity for both materials in neutral solution. In alkaline solution, the alloy and pure Co show similar (albeit not identical) primary and secondary ranges of passivity, as previously described in the literature for pure Co. Furthermore, lower passive current densities are observed for the superalloy in the primary range of passivity. As the superalloy studied in this work is a promising material for high temperature applications, we moreover compared the corrosion behaviour of oxidised alloy surfaces with the bare alloy surface. For this, isothermal oxidation of the gamma/gamma'-strengthened Co-base superalloy was carried out in air at 800 degrees C and 900 degrees C for 24 h and 500 h. Compared to unoxidised Co-Al-W-B alloys and pure Co samples, the high temperature oxide scales provide orders of magnitude higher protection with good barrier properties in a potential range between -1 and +2V (vs. Ag/AgCl). In general, longer oxidation times and a higher oxidation temperature result in the formation of more protective oxide layers. The protective effect of the high temperature oxide layers is discussed in view of their thickness and chemical composition. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Effects of titanium substitutions for aluminum and tungsten in
   Co-10Ni-9Al-9W (at%) superalloys
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB Polycrystalline Co-10Ni-(9 - x)Al-(9 - x)W-2xTi at% (x = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4) alloys with gamma(f.c.c.) plus gamma'(L1(2)) microstructures are investigated, where the gamma'(L1(2))-formers Al and W are replaced with Ti. Upon aging, the initially cuboidal gamma'(L1(2))-precipitates grow and develop a rounded morphology. After 256 h of aging at 1000 degrees C, the precipitates in the 6 and 8 at% Ti alloys coalesce and develop an irregular, elongated morphology. After 1000 h of aging, replacement of W and Al with Ti increases both the mean radius, < R >, and volume fraction, phi, of the gamma'(L1(2))-phase from < R > = 463 nm and phi = 8% for 2 at% Ti to < R > = 722 nm and phi = 52% for 8 at% Ti. Composition measurements of the gamma(f.c.c.)-matrix and gamma'(L1(2))-precipitates demonstrate that Ti substitutes for W and Al in the gamma'(L1(2))-precipitates, increases the partitioning of W to gamma'(L1(2)), and changes the partitioning behavior of Al from a mild gamma'(L1(2))-former to a mild gamma(f.c.c.)-former. The grain boundaries in the aged alloys exhibit W-rich precipitates, most likely mu(Co7W6)-type, which do not destabilize the gamma(f.c.c.) plus gamma'(L1(2)) microstructure within the grains. Four important benefits accrue from replacing W and Al with Ti: (i) the alloys' mass density decrease; (ii) the gamma'(L1(2))-solvus temperature increases; (iii) the gamma'(L1(2)) volume fraction formed during aging at 1273 K (1000 degrees C) increases; and (iv) the 0.2% offset flow stress increases.

TI Shearing of gamma ' particles in Co-base and Co-Ni-base superalloys
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB Shearing mechanisms of the primary strengthening phase in cobalt-base and cobalt-nickel-base super-alloys, gamma' (L1(2)), are investigated at the elementary defect level by using a combination of generalized-stacking-fault energy (GSF) calculations and phase field simulations. The GSF energy surfaces of the gamma and gamma' phases, as determined from available experimental data and ab initio calculations, are used in the phase field simulations. Sophisticated deformation pathways leading to various planar defects including antiphase boundaries (APB), remnant superlattice intrinsic stacking faults (SISF), APB-SISF-APB ribbons and SISF islands are predicted as a function of alloy composition and particle shapes. The predicted stacking fault configurations for both alloys are consistent with recent transmission electron microscopy observations. Effects of dislocation line tension difference in gamma and gamma' phases and planar defect energy variation due to segregation at the planar defects are discussed. The detailed dislocation core structures, effects of dislocation line tension differences on deformation mechanisms, and unique deformation mechanisms uncovered, which include stacking fault ribbon shearing, antiphase boundary shearing, and mixed modes, could be used to improve constitutive microstructure-property relationships in advanced crystal plasticity modeling and to assist in alloy design.

TI Corrosion behaviour assessment of cast and HIPed Stellite 6 alloy in a
   chloride-containing environment
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB Cobalt-base (Stelae) alloys have seen extensive use in wear environments mainly due to their high strength, corrosion resistance and hardness. Co-base superalloys rely primarily on carbides formed in the Co matrix and at grain boundaries, for their strength and wear resistance. The distribution, size and shape of carbides depend on processing conditions. Currently, the use of Stellite alloys has extended into various industrial sectors (e.g. pulp and paper processing, oil and gas processing, pharmaceuticals, chemical processing) and the need for improved information regarding corrosion of Stellite alloys has increased. It has been recognized that processing changes, which affect the microstructure of Stellite alloys, most affect corrosion resistance.
   In this work the corrosion behaviour of Stellite 6 alloy in the as-cast and the HIPed consolidated forms is compared and contrasted using DC and AC electrochemical techniques in static saline conditions. The results show that there is a significant difference in the corrosion performance of HIP consolidated Stellite 6 and it is possible to link the corrosion behaviour to the microstructure. The benefits of using HIPing as a manufacturing process for the corrosion performance of Stellite 6 are discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The density of liquid NiCoAlMo quaternary alloy with a fixed molar ratio of Ni:Co:Al (x(Ni):x(Co):x(Al)approximate to 73:12:15) which is close to the average value of the commercial Ni-based superalloys TMS75, INCO713, CM247LC and CMSX-4, and molybdenum concentration change from 0% to 10% (mass fraction) was measured by a modified sessile drop method. It is found that the density of the liquid NiCoAlMo quaternary alloy decreases with increasing of temperature, but increases with the increase of molybdenum concentration in the alloys. The molar volume of liquid NiCoAlMo quaternary alloy increases with the increase of temperature and molybdenum concentration, and shows a negative deviation from the ideal linear mixing. The liquid density of NiCoAlMo quaternary alloy calculated from the partial molar volumes of nickel, cobalt, aluminum and molybdenum in the corresponding Ni-bases binary alloy are in good agreement with the experimental results; it means that within the error tolerance range the density of liquid Ni-based multi-component alloys can be predicted from the partial volumes of elements in Ni-based binary alloys in liquid state.

TI The microstructure and hardness of Ni-Co-Al-Ti-Cr quinary alloys
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB The effects of Ni:Co and Al:Ti ratios on the room temperature microstructure, hardness and lattice parameter of twenty-seven quinary Ni-Co-Al-Ti-Cr alloys have been evaluated. All of the alloys exhibited a uniform gamma-gamma' microstructure. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) showed that the liquidus and solidus temperatures of the alloys increased with greater Al: Ti ratios, decreased with Cr concentration and remained largely unchanged with respect to the Ni:Co ratio. Neutron diffraction measurements of the gamma and gamma' lattice parameters revealed that the lattice misfit in all of the alloys was positive and increased with Ti concentration (i.e. lower Al:Ti ratio) regardless of the concentration of Cr, or the ratio of Ni: Co. Importantly, alloys with a Ni:Co ratio of 1:1, were found to have consistently greater lattice misfits than alloys with Ni:Co ratios of either 1:3 or 3:1. The measured lattice misfits were found to be strongly correlated with the Vickers hardness of the alloys, suggesting that lattice misfit plays a key role in the strengthening of gamma-gamma' alloys of this type.

TI Temporal evolution of a model Co-Al-W superalloy aged at 650 degrees C

SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB The temporal evolution of a gamma(f.c.c.)/gamma' (L1(2)) Co-8.8Al-73 W superalloy aged at 650 degrees C (10 min-4096 h) and 750 degrees C (10 min-256 h) is studied utilizing atom-probe tomography (APT), scanning electron microscopy, and Vickers microhardness testing. The evolution of the phase compositions, gamma' (L1(2)) volume fraction, and mean precipitate radius, <R2-D(t)>, are determined. Coarsening rate constants and temporal exponents are calculated for <R-D(t)> of the gamma' (L1(2))-nanoprecipitates. The temporal exponents are found to be generally close to 1/p = 1/3 as required for diffusion-limited coarsening. Tungsten solid-solubility is significantly reduced in the gamma(f.c.c.)-matrix at 650 degrees C (0.54 +/- 0.04 at. %) and 750 degrees C (1.35 +/- 0.06 at. %) when compared with aging at 900 degrees C (5.5 at. %). The value of <R-2D(t)> of the gamma' (L1(2))-nanoprecipitates increases with increasing aging time corresponding to an increase in the Vickers microhardness; the peak strength was not, however, achieved for the aging times investigated. The morphology of the gamma' (L1(2))-nanoprecipitates begins as spheroids but transitions to cuboids at longer aging times, with final the gamma' (L1(2)) volume fractions for aging at 650 degrees C and 750 degrees C being phi = 53% and 54%, respectively. The effect of quench-rate (either furnace-cooled, air-cooled, oil quenched, or water quenched) from a supersolvus temperature of 1050 degrees C on the microstructure of the alloy is also investigated. Slow cooling (furnace and air-cooling) is shown to result in a uniform distribution of nanometer sized gamma' (L1(2))-nanoprecipitates, unlike Ni-based superalloys in which the gamma' (L1(2))-nanoprecipitates form in a non-uniform or multimodal distribution.

   Characterization of the sub-surface microstructure
SO ANNALES DE CHIMIE-SCIENCE DES MATERIAUX
AB The surface states of twelve chromia-forming simple alloys based on Co, Ni and Fe oxidized during 50 hours at 1000 degrees C, 1100 degrees C and 1200 degrees C were examined. The nickel alloys display an external scale that is essentially chromia. The oxides present on the surfaces of the iron base and cobalt base alloys are more complex. The depths of the carbide-free zones that developed from the surface increase when the initial carbide fraction of the alloys decreases, and there is always a part of chromium supplied on the oxidation front by dissolving carbides. Hence the mass of carbon released by the latter must be taken into account in the mass gain results to get more precise values of the Kp and Kv rate-constants. The treatment according to the d(Delta m/S)/dt versus 1/(Delta m/S) plot may not be really correct when the external oxides are of several types. It is possible that chromia volatilization could be limited by the presence of Fe in the Cr-containing M2O3 oxides or of covering parts of CoO.

TI First-principles investigation of electronic, mechanical and
   thermodynamic properties of L1(2) ordered Co-3(M, W) (M = Al, Ge, Ga)
   phases
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB Studies were carried out on the equilibrium structural, temperature-dependent mechanical and thermodynamic properties of the Co-3(M, W) (M = Al, Ge, Ga) phases in terms of first-principles calculations. The results of the ground-state elastic constants revealed that Co-3(M, W) phases are mechanically stable and possess intrinsic ductility. It was found that the elastic heat-resistant properties of Co-3(Ge, W) phase are inferior to those of Co-3(Al, W) and Co-3(Ga, W). Analyzing the charge density difference provides the explanation that the sharp decrease in mechanical properties is mainly due to the weakening of Co-Ge bonding at elevated temperatures for Co-3(Ge, W). The elastic anisotropy as a function of temperature is discussed using a universal index. It is observed that Co-3(M, W) phases show a high degree of elastic anisotropy. The degree of elastic anisotropy could be significantly decreased by an increase in temperature for Co-3(M, W). The lattice vibration is treated with the quasiharmonic phonon approach, considering both the vibrational and thermal electronic contributions. The thermodynamic properties as a function of temperature are computed without any adjustable parameters, including heat capacity, entropy, enthalpy and thermal expansion coefficient.

TI Effect of solute segregation on the intrinsic stacking fault energy of
   Co-based binary alloys: A first-principles study
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Segregation of solute atoms to stacking faults (Suzuki segregation) and their interactions are of longstanding attention since it has a deep impact on mechanical properties. In this study, we systematically investigate the segregation behavior of different solute atoms in fcc Co-based binary alloys and its effect on the intrinsic stacking fault energy (SFE) using first-principles density-functional-theory (DFT) calculations. Interestingly, while Mo, W, Cr, Mn and Al atoms have a strong tendency to Suzuki segregation with some significant energy barriers, Ni atom has no tendency of segregation and only Fe atom has extremely low energy barriers. A strong segregation effect on the intrinsic SFE was observed and it only extends at a few atomic layers in the vicinity of the intrinsic stacking fault plane. The results are consistent with observed solute segregation in similar alloys and commercial superalloys then it would be useful for SFE modeling and Co-based alloys design. Furthermore, the effect of solute concentrations and changes in the electronic features (charge density difference and density of states) are also investigated. A mutual interaction between solutes and stacking faults enhanced local bonding between the solute atom and the adjacent Co atoms, resulted in the lower intrinsic SFE, thus favoring Suzuki segregation.

SO MATERIALS CHARACTERIZATION
AB Fourteen nickel-base superalloy single crystals containing a range of chromium (Cr), cobalt (Co), molybdenum (Mo), and rhenium (Re) levels, and fixed amounts of aluminum (Al) and tantalum (Ta), were examined to determine the effect of bulk composition on basic microstructural parameters, including gamma' solvus, gamma' volume fraction, topologically close-packed (TCP) phases, gamma and gamma' phase chemistries, and gamma-gamma' lattice mismatch. Regression models describing the influence of bulk alloy composition on each of the microstructural parameters were developed and compared to predictions by a commercially-available software tool that used computational thermodynamics Co produced the largest change in gamma' solvus over the wide compositional range explored and Mo produced the biggest effect on the gamma lattice parameter over its range, although Re had a very potent influence on all naicrostructural parameters investigated. Changing the Cr, Co, Mo, and Re contents in the bulk alloy had an impact on their concentrations in they gamma matrix and to a smaller extent in the gamma' phase. The software tool under-predicted gamma' solvus temperatures and gamma' volume fractions, and over-predicted TCP phase volume fractions at 982 degrees C. However, the statistical regression models provided excellent estimations of the microstructural parameters and demonstrated the usefulness of such fummlas. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The molybdenum content of CoMoP alloys is 0.7-1.0 at.% at 5 to 8 at.% P. The electrolytic tungsten alloys are nanocrystalline and subgrains are 4 to 7 nm in size. The nanohardness of tungsten-rich alloys similar to 13 GPa) is comparable with that of electrolytic chromium coatings. The wear resistance of the deposited alloys is quite high and is commensurable with that of hard coatings such as TiB2, TiN, and TiAlN. The tribooxidation of FeW alloys in dry friction is revealed. The corrosion resistance of the coatings is similar to that for electrolytic chromium.

AB Blades and vanes made from Ni - and Co - base superalloys that are used in the hot section of all gas turbine engines are coated to enhance resistance to hot corrosion. The most widely used coatings are those based on the intermetallic compounds NiAl and CoAl, which are formed by diffusion interaction of aluminium with surfaces of the nickel and cobalt alloys, respectively. Simple aluminide coatings resist high - temperature oxidation by the formation of protective layer of alumina and can be used up to about 1 150 degrees C. The coatings degrade by loss of aluminium due to spalling of oxides under thermal cycling conditions. HPT blades of DV - 2 jet engines are made from Ni - based superalloy ZS6K. For improving alloy's high temperature resistance are blades coated with Al - Si diffusion layer. Depending on jet engine flying regime an overcrossing of working temperature may occur. It may result into coarsening of the gamma prime particles, thus decreasing its strengthening effect. A real case study of DV-2 jet engine turbine blades after high temperature exposition is discussed in this article. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Low cycle fatigue behavior was studied at 400,650 and 725 degrees C in the total strain ranges of 0.79-1.22% for a recently developed Ni-base superalloy containing high Co and Ti contents. Detailed examinations were conducted on cyclic hardening/softening behavior, deformation substructure, fatigue life, as well as crack initiation and subsequent propagation. Continuous cyclic hardening at 400 degrees C was observed whereas cyclic softening at 650 and 725 degrees C was examined, except at 650 degrees C and low strain range (0.8%) where alloy exhibited relative stable stress response until crack initiation. Transmission electron microscopy analysis suggests that cyclic hardening is caused by the inhomogeneous dislocation activity and interactions of dislocations, and cyclic softening is related to shearing of gamma prime precipitates by stacking faults and coupled dislocation pairs combining with thermal activation process. The relation between fatigue life and plastic strain followed the Coffin-Manson law. Fatigue cracks often initiated on or near the surfaces of specimen during cycling, while subsurface carbide clusters initiation was also observed. Oxidation accelerated crack propagation at 650 and 725 degrees C. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI The effect of Ni additions on the oxidation behaviour of Co-Re-Cr
   high-temperature alloys
SO MATERIALS AT HIGH TEMPERATURES
AB The present study focused on the influence of Ni on the microstructure and oxidation behaviour of Co-Re-Cr-based alloys. Alloys with three different Ni contents were tested in laboratory air at 800-1100 degrees C. A refinement and a reduction of the sigma phase volume fraction as well as a change in the matrix microstructure were observed. Thermogravimetric measurements showed that the alloys with higher Ni contents possess a better oxidation resistance when exposed to higher temperatures. All alloys suffered from continuous mass loss during oxidation at 800 degrees C due to the formation of porous oxides scales, consisting of Co3O4, Co(Ni)O and Ni-doped CoCr2O4, which allow the evaporation of Re-oxides. At 900-1100 degrees C, only the alloy with 25 at. % Ni showed parabolic oxidation kinetics after a short period of transient oxidation. This is a result of the fast formation of a protective Cr2O3 layer. It was also found that exposure to air at 1000 degrees C leads to a phase transformation of the bulk material; an oxidation-induced formation of fine hexagonal close-packed (hcp) grains was observed near the oxide scales. It is supposed that the improved oxidation resistance of Ni-containing Co-Re-Cr alloys is a result of enhanced Cr diffusion caused by the Ni addition. The extensive formation of the fcc phase in the alloy matrix had a detrimental effect on the oxidation behaviour of the Ni-containing Co-Re-Cr-based alloys.

TI Experimental and thermodynamic investigations regarding the effect of
   chromium on the carbides population in cast {Ni(bal.)-0.4C-6Ta-xCr}
   alloys with x varying from 0 to 50 wt%
SO CALPHAD-COMPUTER COUPLING OF PHASE DIAGRAMS AND THERMOCHEMISTRY
AB Involving a particularly strong carbide-former metallic element, the tantalum carbides are potentially very stable at elevated temperatures in term of volume fraction and morphology. The TaC phase represents a major strengthening way to allow cast chromium-rich superalloys resisting mechanical stresses at elevated temperatures. They are exploited in recent high performance cobalt-based superalloys but seemingly not in nickelchromium refractory alloys. Earlier studies showed that the stability of TaC in Ni-Cr alloys is not so good as in the Co-Cr ones, and they evidenced that chromium carbides may compete with TaC in the formation of the carbides population. A possible way to optimize the presence of TaC in Ni-Cr alloy may consist in rating the chromium content to an ideal value but preliminary knowledge about the TaC dependence on the Cr content is compulsory. The aim of this work is precisely the investigation of the effect of the content in chromium on the appearance and stability of the TaC phase in Ni-Cr alloys, by the means of thermodynamic calculations and real experiments in parallel. A global system Ni(bal.)-xCr-0.4C-6Ta compositions (with x varying from 0 to 50 wt%) was chosen. Thermodynamic calculations were performed to know the theoretic metallurgical states inside the considered x range. These theoretic results being dependent on the suitability of the used database, real experiments of verifications were also carried out for a selection of six alloys (x = 0, 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 wt%). The alloys prepared by respecting these compositions were cast and isothermally exposed at high temperature (1400 and 1510 K), then subjected to metallographic characterization. For the used database the calculated results showed that no TaC should never appear whatever their Cr content, while TaC were really observed in the as-cast and aged versions of the alloys containing 20 wt%Cr and more, but never alone since chromium carbides were systematically also present. When the Cr content in the alloy is too low, the TaC are rare or even no present. This allowed concluding first that the database used for the calculations needs serious improvements, followed by tests with, as first criteria of quality, a good correspondence with the present experimental results. Second, the presence of Cr in quantity high enough is surprisingly compulsory to obtain TaC carbides in quantity high enough, but it is no possible to avoid the appearance of chromium carbides. Obviously, other ways than Cr adjustments must be found to obtain TaC in nickel-based alloys as the single carbide phase and in quantity high enough to achieve high mechanical properties at high temperature.

TI Effect of Co on Microstructure and Stress Rupture Properties of K4750
   Alloy
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA-ENGLISH LETTERS
AB The effects of substituting Co for Fe on the microstructure and stress rupture properties of K4750 alloy were studied. The microstructure of the alloy without Co (K4750 alloy) and the alloy containing Co (K4750-Co alloy) were analyzed. Substitution of Co for Fe inhibited the decomposition of MC carbide and the precipitation of eta phase during long-term aging treatment. In K4750-Co alloy, the morphology of MC carbide at the grain boundary (GB) remained dispersed blocky shape and no eta phase was observed after aging at 750 degrees C for 3000 h. However, in K4750 alloy, almost all the MC carbides at GBs broke down into granular M23C6 carbide and needle-like eta phase. The addition of cobalt could delay the decomposition of MC carbides, which accordingly restricted the elemental supply for the formation of eta phase. The stress rupture tests were conducted on two alloys at 750 degrees C/430 MPa. When Co is substituted for Fe in K4750 alloy, the stress rupture life increased from 164.10 to 264.67 h after standard heat treatment. This was mainly attributed to increased concentration of Al, Ti and Nb in gamma ' phase in K4750-Co alloy, which further enhanced the strengthening effect of gamma ' phase. After aging at 750 degrees C for 3000 h, substitution of Co for Fe can also cause the stress rupture life at 750 degrees C/430 MPa to increase from 48.72 to 208.18 h. The reason was mainly because MC carbide degradation and eta phase precipitation in K4750 alloy, which promoted the initiation and propagation of micro-crack during stress rupture testing.

TI SULFIDATION-OXIDATION BEHAVIOR OF A NI-CO-CR-SI ALLOY IN AN SO2+O2
   ATMOSPHERE
SO OXIDATION OF METALS
AB The high-temperature-corrosion behavior of a Ni-Co-Cr-Si superalloy (HAYNES Alloy HR-160) in an SO2+O2 (SO2:O2=2:1) has been studied at 625-degrees-C and 750-degrees-C. Alloy samples were corroded for 72 hr, followed by XRD, SEM, EDS, and XPS analysis on the surface and/or cross-section of the samples, It was found that the simultaneous nucleation of nickel and cobalt oxides and chromia at the initial stage lead to the subsequent formation of a sulphate layer on reaction with the gas phase. This eventually lead to the formation of a thick sulphide layer above the chromia scale. The stable phases for Cr, Ni, and Co in such an atmosphere are chromia as well as Ni and Co sulphates. The existence of a thin sulphate layer was suggested some time ago but could not be detected and was disputed. The XPS analysis in this work now provides evidence for the existence of this sulphate layer. The transport of sulphur through the oxide scale into the alloy substrate is discussed It was concluded that sulphur advanced into the substrate by the oxidation of sulphides, thus liberating the sulphur. The possibility of sulphur transport in the form of SO2 molecules was also discussed. Based on the results and discussion, a schematic corrosion mechanism is presented.

   Evolution of a New gamma-gamma ' Strengthened Cobalt-Based Superalloy
SO METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND
   MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Recently, cobalt-based gamma-gamma' microstructured superalloys have attracted attention. However, studies on their processing behavior [i.e., processing maps (the variation of strain rate sensitivity (m) with temperature)] are limited. Thus, the high-temperature flow behavior of a gamma-gamma' Co-30Ni-10Al-5Mo-2Ta-2Ti-5Cr (at. pct) superalloy was investigated using isothermal compression tests between 1348 and 1498 K at strain rates from 0.001 to 10 s(-1). The m contour map was generated using the experimental flow stress values, which were used to locate the optimum hot workability and desired microstructural processing range. A strong dependence of m on the deformation parameters (temperature, strain rate, and strain) was observed. A maximum m value of around 0.3 at 1460 K to 1498 K and strain rates of 0.01 to 0.5 s(-1) was found. The deformed samples show a fully recrystallized microstructure at high m. Unstable domains showed the formation of cavities at the grain boundary triple points and cracks along the grain boundaries at high strain rates (1 to 10 s(-1)), corresponding to m < 0.10. A constitutive model was developed using an Arrhenius hyperbolic sine function, yielding an apparent activation energy of 540 +/- 30 kJ mol(-1) for hot deformation. This study indicates reasonable formability under certain conditions below the solvus, thus opening possibilities for further thermomechanical treatment.

CT 17th International Conference on Wear of Materials
CY APR 19-23, 2009
CL Las Vegas, NV
AB Multi-component metallic alloys have been developed to withstand high-temperature service in corrosive environments. Some of these applications, like exhaust valve seats in internal combustion engines. must also resist sliding, impact, and abrasion. The conjoint effects of temperature, oxidation, and mechanical contact can result in accelerated wear and the formation of complex surface layers whose properties differ from those of the base metal and the oxide scale that forms in the absence of mechanical contact. The authors have investigated the effects of prior surface damage, produced by scratch tests, on the localized reformation of oxide layers. Three high-performance commercial alloys, based on iron, nickel, and cobalt, were used as model materials. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was used to determine their static oxidation rates at elevated temperature (850 degrees C). A micro-abrasion, ball-cratering technique was used to measure oxide layer thickness and to supplement the TGA results. By using taper-sectioning techniques and energy-dispersive elemental mapping, a comparison was made between oxide compositions grown on non-damaged surfaces and oxides that formed on grooves produced by a diamond stylus. Microindentation and scratch hardness data revealed the effects of high-temperature exposure on both the substrate hardness and the nature of oxide scale disruption. There were significant differences in elemental distribution between statically formed oxides and those that formed on scratched regions. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Laser engineered net shaping (LENS) is an additive manufacturing process that presents a promising method of creating or repairing metal parts not previously feasible with traditional manufacturing methods. The LENS process involves the directed deposition of metal via a laser power source and a spray of metal powder co-located to create and feed a molten pool (also referred to generically as Directed Energy Deposition, DED). DED technologies are being developed for use in prototyping, repair, and manufacturing across a wide variety of materials including stainless steel, titanium, tungsten carbide cobalt, aluminum, and nickel based superalloys. However, barriers to the successful production and qualification of LENS produced or repaired parts remain. This work proposes a finite element (FE) analysis methodology capable of simulating the LENS process at the continuum length scale (i.e. part length scale). This method incorporates an element activation scheme wherein only elements that exceed the material melt temperature during laser heating are activated and carried through to subsequent analysis steps. Following the initial element activation calculation, newly deposited, or activated elements and the associated geometry, are carried through to thermal and mechanical analyses to calculate heat flow due to radiation, convection, and conduction as well as stresses and displacements. The final aim of this work is to develop a validated LENS process simulation capability that can accurately predict temperature history, final part shape, distribution of strength, microstructural properties, and residual stresses based on LENS process parameters.

TI ALCHEMI studies of site occupancies in Cr-, Ni-, and Fe-substituted
   manganese cobaltite spinels
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB The effects of Cr, Ni, and Fe substitution into manganese cobaltite (MCO) spinels are of great interest due to the roles that the diffusion of these cations play in reaction layer development during high temperature exposure of MCO-coated alloys. Here we report a study on a series of model Cr-, Ni-, and Fe-substituted MCO spinel ceramics produced by consolidation of combustion-synthesized oxide powders. The cation site occupancies in these samples have been studied by X-ray spectrometry-based Atom Location by CHanneling Enhanced MIcroanalysis (ALCHEMI) experiments in the transmission electron microscope, with the data being analyzed using the ordering tie-line approach. In Cr-substituted samples, the Cr ions lie on the octahedral B sites and the Co ions reside on the tetrahedral A sites with Mn occupying the remaining sites. In Ni-substituted samples, all of the Ni ions occupy the B sites and the Co and Mn ions tend to lie on A and B sites, respectively. In contrast to the Cr-substituted samples, there is some mixing of the Co and Mn ions on the two types of sites at lower Ni contents. In Fe-substituted samples with lower Fe contents, all of the Mn ions occupy the B sites, roughly equal proportions of Fe ions occupy the A and B sites, and Co ions fill the remaining sites. With increasing Fe content, the degree of order decreases which ultimately results in the High Fe sample exhibiting no channeling evidence for preferred site occupation. These ALCHEMI data could provide a useful insight into the role of cation sub-lattice site preference in the formation of reaction layers in MCO-coated stainless steels and superalloys.

TI Strain-induced martensitic transformation near twin boundaries in a
   biomedical Co-Cr-Mo alloy with negative stacking fault energy
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB Biomedical Co-Cr-Mo (CCM) alloys have been commonly used for artificial hip and knee joint prostheses, but a need to improve their biomedical inertness and wear resistance has become widely recognized. The mechanical behavior of CCM alloys is dominated by strain-induced martensitic transformation (SIMT), which causes crack initiation during plastic deformation but dramatically enhances the wear resistance in practical use. To develop more reliable CCM alloys it is essential to clarify the factors affecting the occurrence of SIMT. In the present study we have focused on the effect of annealing twin boundaries (ATBs) on SIMT behavior. We have analyzed in detail the substructures near a parallel pair of ATBs after deformation under a stress preferential for slip parallel to the ATBs. Preferential formation of epsilon-hexagonal close-packed (HCP) phase at ATBs in metastable gamma-face-centered cubic (FCC) phase was found by both scanning electron microscopy with electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) analysis and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). High resolution TEM images indicated that thickening of the epsilon-HCP phase does not proceed regularly on every second atomic plane, which would form perfect epsilon-phase HCP structure, but irregularly leaving a high density of stacking faults. Furthermore, the thickness of the epsilon-HCP phase was found to be different at ATBs on the two sides of the twin. The difference was attributed to the internal stress due to strain incompatibility at the ATBs on the basis of residual stress analysis by the EBSD Wilkinson method and phase-field simulation of solute segregation at ATBs.

TI Microstructure assessment at high temperature in NiCoCrAlY overlay
   coating obtained by laser metal deposition
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY-JMR&T
AB Laser metal deposition (LMD) and laser cladding (LC) could be innovative methods to the current thermal spray techniques for obtaining dense and high-quality bond coats with nickel and cobalt based superalloys in thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) systems. The microstructural evolution of the coatings when is subjected to high temperatures allows us to evaluate their oxidation behavior and integrity in the time, and is especially important in the development of bond coats for new TBCs systems. In this work, the microstructural evolution of a dense NiCoCrAlY overlay coating obtained by coaxial laser cladding and subjected to isothermal oxidation tests at 1100 degrees C up to 200 h was evaluated. The initial coating microstructure is composed of a beta-NiAl phase within the gamma-Ni matrix phase, and some Y inclusions, confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). At high temperature, the thermally-grown oxides (TGO) protect the underlying coating and substrate from oxidation, modifying the initial microstructure of the coating. The formation, morphology and evolution of oxides alpha-Al2O3, Y2O3, YA1O(3) and (Ni,Co)(AlCr2)(2) O-4-type spinel oxides on the cross section of the oxidized coating on different oxidation stages were evaluated using focused ion beam (FIB) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), and indexed by XRD and TEM. After oxidation tests, no cracks or spallation on oxidized sample for NiCoCrAlY coating were observed, and the formation of Y-Al oxides in TGO scale are strongly dependent on the initial Y distribution of as-built condition in the coating.

SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB We characterized the microstructural features and mechanical performance of a model Co-5.6Al-5.8W-6.6Ti-0.12B (at.%) alloy consisting of gamma(L1(2))-precipitates in a gamma(f.c.c.)-matrix. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to follow the isothermal aging of the micro-structure at 900 and 1000 degrees C for 256 h, and 950 degrees C for 1000 h. The compositions of the gamma'(L1(2))-precipitates and gamma(f.c.c.)-matrix were evaluated by atom-probe tomography (APT) for solution-treated and air-cooled conditions, as well as in specimens aged at 950 degrees C for 16 and 100 h. Boron was shown to partition preferentially to the gamma'(L1(2))-precipitates, and profiles taken across the gamma(f.c.c.)-matrix channels in both aged specimens revealed confined segregation of A1 at one of the two gamma(f.c.c.)/gamma'(L1(2)) heterophase interfaces. After aging at 950 degrees C for 16 h, Co-5.6Al-5.8W-6.6Ti-0.12B (at.%) exhibited anomalous flow-strength behavior in the range 625-900 degrees C with a peak yield stress of 822 MPa between 800 and 825 degrees C. Compressive creep tests performed at 850 degrees C demonstrated a creep strength comparable to archival literature results for Co-9Al-9W-0.12B (at.%), despite a smaller gamma'(L1(2))-volume fraction and lack of strengthening borides along the grain boundaries (GBs). The activation energy for creep in the temperature range 800-900 degrees C was 606 kJ mol(-1). The post-creep microstructure consists of rafted gamma'(L1(2))-precipitates perpendicular to the compression axis, consistent with the positive gamma(f.c.c.)/gamma'(L1(2)) lattice parameter misfit character of this class of alloys. Creep failure could occur due to GB embrittlement caused by deleterious Ti-rich (L2(1) or B2) and D0(19) phases formed at the GBs during creep. (C) 2019 Acta Materialia Inc.

AB It has been investigated the Ni-Co alloys (obtained from powder 0.1...0.3 mm under hot gaseous (in argon) isostatic pressure (up to 300 MPa) (Ni60Co15Cr8W8Al2Mo3) (Firth Rixon Metal Ltd, Sheffield) and deformed (obtained by vacuum induced remealting) materials (Ni62Cr14Co10Mo5Nb3Al3Ti3) for gaseous turbine discs. Investigation has performed in the range of temperature 25...800 degrees C and hydrogen pressure up to 70 MPa. By the 3D visualization of crack morphology it has been discovered the structure of fatigue crack surface and established the refer points on crack path, including the boundary between the matrix and intermetallic particles (400x200 mu m), crack opening, structural elements distributions on the surface for selection of next local areas for more precision fracture surface and TEM examinations. Hydrogen influence on cyclic crack resistance parameters appears in the decreasing of loading cycles number (with amplitudes 15 MPa) in hydrogenated specimens of both alloys and increase with hydrogen concentration. At the highest hydrogen saturation regimes of Ni60Co15Cr8W8Al2Mo3 alloy (800 degrees C, 35 MPa H-2, 36 hours, C-H = 32.7 ppm) number of cycles, which necessary for crack initiation is 3 times less in comparison with specimen in initial state. At crack initiation step in hydrogenated Ni56Cr14Co15Mo5Al3Ti3 alloy it has been established that before intermetallic inclusion (400x200 mu m) local stresses increased, after its passing - has decreased. By fracture surface investigation it has been found the micro cracks up to 40 mu m. Thin structure of heat resistant superalloys has characterises by disperse phase agglomeration with dimensions from 5 to 30 nm and crack propagation has a jumping character with no less then 50...70 nm steps.

SO CALPHAD-COMPUTER COUPLING OF PHASE DIAGRAMS AND THERMOCHEMISTRY
AB Literature data about phase equilibria and thermodynamics of the Co-Ni, Co-Ti, Ni-Ti and Co-Ni-Ti systems have been reviewed and critically assessed. Co-Ni-Ti phase equilibria are not completely known and contradictory results have been reported, especially about existence, stability range and phase relations of the Ti(Co,Ni)(3) ternary phase in the region at x(Ti) < 0.5. Then the 900 degrees C isothermal section in the mentioned composition range has been experimentally investigated by means of optical and electron microscopy, electron probe micro-analysis and powder X-ray diffraction. Moreover the existence of the Ti (Co,Ni)(3) phase has been confirmed and its stability checked, at least down to 500 degrees C. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Effect of surface oxidation on corrosion mechanism of

SO CORROSION ENGINEERING SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB In this paper, the effect of surface oxidation on corrosion behaviour of Co-20.8Ni-6Al-10Cu-11Fe alloy in molten cryolite is investigated. The samples were produced by casting and then were oxidised at 1000 degrees C for 10, 30 and 70 h respectively. The oxide layers were studied by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). To determine the corrosion behaviour of the oxidised samples, they were exposed to molten cryolite at 930 degrees C for 20 h. After corrosion, the samples were studied by SEM. The results showed that all the samples corroded, but the sample oxidised for 70 h, was more stable than the other and the other one that oxidised for 10 h, corroded severely.

SO INTERMETALLICS
AB The study on the formation and growth of topological close packed (TCP) compounds is important to understand the performance of turbine blades in jet engine applications. These deleterious phases grow mainly by diffusion process in the superalloy substrate. Significant volume change was found because of growth of the p phase in Co-Mo system. Growth kinetics of this phase and different diffusion parameters, like interdiffusion, intrinsic and tracer diffusion coefficients are calculated. Further the activation energy, which provides an idea about the mechanism, is determined. Moreover, the interdiffusion coefficient in Co(Mo) solid solution and impurity diffusion coefficient of Mo in Co are determined. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI The effect of Ni:Co ratio on the elemental phase partitioning in
   gamma-gamma ' Ni-Co-Al-Ti-Cr alloys
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB Atom probe tomography has been used to characterise the effect of varying Ni:Co ratio on elemental phase partitioning at 800 degrees C in gamma-gamma' alloys derived from the Ni-Co-Al-Ti-Cr system. In all alloys tested, Al and Ti were found to partition preferentially to the gamma' phase, whereas Co and Cr partitioned preferentially to the y phase. However, above a critical Co content (-19 at.%), the extent of partitioning of Al and Ti to the gamma' phase reduced. Conversely, Cr partitioned more strongly to the y phase with Co additions of up to 19 at.%, above which this preferential segregation was less pronounced. This non-monotonic trend of elemental partitioning behaviour with increasing Co concentration was attributed to a transition in the chemistry of the L1(2) gamma' phase from Ni-3(Ti, Al) to (Ni, Co)(3)(Ti, Al) and thus to a change in its solute solubility.

TI High temperature oxidation behaviour of Ni-Fe-Co anodes for aluminium
   electrolysis
SO CORROSION SCIENCE
AB The oxidation behaviour of ternary NixFeyCoz alloys (where x/y (wt) = 1 and 1.85: z = 0, 10, 30 and 50 wt.%) was studied in air at 800 degrees C. Alloys were found to follow complex oxidation kinetics, with the highest oxidation rates observed for alloys having 50 wt.% Co. Significant improvements in oxidation resistance were achieved by addition of 10 and 30 wt.% Co to the Ni-Fe system. The decrease in oxidation rate was associated with suppression of Fe2O3 formation in preference for (Co,Ni)(x)Fe3-xO4 growth. The results were discussed in light of the materials requirements for inert anodes for aluminium electrolysis. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Thermodynamic re-assessment of the Al-Co-W system
SO CALPHAD-COMPUTER COUPLING OF PHASE DIAGRAMS AND THERMOCHEMISTRY
AB The Al-Co-W system and its binary sub-systems Al-Co, Al-W and Co-W were critically reviewed. The thermodynamic description of the Al-Co-W system including all three binaries was developed considering thermodynamic and constitutional data of the systems. Results from density functional theory calculations were employed to improve reliability of the descriptions. The Gibbs energy for the thermal vacancy (G(va)) in the BCC_A2 phase is discussed. The revised descriptions obtained for the Al-W and Co-W systems describe the thermodynamic and phase equilibrium data well and are free of undesired artefacts for temperatures below 6000 K. The ordered gamma' phase of the Al-Co-W system is described as a metastable phase in the entire temperature range. The calculated Gibbs energy of the gamma' is only slightly above that of the equilibrium state, which indicates that there is good possibility of stabilizing the gamma' phase with the addition of gamma'-stabilizing elements, such as Ti, Ta, Hf, Nb and Ni.

CL CHAMPION, PA
AB Wrought cobalt-base superalloys are used extensively in gas turbine engines because of their excellent high-temperature creep and fatigue strengths and resistance to hot corrosion attack. In addition, the unique character of the oxide scales that form on some of the alloys provides outstanding resistance to high-temperature sliding wear. This article provides a review of the evolutionary development of wrought cobalt-base alloys in terms of alloy design and physical metallurgy. The topics include solid-solution strengthening, carbide precipitation characteristics, and attempts to introduce age hardening. The use of PHACOMP to enhance thermal stability characteristics and,the incorporation of rare-earth elements to improve oxidation resistance is also reviewed and discussed. The further development of cobalt-base superalloys has been severely hampered by past political events, which have accentuated the strategic vulnerability of cobalt as a base or as an alloying element. Consequently, alternative alloys have been developed that use little or no cobalt. One such alternative, Haynes(R) 230(TM) alloy, is discussed briefly.

TI Friction and wear characterization of some cobalt- and iron-based
   superalloys in zinc alloy baths
SO WEAR
AB A full-journal submerged bearing test rig was built to evaluate the friction and wear behavior of materials in zinc alloy baths. Some cobalt- and iron-based superalloys were tested using this rig at conditions similar to those of a continuous galvanizing operation (load and bath chemistry). Metallographic and chemical analyses were conducted on tested samples to characterize the wear. It was found that a commonly used cobalt-based material (Stellite #6) not only suffered considerable wear but also reacted with zinc baths to form intermetallic compounds. Other cobalt- and iron-based superalloys appeared to have negligible reaction with the zinc baths in the short-term tests, but cracks developed in the sub-surface, suggesting that the materials mainly experienced surface fatigue wear. The commonly used cobalt-based superalloy mostly experienced abrasive wear. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Microstructural Evolution and High Strain Rate Mechanical Property of

SO SAINS MALAYSIANA
AB The high strain rate properties and microstructure observations of cobalt base superalloyd contains 0.9% Ti were investigated using Hopkinson bar. These cobalt base superalloys are tested at strain rates of 2x10(3), 3x10(3) and 4x10(3) s(-1) and at different temperatures (25, 500 and 900 degrees C), respectively. It is found that the stress flow and strain rate sensitivity increases with increasing strain rate but decrease with increasing temperature. The microstructure observations confirm that the high strain rate mechanical behavior of the cobalt base superalloys specimens are directly related to the effects of the strain rate, temperature and the evolution of the microstructural texture. The strengthening mechanism in cobalt base superalloys is the multiplication of dislocation. The dislocation density increases with increasing strain rate but decrease with increasing temperature.

AB The influence of titanium element, strain rate and tested temperatures on the mechanical properties and microstructural characteristics will be investigated in this paper. These cobalt-based superalloys are tested using material testing system (MTS) at strain rates of 10(-3), 10(-2) and 10(-1) s(-1) and at temperatures of 700, 500 and 25 degrees C, respectively. It is found that the flow stress increases with increasing strain rate and Ti, but decreases with increasing temperature. Furthermore, the strain rate sensitivity increases with increasing strain rate, but decreases with increasing temperature. The microstructural observations confirm that the mechanical response of the cobalt superalloy specimens is directly related to the effects of the titanium contents, strain rate and temperature on the evolution of the microstructure. It can be observed that the strengthening effect in cobalt-based superalloys is a result primarily of dislocation multiplication. The dislocation density increases with increasing strain rate, but decreases with increasing temperature.

TI Effect of Fe addition on microstructures and mechanical properties of
   Ni- and C-free Co-Cr-Mo alloys
SO MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS
AB A series of Co-Cr-Mo alloys with Fe contents ranging from 5 to 20 mass% were prepared in order to study the effect of Fe addition on the microstructures and mechanical properties (tensile strength, yield strength, elongation, and Rockwell C scale hardness) of Ni- and C-free Co-Cr-Mo alloys. Fe was added with the composition of Co-29Cr-6Mo-xFe (where x = 0, 5, 10, and 20). Alloys were heat-treated at 1230 degrees C for 3 h and 1250 degrees C for 5 h. These heat treatment conditions were decided as considering pre-heat treatment followed by hot-forging process. An optical microscope and an XRD were used to determine the microstructure and identify the crystal structure. The volume ratio of gamma phase to epsilon phase increases not only with heat treatment temperature and time but also with Fe content. The tensile strength, yield strength, and elongation are significantly improved by Fe addition. However, the tendency toward a phase formation becomes higher as the Fe content increases, causing a deterioration of mechanical properties. From the viewpoint of mechanical properties, the amount of Fe addition should be less than 10 mass% in pre-heated condition of Co-29Cr-6Mo alloys.

TI A two-stage predicting model for gamma ' solvus temperature of
   L1(2)-strengthened Co-base superalloys based on machine learning
SO INTERMETALLICS
AB As one of the candidate materials of the next generation aircraft engines, L1(2)-strengthened Co-base superalloys have drawn lots of attentions. However, Co-base superalloys have some disadvantages, such as gamma ' precipitates in the superalloys are metastable. Moreover, improving this superalloy through traditional experimental approaches is extremely costly and inefficient. Thus, it is necessary to develop a new approach that could make rapid and accurate predictions of the properties of the L1(2)-strengthened Co-base superalloys. In this study, the gamma ' solvus temperature, which is the basic property of L1(2)-strengthened Co-base superalloys, is predicted based on our two-stage approach. Firstly, the existence of the gamma ' precipitates are predicted. And then, the solvus temperatures of the candidates which are predicted to have gamma ' precipitates are calculated by our models. A new superalloy with high gamma ' precipitates solvus temperature is designed successfully with the help of our approach. The time cost of this approach is less than that of the traditional experimental approach. This approach could also be used to discover L1(2)-strengthened Co-base superalloys with other desired properties.

   CLASSES
SE Woodhead Publishing in Materials
AB This chapter focuses on the hydrogen environment embrittlement (HEE) effects for three main classes of superalloys known as the nickel-based, cobalt-based and iron-based superalloys. For many superalloys, the HEE effects can occur over a much wider range of temperatures, with significant hydrogen embrittlement still evident at substantially higher temperatures than near room temperature. A comprehensive review of experimental data for HEE index is given, which is a useful concept to qualitatively evaluate the severity of hydrogen embrittlement prior to performing detailed material and fracture analysis for a specific hydrogen environment application. High pressure and temperature effects of hydrogen gas on superalloy properties such as tensile ductility, fracture, low cycle and high cycle fatigue, cyclic crack growth rate, and creep stress rupture have been analyzed with respect to the behavior trends established from the HEE index values. The compositional effects of nickel for hydrogen embrittlement of many Fe-Ni-Cr-based superalloys are also presented.

AB A new method for diffusion bonding nickel base and cobalt base superalloys has been developed, which is based on non-chemical oxide removal before the bonding process. Using this method, diffusion bonds were produced in nickel base and cobalt base superalloys with 'virtually invisible' bond interfaces and compositions very close to the bulk alloys. The bonding time required is about 1 h and the results of severe mechanical tests of the bonded samples, including directionally solidified (DS), single crystal and dissimilar superalloys, are very promising. The new oxide removal method is very rapid, does not require the use of any sophisticated equipment and is not a costly process. The high temperature properties of bonded samples are currently being investigated. European and USA patents have been applied for and the details of this new method are to be published in the future.

SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Insight in phase equilibria is very valuable for the design of Co-based superalloys that have the potential of 50 degrees C higher temperature capability than Ni-based superalloys. The Co-rich part of the Co-Al-X (X = W, Mo, Nb, Ni, Ta) ternary systems is especially important and was thus investigated using two sets of diffusion multiples (Ni-Co-CoAl-Cr-Mo-Nb-Ta-Wand Ni-Co-NiAl-Si-Zr). Isothermal sections of the Co-Al-W and Co-Al-Nb systems at 900 degrees C as well as the Co-Al-Mo, Co-Al-Ni and Co-Al-Ta systems at both 900 degrees C and 800 degrees C were constructed from the results of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electron probe microanalysis (EPMA). The data can be used as experimental input to future thermodynamic assessments of the Co-Al-X ternary systems in order to improve the relevant thermodynamic databases for the design and development of Co-based superalloys.

AB A novel method for diffusion bonding metallic alloys with stable surface oxide films (e.g. nickel and cobalt base superalloys and aluminium. alloys) has been developed. The stable oxides on the faying surfaces of these alloys are replaced, prior to the bonding process, with a very thin metallic layer and/or less stable oxides, using a proprietary non-chemical oxide removal method based on the use of gallium. This new method is very rapid and neither requires the use of any sophisticated equipment nor is a costly process. Bonding is then readily achieved by either solid-state or transient-liquid-phase (TLP) diffusion bonding. Using this method, bonds in nickel-base and cobalt-base superalloys with "virtually invisible" bond interfaces and bonds in aluminium alloys with strengths as high as those of the parent alloys can be produced.

AB In the present study, three superalloys viz. Superni 718, Superni 600 and Superco 605 were hung inside the secondary chamber of actual medical waste incinerator where the temperature is more than 1050 degrees C. Burning of medical waste produces very corrosive environment at high temperature which can degrade the components of construction. Hence the three superalloys were kept for 1000 h inside the chamber. Corrosion rate has been calculated in mpy. Corrosion products so produced were characterized using SEM/EDS and XRD technique. It was observed that both the Nickel based superalloys showed better corrosion resistance than the cobalt based superalloy under the given environment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The phase equilibrium and the precipitation behavior of the gamma' phase in the Co-Al-W-Ni-Cr superalloys were studied by thermodynamic method. The phase equilibrium of the Co-Al-W-15Ni-5Cr alloy at 900 degrees C was calculated, and it was found that there were a gamma' single-phase region and a gamma+gamma' two-phase region. The effects of Al/W ratio on the precipitation of the gamma' phase were studied, and it was clear that higher mole fraction of the gamma' phase can be obtained with the Al/W ratio of 2.5. The stability of the gamma' phase can be improved by adding of Ni, as well as the servicing temperature of the Co-Al-W based superalloys. The results obtained in this work can be used for the developing of the new-type Co-based superalloys.

AB In order to investigate the influence of Co on creep deformation anisotropy, some Ni-base single crystal superalloys have been creep tested at 800 degrees C and 735 MPa. It is found that, although Go-containing alloys have higher creep resistance when the tensile direction is within 5 degrees of (100), they are much more sensitive to tensile orientation than Go-free alloys, which have similar creep rupture lives for tensile orientations within 25 degrees of (100). It is revealed that for Co-containing alloys the (111)(112) slip system is operative during first-stage creep, when heterogeneous deformation occurs. Also, the degree of heterogeneous deformation correlates very well with creep rupture lives. It may thus be concluded that Co is not essential in improving creep rupture properties of Ni-base superalloys. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science S.A.

Furthermore, impurities (oxides of Al, Zr, Hf, Cr etc.) have been identified inside the shrinkage cavities of feed ingots and castings. Significant similarities has been observed between impurities found in ingots, ATD test samples and finished castings. It has been demonstrated that ATD analysis of samples taken from different parts of feed ingot can be effective method of metallurgical quality assessment for these ingots.

TI On the role of processing parameters in sintered new Co-based (W,Al)
   alloys
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB The demand for enhanced material performance and efficiency in high-temperature applications has motivated the development of novel Co-based superalloys. Co-Al-W-based superalloys with the gamma/gamma' structure have suitable properties for use at high temperature and are good candidates for replacing Ni-based superalloys in some applications. The current generation of Co-Al-W-based alloys has superior wear, corrosion, and oxidation resistance. The poor precipitation strengthening of these alloys compared to that of Ni-based superalloys can be overcome by designing the alloying system to promote gamma'-Co-3(Al, W) precipitation. In this work, the compositions of the selected Co-Al-W-based alloys were chosen because they improve the precipitation strengthening of the alloys. Starting from powders, the materials were fabricated by mechanical alloying (MA) and subsequently consolidated by field assisted hot pressing (FAHP). The prepared Co-Al-W superalloys have a large amount of well-dispersed nanoprecipitates in their microstructures and have nearly full density. The effects of the MA and consolidation process (FAHP) conditions on the microstructures and mechanical properties of selected samples are determined by comparing the samples. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB The phase stability of intermetallic compounds of Co(3)X has been discussed with a focus on the gamma' phase of Co(3)Al, Co(3)W and Co(3)(Al, W) with the L1(2) Structure. The critical temperatures of the gamma' phase of Co(3)Al, Co(3)W and Co(3)(Al, W) compounds are estimated to be about 870 degrees C, 980 degrees C and 1076 degrees C, respectively. The effect of alloying elements on the Co-Al-W -base alloys was found to be very similar to that of Ni-base superalloys, where Ti, Ta, Nb and V are the gamma' stabilizing elements, while Mn, Fe and Cr are the gamma forming elements. The mechanical properties of Co-Al-W-base alloys were also found to be similar to those of Ni-base alloys. In particular, the flow strengths of Co-Al-W-base alloys at temperatures above 800 degrees C were comparable or higher than those of Ni-base superalloys, which implies that the Co-base superalloys strengthened by the gamma' phase have great potential as a new type of high-temperature alloys.

SO PHYSICS OF METALS AND METALLOGRAPHY
AB In this article, we give a preferential regime of selective laser melting for the production of parts from a cobalt superalloy using a PTK-PS domestic machine, which can find application upon the production of components from various superalloys in the aviation and atomic industry and in the automobile industry. We have investigated the phase composition and determined the physicomechanical properties of the samples prepared under the preferential regime of selective laser melting. It has been established that the structure of the alloy obtained by selective laser melting consists of two supersaturated solid solutions based on the low-temperature hexagonal and high-temperature cubic cobalt modifications, which leads to an increase in the strength characteristics of the samples in comparison with the cast samples.

AB Experiments and thermodynamic calculations were performed on five cobalt-base superalloys containing tantalum carbide and chromium carbides in order to evaluate the accuracy of thermodynamic calculations for this alloy family. The studied quantities were the solidus temperature and the phase fractions of the different carbides observed after a long exposure time at different high temperatures. The predicted and observed phases are in good agreement. However the measured phase fractions and melting temperatures were sometimes higher than the calculated values. The disagreement in the phase fractions can be attributed to the fact that surface fractions and volume fractions are not necessarily equal. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Superalloys, used for turbine blades and jet engines for airplanes, have low heat conduction and high strength at elevated temperature. These properties make it very difficult to obtain effective grinding processes with high accuracy. Superalloys with fine performance under high temperature circumstances attract great attention to be used as the material for turbine blades. It has been expected to establish reliable efficient grinding of superalloys at the final grinding process.
   In this study, the influence of wheel wear, grinding ratio, and surface roughness, with the grinding process of superalloys, using metal bonded CBN wheel were carefully observed. Since superalloys have lower heat conduction and they cause a severe wheel wear, which leads to low grinding ratio. However, the high grinding ratio of about 800 and the stable figure of surface roughness of Rz=2 mu m were obtained when Co-base PWA647 and X45 were ground by using metal-bonded CBN wheel.
   Consequently, the Co-base superalloys perform rather well producing finer grinding process than the intensive Ni-base or Fe-base superalloys.

SO METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND
   MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB High-temperature oxidation resistance of the superalloys can be greatly increased by plasma-sprayed coatings, and this is a growing industry of considerable economic importance. The purpose of these coatings is to form long-lasting oxidation protective scales. In the current investigation, Stellite-6 coatings were deposited on two Ni-base superalloys, Superni 601 and Superni 718, and one Fe-base superalloy, Superfer 800H, by a shrouded plasma spray process. Oxidation studies were conducted on the coated superalloys in air at 900 C under cyclic conditions for 50 cycles. Each cycle consisted of 1 hour heating followed by 20 minutes of cooling in air. The thermogravimetric technique was used to approximate the kinetics of oxidation. All of the coated superalloys nearly followed the parabolic rate law of oxidation. X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray (SEM/EDAX), and electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) techniques were used to analyze the oxidation products. The Stellite-6 coating was found to be successful in maintaining its continuous surface contact with the superalloy substrates in all cases. The oxide scales formed on the oxidized coated superalloys were found to be intact and spallation free. The main phases analyzed for the coated superalloys were oxides of cobalt and chromium and spinel of cobalt and chromium, which are suggested to be useful for developing oxidation resistance at high temperatures.

SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB A Co-based superalloy, Co-9Al-9W (at%), was processed by mechanical alloying by high-energy milling of elemental powders and consolidated by field assisted hot pressing (FAHP). The milled powder particles mainly consist of undissolved bcc-W as well as WC and an Al and W rich fcc-gamma Co solid solution. After consolidation and heat treatment a fine grained microstructure with a high fraction of carbides and a gamma/gamma' microstructure was obtained. The compressive yield strength at room temperature was found to be 45% higher than that of previously reported results for Co-based superalloys. A similar level of strength was found at 700 degrees C. These extraordinary properties can be explained due to the multitude of hardening mechanisms that sintered Co-based superalloys possess: gamma' precipitation, carbide formation and the ultra-fine se-grain size promoted by the fast consolidation technique.

AB Y-Ce-Co-modified aluminide coating on nickel base superalloys was prepared by pack cementation method. The microstructure and hot corrosion behavior of the coating were investigated. The results indicate that Y-Ce-Co-modified aluminide coating has a mass gain of only 0.32 mg/cm(2) after hot corrosion at 1173 k for 100 h. The coating exhibits superior hot corrosion resistance to they-Co-modified and Co-modified aluminide coatings. The improved hot corrosion resistance of the Y-Ce-Co-modified aluminide coating is mainly attributed to the synergistic effect of Y and Ce. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A set of advanced single crystalline gamma' strengthened Co-base superalloys with at least nine alloying elements (Co, Ni, Al, W, Ti, Ta, Cr, Si, Hf, Re) has been developed and investigated. The objective was to generate multinary Co-base superalloys with significantly improved properties compared to the original Co-Al-W-based alloys. All alloys show the typical gamma/gamma' two-phase microstructure. A gamma' solvus temperature up to 1174 degrees C and gamma' volume fractions between 40 and 60 pct at 1050 degrees C could be achieved, which is significantly higher compared to most other Co-Al-W-based superalloys. However, higher contents of Ti, Ta, and the addition of Re decrease the long-term stability. Atom probe tomography revealed that Re does not partition to the gamma phase as strongly as in Ni-base superalloys. Compression creep properties were investigated at 1050 degrees C and 125 MPa in < 001 > direction. The creep resistance is close to that of first generation Ni-base superalloys. The creep mechanisms of the Re-containing alloy was further investigated and it was found that the deformation is located preferentially in the gamma channels although some precipitates are sheared during early stages of creep. The addition of Re did not improve the mechanical properties and is therefore not considered as a crucial element in the design of future Co-base superalloys for high temperature applications. Thermodynamic calculations describe well how the alloying elements influence the transformation temperatures although there is still an offset in the actual values. Furthermore, a full set of elastic constants of one of the multinary alloys is presented, showing increased elastic stiffness leading to a higher Young's modulus for the investigated alloy, compared to conventional Ni-base superalloys. The oxidation resistance is significantly improved compared to the ternary Co-Al-W compound. A complete thermal barrier coating system was applied successfully.

AB The evolution of a eta phase (Ni(3)Ti) in Ni-Co base superalloys with different Co and Ti content has been investigated. The results showed that the eta phase existed in the samples with 23.1 wt.%Co and 5.4 wt.%Ti (TMW-3) and also the samples with 28.6 wt.% Co and 7.4 wt.%Ti (TMW-5) heat-treated at the temperature ranges of 1100-1140 degrees C, but not in the samples with 26.3 wt.%Co and 6.0 wt.%Ti (TMW-4). Even in TMW-3 and TMW-5, higher solution temperature (1180 degrees C) can fully reduce the formation of the eta phase. The evolution of the eta phase is complicated and may be related to the Ti content, Ti/Al ratio and alloy's composition. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   tomography and first-principles calculations
SO PHILOSOPHICAL MAGAZINE
AB The topologically close-packed phase formation is heavily influenced by the concentrations of Co, Ru, and Cr in Ni-based superaloys. For this purpose, we investigate the partitioning behaviour and site preference of these additions in the model Ni-Al-X single crystal superalloys by atom probe tomography and first-principles calculations. Compared with the commercial multicomponent superalloys, Co and Ru still strongly partition to the gamma phase, while Cr weakly partitions to the gamma phase in the ternary model alloys. Based on the gamma' phase composition analyses, Ru and Cr atoms preferentially substitute for the Al sublattice sites, whereas Co atoms substitute at both Al and Ni sublattice sites in the ordered gamma'-Ni3Al phase. First-principles calculations on the substitutional formation energies at 0 K were performed to understand the site preference, and the partitioning coefficient of additions was given in a quantitative model. The partitioning behaviour and site preference of Co, Ru, and Cr by theoretical calculations are consistent with the experimental results.

   by DTA analysis
SO JOURNAL OF THERMAL ANALYSIS AND CALORIMETRY
AB The gamma-gamma' Co-based superalloys are newly developed class of refractory alloys which may replace commercial Ni-based superalloys owing to their favorable properties at high temperature. In case of new Co-based superalloys, the heat treatment aims to obtain microstructure composed of appropriate volume fraction of small cuboidal gamma'-Co-3(Al, W) precipitates within the gamma-Co matrix. However, due to a high tendency to interdendritic segregations of alloying elements, the alloys based on Co-Al-W system should be normally homogenized before further steps of heat treatment (solutionizing and aging). In this study, thermal analysis was applied for determination of temperature range for primary heat treatment of the Co-9Al-9W (at.%). The differential thermal analysis (DTA) measurements were carried out on the thermal analyzer NETZSCH STA 449 F3 Jupiter. On the base of obtained results, respectively, solvus of gamma' phase and solidus temperatures were determined, as well as the thermal range of Co3W (DO19) phase precipitation. As a consequence, the heat treatment without homogenizing (only solution and aging) was proposed as a most suitable way to obtain beneficial microstructure.

SO CORROSION SCIENCE
AB Oxidation mechanisms in polycrystalline Co-Ni-Cr-Al-W-Ta alloys were investigated using O-16/O-18 isotopic tracer analysis in the focused ion-beam secondary ion mass spectrometer (FIB-SIMS). It was found that Al additions favour the formation of a continuous alumina-rich layer, that Cr indirectly improved oxidation resistance and that increasing the Co fraction resulted in poorer oxidation performance. In the alloy containing 15 at.% Cr and 10 at.% Al, the outer scale formed after 200h oxidation at 800 degrees C comprised oxides less than 1 mu m thick. It is concluded that protective oxide scales can be formed in Co-Ni base superalloys. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

With the decrease of SFE and strain rate, the formation of NGs will be promoted obviously, leading to the negative strain rate sensitivity of compressive stress in superalloys. The NGs, generated through the fragmentation of subgrains by microtwins, may become a candidate choice for dynamically strengthening superalloys at high temperature. (C) 2017 Acta Materialia Inc.

SO INTERMETALLICS
AB Phase stability information regarding the formation of the topologically close packed (TCP) phases is critical for the design of advanced Ni-based and Co-based superalloys that contain high concentrations of refractory elements. Isothermal sections of the Co-Ni-W, Co-Ni-Mo, Co-Ni-Nb and Co-Ni-Ta systems at both 900 degrees C and 800 degrees C were constructed for the first time from electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) measurements on two Co-CoAl-Cr-Mo-Ni-Nb-Ta-W diffusion multiples. The new data will serve as experimental input to future thermodynamic assessments of the Co-Ni-X ternary systems in order to improve the thermodynamic databases for the design and development of advanced Ni-based and Co-based superalloys.

SO CORROSION SCIENCE
AB The role of base element (Co or Ni) in gamma'-strengthened single-crystalline superalloys was elucidated in the present study. Reaction kinetics during oxidation at 900 degrees C were assessed by thermogravimetry and measurements of individual layer thicknesses in the multilayered oxide scales. The development of diffusion-limiting barrier layers as well as the extent of sub-scale phase transitions could be directly correlated to the Co/Ni ratio in the alloy. For the first time a surface pretreatment with F was applied to Co-base superalloys. Apparent differences in the efficacy of the halogen effect depending on the Co content in the model alloys were observed.

The combination of excellent mechanical properties, corrosion resistance and bio-compatibility renders these alloys the best material choice for many critical applications. This review describes the results realized through the research in the Department of Materials Science in "Vinca" Institute. The emphasize was given to the relation between the microstructure and mechanical properties of conventionally cast nickel and cobalt-based superalloys, as well as directionally solidified and single crystal castings of nickel-based superalloys. The special attention was paid to the development of vacuum melting and casting technology for processing surgical implants made of a titanium-based alloy.

AB The effect of cobalt on chemical segregation and solution process in three nickel base single crystal superalloys was investigated. Three alloys containing the mass fraction of cobalt of 12% (named Alloy 1), 3% (named Alloy 2) and 0 (named Alloy 3), respectively were studied, in which the contents of other elements were same. The results show that the segregation extent of W, Re, Ta, Al between dendrite and interdendritic region rises with the increase of cobalt content. The incipient melting points decrease by 10 degrees C and 20 degrees C respectively when the content of cobalt increases from 0 through 3% to 12%. During solid solution at 1 340 degrees C, the solid solution of large gamma prime in interdendritic region and the dissolution of eutectic in alloy I become easier than in other two alloys. After heat-treatment at 1 340 degrees C for 8 h, the segregation extent of elements in alloy 1 decreases dramatically, while in alloy 2 and alloy 3, the segregation ratios decrease slowly. It suggests that the higher content of cobalt can accelerate the diffusion process at high temperature.

Examples will focus primarily on alloys 718 and 720, which are iron-nickel and nickel-based alloys, respectively. The availability of a second phase to control grain size is a characteristic of some iron-nickel- and nickel-based superalloys that is not usually available to cobalt-based superalloys; processing with and without the use of a precipitated phase that influences microstructures will be illustrated by the use of these examples.

TI Oxidation and microstructure evolution of cobalt aluminide coatings on
   directionally solidified superalloys during long term exposure at 1000
   degrees C
SO MATERIALS RESEARCH INNOVATIONS
AB Using low pressure chemical vapour deposition, cobalt aluminide coatings were deposited onto directionally solidified Ni based superalloys (DZ466 and DS GTD111). Isothermal oxidation testing of the coated specimens was performed at 1000 degrees C under atmospheric pressure for times up to 2500 h. Oxidation and interdiffusion behaviour of the coating superalloy systems was examined. It was observed that the oxide growth mode of both coating systems conformed to a staged parabolic law, with differences in the transient stage related to the growth of theta-Al2O3. Coating degradation and formation of chromium containing precipitates occurred during exposure because of severe interdiffusion between the coating and superalloy. The composition of the superalloy substrate played an important role in the microstructure evolution of the aluminide coating, and the corresponding mechanism is discussed.

TI Effect of Co on Discontinuous Precipitation Transformation with TCP
   Phase in Ni-based Alloy Containing Re
SO METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND
   MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB The effect of Co on discontinuous precipitation (DP) transformation involving the formation of topologically close-packed (TCP) phase was investigated in three Ni-Cr-Re model alloys containing different levels of Co. One typical TCP phase, sigma, was generated within DP cellular colonies along the migrating grain boundaries in experimental alloys during aging treatment. As a result of the increased solubility of Re in the gamma matrix and enlarged interlamellar spacing of sigma precipitates inside of growing DP colonies, Co addition suppressed the formation of sigma phase and associated DP colonies. This study suggests that Co could potentially serve as a microstructural stabilizer in Re-containing Ni-base superalloys, which provides an alternative method for the composition optimization of superalloys.

TI Microstructural nature and stability of Co-rich TCP phases in
   Ru-containing single crystal superalloys
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Destruction of microstructural stability caused by topologically close-packed (TCP) phase precipitation restricted the industrial application of advanced single crystal superalloys. However, systematic investigations on microstructural nature and evolution of Co-rich TCP phases in Ru-containing single crystal superalloys with high level of Co addition have been rarely reported. In this study, experimental results indicated that the main TCP phase was mu phase after thermal exposure at 950 degrees C for 1000 h, while R phase was the main phase after thermal exposure at 1100 degrees C for 1000 h in the alloys containing high level of Co and different levels of Cr and Mo. The experimental and thermodynamic calculation results showed that R phase was more stable at 1100 degrees C than that of m phase in the experimental alloys. Meanwhile, m phase started to transform to R phase at 1100 degrees C for 50 h, and the stress accelerated the transformation of m phase and R phase during creep test at 1100 degrees C/140 MPa in an alloy containing high levels of Co, Cr and Mo additions. Both R phase and m phase were enriched in Re, W, Mo, Cr and Co, while R phase contained more Cr and m phase was more enriched in Mo. This study contributes to better understand the microstructural evolution of TCP phases at different temperatures and to optimize the alloy design and thermodynamic database of Ru-containing single crystal superalloys with high level of Co addition.

Effect of Y2O3 content in the pack mixture on microstructure and hot corrosion resistance of the coatings was investigated. The results show that with the increase in Y2O3 content, the content of Co in the coatings increases. The mass gain of the coatings with Y2O3 addition of 1, 2 and 3 wt.% is 0.6, 0.55 and 0.42 mg/cm(2) after hot corrosion at 1173 K for 100 h, respectively.

TI Oxidation behavior of Fe-Ni-Co based superalloys and influence of
   yttrium addition
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB The oxidation behavior of three Fe-Co-Ni based superalloys with different yttrium additions were investigated at 650 degrees C in air. The oxidation kinetics of the three alloys follows parabolic law initially, then follows linear law. The oxide scale formed on all three alloys consists mainly of Co dissolved Fe3O4 and partly of FeO and Fe2O3 in which Fe3O4 acts as a protective layer. An yttrium addition into the Fe-Co-Ni based superalloys improves their oxidation resistance by reducing the micro-defects in the scales. Thus, the weight gains of the alloys during the oxidation are reduced, and the transition of parabolic law to linear law is postponed. Pegging was observed on the cross section of alloy with 0.08 wt pet yttrium addition after the oxidation.

AB Co/Si co-doped beta-NiAl coating on nickel based superalloys was prepared using pack cementation method. Microstructure and cyclic oxidation behaviour of the coating were investigated. The weight loss of the coating is less than 3 mg/cm(2) after 3200 cycles at 1050 degrees C. The coating exhibits a good cyclic oxidation resistance. The addition of Si decreases the growth stress in the oxide scale by inhibiting the formation of harmful NiO. The formation of SiO2 particles at the scale/coating interface decreases the growth rate of the Al2O3 scale. Moreover, Si addition promotes the formation of the high Al-content phase beta-NiAl.

SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS RESEARCH
AB The influence of Co content on stacking fault energy (SFE) of the gamma matrix in four Ni-Co base superalloys, including newly developed alloys, has been studied by utilizing high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. The results indicated the SFE was not linear with Co content of the gamma matrix. The lowest SFE could be attained at around 34.0 at.% Co. This effect was attributed to variation of electron holes, saturated Co content in the matrix, and the effect of Co on the partition coefficient of other alloying elements. A high density of twins was related to low SFE and could improve the mechanical properties.

Either Mo or Nb additions at the expense of W reduce alloy density to a similar extent. Increasing Mo substitution significantly decreases the gamma ' volume fraction and results in spherical gamma ' morphology at 750 degrees C, whereas Nb substitution shows opposite effects on the gamma ' volume fraction and morphology. Accordingly, the Mo and Nb additions raise and decrease the microhardness and high-temperature compression strength, respectively. The results can provide reference for the development of Co-based superalloys with low density and high strength.

AB To investigate whether the formation of rafts in Co-base superalloys has a hardening or softening effect, the single crystal deformation behavior was studied in the high temperature/low stress creep regime. The large positive lattice misfit of the investigated Co-base superalloy led to a pronounced directional coarsening of the microstructure normal to the stress axis during compressive creep at 950 degrees C/150 MPa. Two creep minima were observed similar to Ni-base superalloys under tensile creep. Rafting was accompanied by a decreasing creep rate indicating a hardening effect, although cutting of gamma' rafts by partial dislocations under the formation of stacking faults occurred.

All the tested alloys are active but passivable materials. The active state is characterised by a rapid dissolution of the constitutive elements of the alloy in the glass melt. The passive state can be obtained by an air oxidation of the alloys (called preoxidation) or with a temporary anodic polarisation of the alloy.

TI Corrosion behavior of new type Co-based superalloys with different Ni
   contents
SO CORROSION REVIEWS
AB The corrosion properties of gamma'-strengthened Cox Ni-Al-W-Cr (where x = 15, 20, 25, and 30 at.%) superalloys were investigated in the mixture of 75 wt.% Na-2 SO4 + 25 wt.% NaCl at 900 degrees C. The results showed that the corrosion behavior is associated with both sulfuration and oxidation processes. It was demonstrated that increasing the addition of Ni effectively promoted the formation of continuous Al2O3 scales, so that the hot corrosion resistance could be improved. When Ni content is more than 20 at.%, a large amount of Ni3S2 precipitates during the corrosion process. Sulfuration can destroy the integrity of the corrosion layer and increase the activity of oxygen. In this way, the internal oxidation of the alloys becomes more serious. Therefore, it is recommended that the optimum Ni addition is about 20 at.% for new type Co-Ni-Al-W-Cr superalloys.

TI Diffusion of Co, Ru and Re in Ni-based superalloys: A first-principles
   study
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Self and impurity diffusivities in Ni-based superalloys have been investigated by first-principles calculations within five-frequency model. The vacancy formation energy, migration energy, correlation factor, solute-vacancy binding enthalpies and entropies in vacancy-mediated diffusions have been considered. The positive solute-vacancy binding energies for Co, Ru and Re indicated that the solute-vacancy pair is not a favorable binding. From the electronic point of view, the origination of the repulsive interaction between solute and vacancy has been comprehensibly expatiated on, which possibly accounts for the low diffusivity of Re element. The calculated self and impurity diffusion coefficients show a good consistent with the reported data from experiments and it is found that the trend in diffusivity is D-Co > DNi-self > D-Ru > D-Re.

TI Degradation processes in high-temperature creep of cast cobalt-based
   superalloys
SO MATERIALS CHARACTERIZATION
AB Degradation processes in high-temperature creep of two cast high-chromium cobalt-based superalloys strengthened by niobium and tantalum for use in the glass industry were analysed via various experimental techniques. Constant load creep tests were conducted at 900, 950 and 1000 degrees C in a tensile stress range from 40 to 80 MPa. It was found that the CoNb superalloy possesses considerably longer creep life compared to the CoTa superalloy under the same loading conditions. Conversely, the creep ductility of the fractured specimens shows the opposite order of the creep life. The creep behaviour of both superalloys obeys the Monkman-Grant formula indicating that the creep deformation mechanism and fracture processes are mutually interlinked. The homogeneously distributed creep damage of the CoNb superalloy is closely connected with primary carbides and is predominantly initiated either as interface decohesion between the carbide/matrix and carbide eutectics/matrix or by breakage of bulk M23C6 carbides. The dominant type of creep damage in the CoTa superalloy is localized breakage of M23C6 carbides in close proximity of the fracture path. The final brittle fracture in the CoNb superalloy occurs via relatively fast propagation of the longest cracks after the ultimate state of damage is reached. Due to premature fracture, the inherent creep ductility of the CoNb matrix is not exhausted. The final ductile transgranular creep fracture of the CoTa superalloy is caused by a local strain-induced instability of the dislocation microstructure leading to a loss of an external section of specimen (necking).

The results revealed that Mo promoted the formation of (mu+gamma) eutectic structure in the as-cast alloys and mu-phase precipitation after solution treatment. In addition, after aging treatment at 900 C, an extensive network of DO(19) precipitates was observed, besides the gamma+gamma' primary phases and the mu phase inherited from the as-cast and solution-treated conditions. Meanwhile, a solid-state transformation from the)1 phase to the DO(19) phase occurred; and long-term aging enhanced this transformation. In addition, high levels of Mo promoted the DO(19)-phase precipitation.

TI Influence of the alloying elements Re, Co and W on the propagation of
   the Ni/Ni3Al interface crack
SO RSC ADVANCES
AB The influence of the alloying elements Re, Co and W on the propagation of the (010)[ 101] Ni/Ni3Al interface crack has been investigated by molecular dynamics simulations and the discrete-variational method. The simulation results show that the interface crack propagates in a brittle manner at low temperature (5 K), but in a ductile manner at high temperature (1273 K), both with and without the addition of alloying elements. Owing to the scientific and technological importance of superalloys, the effects of the chemical bonding behavior between the alloying element X (X = Re, Co, or W) and Ni atoms on the crack shape, crack propagation velocity, and dislocation emission were investigated. At low temperature, the alloying elements Re and W inhibit the propagation of the Ni/Ni3Al interface crack, while at high temperature Re, Co and W can improve the ductility of Ni-based single-crystal superalloys. Furthermore, the adhesion work of the interface, surface energy, and unstable stacking energy were calculated to understand the propagation mechanism of the Ni/Ni3Al interface crack because of alloying element addition. The results of this study may provide useful information for the design of Ni-based superalloys.

TI On diffusion behaviors in face centered cubic phase of Al-Co-Cr-Fe-Ni-Ti
   high-entropy superalloys
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Owning the excellent high temperature properties, low cost and density, Al-Co-Cr-Fe-Ni-Ti high-entropy superalloys (HESAs) represent a potential substitute for Ni-based superalloys. In this paper, the composition-dependent interdiffusivity matrices of face centered cubic (fcc) Al-Co-Cr-Fe-Ni-Ti HESAs at 1473 K were first determined via a combination of diffusion multiple technique and HitDIC software based on the numerical inverse method. The correlations between the main interdiffusivities and the components suggest that alloying elements play great impact on diffusion in HESAs. After that, comprehensive comparisons of the interdiffusivities and tracer diffusivities in present fcc HESAs with the literature data in fcc-based pure elements, lower-order alloys and traditional high-entropy alloys were conducted. The results indicate that the sluggish diffusion effect exists for only some of the components in the present HESAs. Moreover, comparisons of the diffusion coefficients between the HESAs and traditional Ni-based superalloys with refractory elements show that the interdiffusivities in the present HESAs are lower than the Ni-based superalloys with most refractory elements, but higher than those with Ir, Re and Os. Furthermore, it is also found that refractory elements need to be added in order to further improve the creep resistance of the HESAs. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Medium and high entropy superalloys based on the Ni-Co-Fe system with strengthening L1(2) gamma' precipitates have been developed. The present study has shown that by controlling the elemental partitioning between gamma/gamma', thermal stability of gamma' can be enhanced in the high entropy gamma matrix. Most importantly, high entropy superalloys exhibit stable gamma-gamma' microstructures with no TCP phases after long-term exposure at elevated temperatures. Therefore, a new alloy design space for stable gamma-gamma' microstructure has been presented. Furthermore, due to relatively high content of Fe and Ti, their raw materials cost and alloy density can potentially be lower than those of conventional superalloys.

All alloys examined comprised cuboidal L1(2) precipitates coherently embedded in an A1 matrix. Differential scanning calorimetry measurements revealed that the liquidus, solidus, and gamma'-solvus temperatures decrease when the Ge content is increased. The lower liquidus temperature and the capability of gamma'-strengthening in the Ge-rich alloys make them interesting as potential candidates for brazing applications of Co-base superalloys. The gamma/gamma' lattice misfit was determined by high-resolution X-ray diffraction and found to be positive for all alloys investigated, decreasing with increasing Ge content.

SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA-ENGLISH LETTERS
AB It has been recently pointed out that the compositions of industrial alloys are originated from cluster-plus-glueatom structure units in solid solutions. Specifically for Ni-based superalloys, after properly grouping the alloying elements into Al, Ni-like ((Ni) over bar), gamma'-forming Cr-like ((Cr) over tilde (gamma')) and gamma-forming Cr-like ((Cr) over bar (gamma)), the optimal formula for single-crystal superalloys is established [ Al-(Ni) over bar (12)](Al-1(Cr) over bar (gamma')(0.5) (Cr) over bar (gamma)(1.5)). The Co substitutions for Ni at the shell sites are conducted on the basis of the first-generation single-crystal superalloy AM3, formulated as [Al-Ni12-xCox](Al1Ti0.25Ta0.25Cr1W0.25Mo0.25), with x = 1.5, 1.75, 2 and 2.5 (the corresponding weight percents of Co are 9.43, 11.0, 12.57 and 15.71, respectively). The 900 degrees C long-term aging follows the Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner theory (LSW theory), and the Co content does not have noticeable influence on the coarsening rate of gamma'. The microstructure and creep behavior of the four (001) single-crystal alloys are investigated. The creep rupture lifetime is reduced as Co increases. The alloy with the lowest Co (9.43 Co) shows the longest lifetime of about 350 h at 1050 degrees C/120 MPa, and all the samples show N-type rafting after creep tests.

TI The synchronous improvement of strength and plasticity (SISP) in new
   Ni-Co based disc superalloys by controling stacking fault energy
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB It is a great challenge to improve the strength of disc superalloys without great loss of plasticity together since the microstructures benefiting the strength always do not avail the plasticity. Interestingly, this study shows that the trade-off relationship between strength and plasticity can be broken through decreasing stacking fault energy (SFE) in newly developed Ni-Co based disc superalloys. Axial tensile tests in the temperature range of 25 to 725 degrees C were carried out in these alloys with Co content ranging from 5% to 23% (wt.%). It is found that the ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and uniform elongation (UE) are improved synchronously when microtwinning is activated by decreasing the SFE at 650 and 725 degrees C. In contrast, only UTS is improved when stacking fault (SF) dominates the plastic deformation at 25 and 400 degrees C. These results may be helpful for designing advanced disc superalloys with relatively excellent strength and plasticity simultaneously.

AB Austenitic stainless steels, titanium and cobalt alloys are widely used as biomaterials. However, new medical devices require innovative materials with specific properties, depending on their application. The magnetic properties are among the properties of interest for some biomedical applications. However, due to the interaction of magnetic materials with Magnetic Resonance Image equipments they might used only as not fixed implants or for medical devices. The ferromagnetic superalloys, Incoloy MA 956 and PM 2000, produced by mechanical alloying, have similar chemical composition, high corrosion resistance and are used in high temperature applications. In this study, the corrosion resistance of these two ferritic superalloys was compared in a phosphate buffer solution. The electrochemical results showed that both superalloys are passive in this solution and the PM 2000 present a more protective passive film on it associated to higher impedances than the MA 956.

TI Influence of carbon content in cobalt-based superalloys on mechanical
   and wear properties
SO JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING MATERIALS AND TECHNOLOGY-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME
AB Two cobalt-based superalloys containing 1.6% and 2% carbon respectively were studied, with the emphasis on the influence of the carbon content on their microstructures, wear resistance, and mechanical properties. Phase formation and transformation in the microstructures were analyzed using metallographic, X-ray diffraction, and differential scanning calorimetry techniques. Wear resistance, tensile and fatigue behaviors of the alloys were investigated on a pin-on-disc tribometer MTS machine and rotating-bending machine, respectively. It is found that the wear resistance was increased significantly with the carbon content. The mechanical proper-ties of the alloys are also influenced by the carbon content, but the impact is not so significant as on the wear resistance. It was observed that the carbon content increased the yielding strength and fatigue strength, but decreased the fracture stress and fracture strain.

TI Design of Novel Precipitate-Strengthened Al-Co-Cr-Fe-Nb-Ni High-Entropy
   Superalloys
SO METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND
   MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB A series of non-equiatomic Al-Co-Cr-Fe-Nb-Ni high-entropy alloys, with varying levels of Co, Nb and Fe, were investigated in an effort to obtain microstructures similar to conventional Ni-based superalloys. Elevated levels of Co were observed to significantly decrease the solvus temperature of the gamma' precipitates. Both Nb and Co in excessive concentrations promoted the formation of Laves and NiAl phases that formed either during solidification and remained undissolved during homogenization or upon high-temperature aging. Lowering the content of Nb, Co, or Fe prevented the formation of the eutectic type Laves. In addition, lowering the Co content resulted in a higher number density and volume fraction of the gamma' precipitates, while increasing the Fe content led to the destabilization of the gamma' precipitates. Various aging treatments were performed which led to different size distributions of the strengthening phase. Results from the microstructural characterization and hardness property assessments of these high-entropy alloys were compared to a commercial, high-strength Ni-based superalloy RR1000. Potentially, precipitation-strengthened high-entropy alloys could find applications replacing Ni-based superalloys as structural materials in power generation applications.

TI Atomistic phase field chemomechanical modeling of
   dislocation-solute-precipitate interaction in Ni-Al-Co
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB Dislocation-precipitate interaction and solute segregation play important roles in controlling the mechanical behavior of Ni-based superalloys at high temperature. In particular, the increased mobility of solutes at high temperature leads to increased dislocation-solute interaction. For example, atom probe tomography (APT) results [1] for single crystal MC2 superalloy indicate significant segregation of solute elements such as Co and Cr to dislocations and stacking faults in gamma' precipitates. To gain further insight into solute segregation, dislocation-solute interaction, and its effect on the mechanical behavior in such Ni-superalloys, finite-deformation phase field chemomechanics [2] is applied in this work to develop a model for dislocation-solute-precipitate interaction in the two-phase gamma-gamma' Ni-based superalloy model system Ni-Al-Co. Identification and quantification of this model is based in particular on the corresponding Ni-Al-Co embedded atom method (EAM) potential [3]. Simulation results imply both Cottrell and Suzuki-type segregation of Co in gamma and gamma'. Significant segregation of Co to dislocation cores and faults in gamma' is also predicted, in agreement with APT results. Predicted as well is the drag of Co by gamma dislocations entering and shearing gamma'. Since solute elements such as Co generally prefer the gamma phase, Co depletion in gamma' could be reversed by such dislocation drag. The resulting change in precipitate chemistry may in turn affect its stability and play a role in precipitate coarsening and rafting. (C) 2019 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

   superalloys
SO SURFACE ENGINEERING
AB High temperature oxidation occurs in many equipments ranging from gas turbines, boilers, heat treating retorts to heat exchangers. Superalloys are used for such applications due to their excellent mechanical properties and creep resistance, but lack resistance to oxidation. In the present investigation, Al2O3-40TiO(2) coating has been deposited on nickel and cobalt based superalloys by low velocity oxyfuel (LVOF) process. The coating has been characterised for scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and surface roughness. The high temperature oxidation behaviour of coated and uncoated superalloys has been evaluated at 800 degrees C for 50 cycles of one hour duration. The LVOF coating has shown good adherence to the substrate. AE 435 superalloy has shown the highest weight gain amongst the tested materials, whereas Al2O3-40TiO(2) coated Superco 605 superalloy has shown the lowest weight gain. The better oxidation resistance of Al2O3-40TiO(2) coating might be attributed to the presence of protective Al2O3 phase along with TiO2 phase in it.

AB The precipitation of the lamellar-shaped M23C6 carbide within the dendritic matrix of a cobalt-base superalloy during thermal exposure at 1000 degrees C has been investigated. Such a precipitation is not commonly observed in cobalt-base superalloys. It is found that M23C6 particles nucleate preferentially at stacking faults (SFs) in the dendritic matrix and grow along the SFs to develop a lamellar character. Additionally, a Cr depletion zone is observed in the vicinity of the lamellar M23C6 carbide, which strongly supports the presence of Suzuki segregation.

Full-scale pancakes (440 mm in diameter and 65 mm in thickness) with an average grain size of about 10 pm were successfully manufactured by a conventional C&W processing route. TMW alloys can provide 58-76 degrees C temperature advantages over alloy U720Li in 0.2% creep strain life under 630 MPa and are comparable with the advanced PM disc superalloys. In this work, the alloy design, preparation processing capacity, micro-structural control, performance characteristics and deformation strengthening mechanisms were briefly introduced.

CY APR 12-16, 2015
CL Toronto, CANADA
AB Cobalt-based superalloys are used in aero-engine combustor components due to their high strength and wear resistance at elevated temperatures. The objective of this investigation is to study the role of the surface oxide formed during the fretting process on the tribological behavior of this class of materials, at temperatures up to 550 degrees C. The investigation, which was carried out using a specially designed tribometer, showed that the wear coefficient and the coefficient of friction (COF) generally decrease with the increase of temperature at different work rates. When the work rate was fixed at relatively high value (350 mJ/s), the wear coefficient was found to decrease monotonically with temperature, while the COF experienced a peak at 200 degrees C. Analysis of the specimen fretted at 200 degrees C showed that the hard wear debris promoted abrasive wear and caused an increase in the COF. In addition, the formed oxide was thin, non-continuous and contained mainly cobalt monoxide (CoO), which contributed to the increase in the COF. Analysis of the specimen fretted at 550 degrees C showed that the wear damage decreased due to the formation of a continuous thick protective oxide containing mainly chromium (III) oxide (Cr2O3), known for its good tribological characteristics. It has also been observed that delamination wear took place within this oxide layer. When the oxide composition and thickness inside and outside the fretted area were compared, it was concluded that the real contact temperature exceeded 600 degrees C due to the frictional heat.

AB With the aim of understanding how to further improve the creep resistance of Co-Al-W-base superalloys at higher temperature (> 1223 K), the creep behavior of a novel Co-Al-W-base single-crystal superalloy at 1273 K/137 MPa was systematically investigated. Several interrupted creep tests were performed and the main deformation mechanisms of characteristic creep stages were identified and correlated to both the gamma/gamma' microstructural and dislocation substructural evolutions. Two steady-state creep stages were observed during the creep process. The interfacial dislocations and the formation of rafts were responsible for the first steady-state creep stage, while the second steady-state creep stage could be ascribed to interactions between stacking faults of different slip systems in an inverted gamma/gamma' microstructure, e.g., the formation of Lomer-Cottrell locks by the leading partials of the SFs. The observed creep mechanisms were compared to those typical of Ni-base superalloys at similar creep conditions. It is suggested that a high stacking fault energy of the gamma' phase and a higher gamma' volume fraction may be favorable for creep resistance of Co-Al-W-base single-crystal superalloys by promoting the double steady-state creep phenomenon.

TI THE CURRENT SITUATION OF APPLICATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF SUPERALLOYS IN
   THE FIELDS OF ENERGY INDUSTRY
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB Superalloys are extensively applied in the fields of energy industry. In the high parameter ultra-supercritical boiler used for coal-fired generation, superheater/reheater tubes must be made of superalloys which meet the requirement of good creep resistant, good fire-side corrosion resistant and steam-side oxidation resistant properties. In gas turbine engine used for gas power, turbine blades and guide vanes should be made of hot-corrosion resistant superalloys which must meet the requirements with respect to excellent high temperature corrosion resistance and long-term microstructural stability. In the field of nuclear power, heat exchange tubes used for steam generator require superalloys with excellent solution corrosion resistance. In the field of coal gasification and energy conservation and pollution reduction, the superalloys with excellent hot corrosion resistant and high temperature wear resistant properties are widely applied. In petroleum exploitation, especially in deep mining, drilling tools must be made of corrosion resistant and wear resistant superalloys because of the sour environment, the temperature of 4-150 degrees C and the existences of CO(2), H(2)S, sand and so on. This paper makes a brief introduction on the current situation of application and development of the superalloys at home and abroad in these fields.

AB The methodology of phase diagrams and that of alloy design were reviewed. The construction of a thermodynamic database for multicomponent systems by the CALPHAD method are shown, where the first principles calculations play a significant role in the estimation of thermodynamic properties of metastable phases. Some examples of alloy design for advanced materials using phase diagrams are shown in Pb-free machinable steels, high strength steels with low density, superelastic Fe-based and Cu-based alloys, magnetic recording media of Co-Cr-based alloys and Co-based superalloys.

TI CREEP-RUPTURE LIFE AND ALLOY MANUFACTURING CRITERION RELATED TO THE
   SOLIDIFICATION AND PRECIPITATION TEMPERATURES IN NICKEL-BASED
   SINGLE-CRYSTAL SUPERALLOYS
SO TETSU TO HAGANE-JOURNAL OF THE IRON AND STEEL INSTITUTE OF JAPAN
AB The solidification and precipitation temperatures were measured and were correlated with the creep-rupture property and the microstructure of nickel-based single crystal superalloys.  For three Co-content varying Ni-10 mol% Cr-12 mol% Al-1.5 mol% Ti-Ta-W-Mo-0.25 mol% Re-0/4.5/9.0 mol% Co alloys and also for three Cr-content varying Ni-10/13/16 mol% Cr-12 mol% Al-1.2 mol%Ti-Ta-W-Mo alloys, the liquidus, solidus, eutectic gamma' precipitation and gamma' solvus temperatures were determined by differential thermal analysis (DTA).  It was found that as the Co and Cr contents increased, the gamma' solvus temperature decreased and there was the attendant decrease in the volume fraction of the gamma' phase in the alloys.  In response to these changes the creep-rupture lives decreased with the Co and Cr contents.  These results imply that the gamma' solvus temperature is an indication of the creep-rupture lives of the nickel-based superalloys.  In addition, a manufacturing condition for single-crystal growth was estimated from the measured solidification temperature range of alloys.  All of the six alloys were shown to meet this condition, and their single crystals were grown successfully in agreement with the estimation.

TI Effective design of a Co-Ni-Al-W-Ta-Ti alloy with high gamma ' solvus
   temperature and microstructural stability using combined CALPHAD and
   experimental approaches
SO MATERIALS & DESIGN
AB Alloy design of a Co-Ni-Al-W-Ta-Ti senary alloy was performed through a CALPHAD (CALculation of PHAse Diagrams) approach coupled with experimental investigation, with aim to attain high gamma' solvus temperature, microstructural stability, as well as low density. The results of the thermodynamic calculations indicated that increasing the Ni content would broaden the gamma + gamma' two-phase region, meanwhile simultaneously increasing the Ni content and the Al/W ratio would lead to high gamma' solvus temperature and microstructural stability. The experimental results indicated that a high Al/W ratio with a high Ni content of > 20 at.% was beneficial not only for obtaining a high gamma' solvus temperature, but also for realizing high microstructural stability and low density in these Co-Al-W-base superalloys. Increasing the Ni content enhanced the hardness of both the gamma and gamma' phases, while increasing the AIM ratio had an opposite effect. The optimized alloy, Co-30Ni-11Al-4W-1Ta-4Ti (at.%), demonstrated solvus temperature of above 1200 degrees C, low density of 8.76 g/cm(3), and excellent microstructural stability after aging at 1150 degrees C for 1000 h. This study will be helpful for the continuous efforts on the development of Co-Al-W-base superalloys for industrial application, as well as populating thermodynamic databases. (C) 2019 The Authors.

TI Microstructure evolution in L1(2) hardened Co-base superalloys during
   creep
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS RESEARCH
AB The plastic deformation mechanisms and the microstructure development during creep deformation of L1(2)-hardened Co-base superalloys show a number of unique features. The preferred orientation of rafting is determined by their positive lattice mismatch. In addition, the regular interfacial dislocation networks often found in rafted specimens of other types of superalloys do not form. While the ordered gamma'-L1(2) precipitates are supposed to harden the material, they are actually found to be frequently cut by partial dislocations generating stacking faults. In this work, specimens from creep tests interrupted at different strains were investigated using transmission and scanning electron microscopy. By this, it is possible to find out which of these processes take place in which stage of creep deformation. For a better understanding of creep deformation, the balance between gamma' cutting and dislocation activity within the matrix channels is of special interest.

TI Evolution of microstructure and mechanical properties of coated Co-base
   superalloys during heat treatment and thermal exposure
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB New gamma'-strengthened Co-base superalloys show an interesting potential for high temperature applications. However, protective coatings are needed as for Ni-base superalloys to ensure sufficient oxidation and corrosion resistance. Therefore the properties of a commercial coating on a multinary new gamma'-strengthened Co-base superalloy have been studied. Especially the influence of the coating process on the substrate also after long term annealing is discussed. It was found that the highly deformed areas at the coating-substrate interface indicated by a high local misorientation and caused by the sandblasting process led to a recrystallization of the interdiffusion zone during the age hardening heat treatment. A chemical gradient of gamma and gamma' promoting elements was found in the interdiffusion zone causing a change in hardness as measured by nanoindentation. Depending on the composition two separate recrystallized regions formed in the interdiffusion zone, one with single phase gamma-(Co,Ni) and the other with a cellular two phase microstructure of discontinuously grown gamma and gamma'.

TI Temperature dependence of thermodynamic stability and mechanical
   property of alloying Co3Ta compounds
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB The aim of this work is to search for novel Co-based superalloys from first-principles calculations. Based on the Co3Ta binary system, which is a promising L1(2) (gamma') strengthened compound, the effects of alloying element X (X = Ru, Rh, Pd, Re, Ir and Pt) on the thermal stability and mechanical property were investigated. The temperature effect is taken into account in the framework of quasi-harmonic Debye theory. According to the present results, Ru and Rh are the promising alloying elements to improve the stability of gamma'-Co3Ta compound against its competitive phase D0(19). Particularly, Ru and Rh exhibit improved performance of both mechanical strengthening and structural stabilization. There theoretical predictions in terms of the thermodynamic stability of Co-Ta-X (Ru and Ru) compounds were experimentally verified. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Current status of Co-Re-based alloys being developed to supplement
   Ni-based superalloys for ultra-high temperature applications in gas
   turbines
SO KOVOVE MATERIALY-METALLIC MATERIALS
AB Although Ni-based sup eralloys meet the gas turbine needs of today, they are used very close to their melting range. To meet the future demands of gas turbines new materials with higher application temperatures are needed. Addition of Re increases the melting temperature of Co-based alloys and they show promise to supplement Ni-superalloys for ultra high temperature applications. The Co-Re alloy development strategy is first discussed here briefly. Unlike single crystal Ni-superalloys with the gamma-gamma' structure, the Co-Re alloys have complex microstructure with many different phases present in diverse morphology. MC type carbides are the main hardening precipitate particularly used for high temperature creep resistance. Further, Cr and Si additions in Co-Re alloys provide oxidation resistance. Designing optimal microstructure and ensuring its stability is an essential task of high temperature alloy development. In our alloy development program neutron and synchrotron measurements are extensively used. It allows monitoring the microstructure evolution in-situ at high temperatures and thereby helps in understanding the relatively unexplored Co-Re alloy system. Recent results on the effect of C/Ta ratio on the TaC morphology in Co-Re-based alloys are presented as well.

Based on the compositions of alloys and their gamma' phase, gamma phase compositions and gamma' phase amounts were calculated with the use of the layered multi objective optimization algorithmic approach with tolerance. The optimization process was realized by establishing two relating objective functions and the corresponding constrained conditions. The results verified the feasibility and the accuracy of the present method.

AB Heavy duty engine valve head was prepared by Ni76Cr19AlTi alloy. It was coated by cobalt-base alloy on the surface to promote its wear-resistance. Hardness tester, metallograph, scanning microscopy, energy spectrum and X-ray diffraction were used to analyze the mechanical properties, the microstructure of the welds and the coated layer of cobalt-base alloy. The results show that the grains are obviously coasened in the side of Ni76Cr19AITi alloy in the welds and it contains a typical dentritic structure in the side cobalt-base alloy. It is found that micro-strain in weld is stronger than that in heat-effected-zone. Micro-strain in nickel-base alloy is stronger than that cobalt-base alloy. There are not obvious imperfects in the weld. Hardness in cobalt-base alloy is more than 390HV and the major carbides in cobalt-base alloy are Cr7C3 and W2C.

TI Intermediate temperature internal oxidation in fourth generation
   Ru-bearing single-crystal nickel-base superalloys
SO OXIDATION OF METALS
AB Fourth-generation, Ru-bearing, Ni-base superalloys offer superior microstructural stability over previous generations, affording greater density-corrected creep strength, but in common with their predecessors, have only borderline ability to form and maintain a protective oxide layer. This is particularly so at intermediate temperatures of around 750 degrees C at which temperature internal oxidation can occur. In this present study, the nature of this attack has been examined in experimental 3 and 5 mass % Ru alloys. Both these alloys exhibited dispersed regions of oxide-filled pits whose depth increased parabolically with isothermal exposure time at a similar rate. Pits appear to nucleate progressively straight from the initial competitive oxidation stage. In all cases, the pits were associated with a surface mound of nickel- and cobalt-rich oxides. The results of detailed metallographic examination of the internal oxidation products are provided.

AB Microstructural instability involving the formation of topologically close-packed (TCP) phases is restricted during the alloy development of Ni-based single crystal superalloys. In this study, the effects of alloying elements including Co, Cr, Mo and Ru on the formation of different TCP phases were investigated in a series of single crystal superalloys. Experimental results showed that more additions of Cr and Mo promoted the TCP phase formation, while Co and Ru played a positive role in improving microstructural stability. It is indicated that sigma, P and R phases existed with various morphology and compositions in different experimental alloys during thermal exposure at 1100 degrees C. The content of Co, Cr and Mo in those alloys affected the types of TCP phases significantly, while Ru additions showed a negligible effect. R phase was prone to form in alloys containing high level of Co addition. Meanwhile, the ratio of Cr and Mo content had strong influence on the formation of sigma and P phases in alloys containing low level of Co addition. The effects of alloying additions on the elemental partitioning ratios between gamma and gamma' phases contributed to their corresponding influence on TCP phase formation.

High resolution X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to relate the elemental partitioning behavior and the Vegard coefficients of the elements under investigation to the measured lattice parameter of the gamma and gamma' phase. The residual chemical segregation and especially the coherency stress-induced tetragonal distortion of the gamma matrix lattice in the high Mo containing alloys results in the observation of two different lattice parameters for the gamma matrix phase. This leads to three overlapping, but clearly distinguishable {002} X-ray reflections.

TI Interaction between Re and W on the microstructural stability of
   Ni-based single-crystal superalloys
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The influences of Re and W as well as their interaction on gamma and topologically close-packed (TCP) phases have been investigated in seven kinds of Ni-based single-crystal superalloys. The results show that after full heat treatment, the gamma size is reduced with increasing Re, but does not change with increasing W. After thermal exposure at 1000 degrees C for 1000h, the TCP phase is dramatically increased with increasing Re, but increased slightly with increasing W. The TCP phase volume fraction in higher Re alloys is much more than that in lower Re alloys which have the same total content of Re and W. This indicates that W instead of Re could effectively improve the microstructural stability of Ni-based single-crystal superalloys.

AB With the goals of exploring the feasibility of improving the yield strength without decreasing the hot workability, four novel Co-30Ni-(7-x)Al-2W-1.5Mo-1Ta-(3.5 + y)Ti-12Cr-0.1Hf-0.08C-0.08B-0.4Si-0.01Zr (x = 0, 1, 1.5, 3, y = 0, 0, 0.7, 1.4 at%) gamma'-strengthened wrought Co-base superalloys were designed, and the effects of Al and Ti on microstructure and properties of gamma'-strengthened wrought Co-base superalloys were analyzed. Comparing the alloys 7Al-3.5Ti, 5.5Al-4.2Ti and 4Al-4.9Ti with the similar hot workability, the Al(at%)/Ti(at%) in the gamma' decreased with the decrease of Al(at%)/Ti(at%) in the alloys, this composition change in the gamma' made the alloys' yield strength at room temperature and 800 degrees C increase from 915 MPa to 1025 MPa and from 764 MPa to 826 MPa, respectively. Based on the 6Al-3.5Ti alloy, the addition of 1 at% Al changed the gamma' compositions, which resulted in a decrease of yield strength at room temperature by 45 MPa but a significant increase of yield strength by 108 MPa at 800 degrees C, and this significant increase of yield strength at 800 degrees C may also be associated with the formation of numerous microtwins in 7Al-3.5Ti alloy; In the four experimental alloys, Mo preferentially partitions to the gamma matrix, the relative content of Al and Ti has a negligible influence on the hot deformation resistance at 1150 degrees C, and there is no harmful phase after a heat treatment of 900 degrees C at 8 h + 750 degrees C at 12 h.

AB Metallic materials used in the hottest parts of glass making machines are exposed to mechanical deformation, oxidation by different gases and hot corrosion by molten glass. Here the oxidation and corrosion behaviour of cobalt base superalloys are studied. The use of both thermogravimetry and electrochemical techniques allows a good and quantified knowledge about these properties. After a wide characterization of two reference alloys, this work focused on the influence of several parameters, which belong to either the chemical and microstructural ones or to the process ones. It has been done with the elaboration and the study of other alloys which differ from the references on the carbon, tantalum or tungsten contents, and by varying the time/temperature preoxidation couple or the glass/alloy relative movement. For example, it appeared that high contents of carbon or heavy elements lead to a faster oxidation, and all alloys can get a passive state if preoxidised during a sufficient time that depends on the temperature.

TI Dislocation structures in single crystal nickel- and cobalt-based
   superalloys under tensile and fatigue loading
SO DEFECT AND DIFFUSION FORUM
AB Dislocation structures in monocrystalline nickel-based superalloys DD8, ZS26 and a directionally solidified cobalt-based superalloy under tensile and fatigue loading are reviewed. An investigation of dislocation structure in DD8 during fatigue loading at 760 degrees C was conducted. Dislocation bands and three-dimensional networks were found in the matrix, Most of the dislocations observed in the gamma'-phase were in the form of superdislocations. The superimposition of the cyclic component to the process of creep resulted in a minor effect on lifetime of single crystal nickel-based superalloy ZS26. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) reveals different mechanisms of dislocation-gamma' precipitate interaction under various loading conditions. In addition, TEM in-situ investigation of dislocation behaviour at the crack tip in single crystal nickel-based superalloy DD8 was carried out. Dislocation free zone (DFZ) ahead of the crack tip was frequently observed and affected by the nearby gamma/gamma' interfaces. The defects induced by cyclic straining in the single crystal cobalt-based superalloy are mainly characterized by stacking faults and their intersections.

TI Sliding wear of various materials in molten zinc
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB A full journal bearing tester was built to study wear behaviour of materials sliding in molten zinc. Various material combinations, including cobalt based superalloys, cermet coatings (on 316L stainless steel substrates), and ceramics were evaluated at conditions similar to continuous galvanising line (CGL) operations. Metallographic and chemical analyses were conducted on tested specimens to characterise the wear. Cobalt based superalloys not only suffered considerable wear but also reacted with molten zinc to form intermetallic compounds. Cermet coatings and ceramics experienced noticeable wear although they were non-wettable and did not react with zinc baths. The study showed that MgO stabilised ZrO2 suffered the most wear when running against laser clad WC coated 316L while the combination of SiAION and laser clad WC coated 316L showed the least amount of wear. The composite nature of hard particles imbedded in a soft matrix, posing resistance against. both abrasive and surface fatigue wear, is believed to be the reason that laser clad WC coatings can withstand wear in molten zinc.

SO SCRIPTA MATERIALIA
AB The rafting of monocrystalline Ni- and Co-based superalloys has been studied by neutron diffractometry. Lattice parameter misfit values and the difference in phase stiffnesses at room temperature, 650 degrees C, and 900 degrees C are presented. These microstructural parameters should assist in refining computer models that aim to predict precipitate evolution in superalloys and aid future alloy design. The nature of rafting is shown experimentally to be dependent upon the lattice parameter misfit. The 900 degrees C yield strength of the gamma-phase of the Co-based superalloy with a rafted microstructure occurs at similar to 100 MPa, when loaded at a low strain rate.

AB TMW (R) superalloys have superior mechanical properties up to 725 degrees C. Numerous annealing twins are present because these alloys have relatively low stacking fault energies. Nanoscale deformation twins are the dominant mechanism during creep and tensile testing at 725 degrees C. In addition to traditional strengthening mechanisms enhanced by higher Ti addition, twinning structures enhanced by higher Co addition also play an important role in strengthening coarse-grained alloys at high temperatures. The effects of twin strengthening are discussed. (C) 2012 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI MICROSTRUCTURAL CHARACTERIZATION OF WELDING ON A COBALT BASE SUPERALLOY
SO ACTA MICROSCOPICA
AB Cobalt base superalloys are widely used in the aerospace industry, specifically in the combustion chamber of high-power turbines, it presents greater weldability when compared with other superalloys, however it is necessary to find optimal conditions in the welding process for high resistance. This work aims to study the effect of shielding gas on the microstructure and hardness in the welding of a cobalt base superalloy, through the process Tungsten Inert Gas (TIG). We used the argon shielding gas and the mixture argon-20% CO2, and as filler alloy Hastelloy X. The analysis of the microstructural characteristics of welded joints was performed using optical microscopy (OM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), where he noted that the solidification structure in the center of the weld-dendritic cells and the interfacial weld metal-base columnar dendritic. Hardness testing of welded plates, was performed on the base metal interface and center of the weld, using the Vickers hardness test, this showed that the hardness decreases for both shielding gases from the base metal to center of the weld, which is attributed to the possible dissolution of carbides in the W-Cr welding process. It was determined that the welds with argon as protective gas, have the most beneficial conditions for TIG welding, as this gives a more homogeneous microstructure, higher hardness and less microporosity.

TI Site preference and interaction energies of Co and Cr in gamma prime
   Ni3Al: a first-principles study
SO MODELLING AND SIMULATION IN MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
AB Nickel-based superalloys are critical for aerospace and power applications due to excellent high-temperature properties. These high-temperature properties are attributed to the coherently precipitated gamma prime phase in the gamma matrix. The segregation of alloying elements between the matrix and the gamma prime phase drives precipitate misfit strains and impacts material strength. This study aims at understanding the site preference of Co and Cr within the ordered gamma prime phase. The study also calculates the interaction energy between alloying additions within the ternary systems Ni-Al-Cr and Ni-Al-Co, and the quaternary system Ni-Al-Cr-Co. It is found that Co has mixed substitution behavior between the Al and Ni sites in the gamma prime phase. The results from the Ni-Al-Cr ternary system show that two Cr atoms prefer being close to each other, with the most stable configuration of the first nearest neighbors of the Al-Al site. The interaction energies calculated from the Ni-Al-Co system show that the initial distance between two Co atoms will decide whether the two Co atoms prefer Ni-Ni or Ni-Al configuration. The study on the quaternary system Ni-Al-Cr-Co reveals that the initial configuration of Cr and Co atoms will affect the final most stable configuration. The results are found to be consistent with our previous findings.

TI Effect of Pre-Oxidation on High Temperature Oxidation and Corrosion
   Behavior of Co-Al-W-Based Superalloy
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB In 2006, stable gamma' phase was found in Co-Al-W alloy, which provides a new way for developing Co-based superalloys. In order to meet the requirements for applications, the Co-Al-W-based superalloys need to have good oxidation and corrosion resistance. But the oxidation and corrosion resistance of the Co-Al-W-based superalloys is relatively low. In this work, pre-oxidation treatments were to improve the oxidation and corrosion resistance. Three types of pre-oxidation treatments were carried out at 900 degrees C (in air), 950 degrees C (in air) and 1000 degrees C (in 1%O-2 +99%Ar), which were marked as 900-PreO, 950-PreO and 1000-LPreO, respectively. High temperature oxidation tests of both the pre-oxidation treated and untreated superalloys were carried out at 1000 degrees C. And hot corrosion behaviors were also investigated at both 800 and 850 degrees C. XRD, SEM and EDS were used to examine the characteristics of the oxidation and corrosion behaviors. The results show that the pre-oxide layers of the superalloys after different pre-oxidation treatments are compact. During oxidation at 1000 degrees C, the Cr2O3 scale in 900-PreO treated superalloy is oxidized to form volatile products, and the diffusion resistance of both oxygen and the metal elements through the oxide layer is poor. In 1000-LPreO treated superalloy, serious spallation of the oxides occurs and leads to poor oxidation resistance. In 950-PreO treated superalloy, since the continuous CoCr2O4 and Al2O3 scales help to reduce the diffusion of oxygen and the metal elements, the mass gain of 950-PreO treated superalloy is consequently decreased. During the hot corrosion process, the preoxide layer of 950-PreO treated superalloy can hinder the diffusion of corrosive medium. Therefore, the corrosion resistance can be significantly improved by 950-PreO treatment, and the mass gain is decreased by over 80%.

TI The Co-Ti system revisited: About the cubic-to-hexagonal Laves phase
   transformation and other controversial features of the phase diagram
SO CALPHAD-COMPUTER COUPLING OF PHASE DIAGRAMS AND THERMOCHEMISTRY
AB The Co-Ti system is one of the important systems for the development of Co-based superalloys and it is the only binary Co-X system where the characteristic, fine-scaled gamma/gamma' microstructures (fcc-Co with fcc L1(2)-ordered TiCo3) can form. Surprisingly, the phase relations and invariant reaction temperatures in the Co-rich part of the system are not very well established and there are fundamental inconsistencies between different versions of the phase diagram. Crucial points such as the type of formation reaction of the gamma' phase TiCo3 from the melt are unclear. The system is not only of high scientific interest because of the presence of the gamma/gamma' microstructure, but also due to the occurrence of two different, stable polytypes of the Laves phase TiCo2 (hexagonal C36 and cubic C15 type). The phase fields of these two polytypes should be separated by a two-phase field the existence of which however has never been clearly proven. A re-investigation of the Co-rich part of the phase diagram (0-50 at.% Ti) including all invariant reactions as well as the liquidus, solidus, and solvus lines was performed by not only making use of equilibrated alloys but also applying diffusion couples.

TI MICROSTRUCTURE, HARDNESS AND INTERFACIAL ENERGY IN Co-9Al-10W-xNi (x=15,
   25, 35 at. %) ALLOYS DURING AGING
SO JOURNAL OF MINING AND METALLURGY SECTION B-METALLURGY
AB In the present paper, three Co-Al-W-Ni alloys (i.e., Co-9Al-10W-xNi with x= 15, 25, 35 at. %) and their heat treatment mechanisms were carefully designed on the basis of the available phase equilibrium information. The temporal evolution of the microstructure and hardness in the Co-9Al-10W-xNi ( x= 15, 25, 35) alloys during aging process was measured, from which the effect of additional Ni contents, aging temperature and time on microstructure and hardness in the three Co-Al-W-Ni alloys was analyzed. Considering that the alloy compositions and heat treatment are not directly related with the hardness, the relationship between hardness and microstructure was then linked. It was found that the hardness of Co-based superalloys increases as the volume fraction of gamma' precipitates increases, while decreases with the increase of the radius and interval of gamma' precipitates. Moreover, the interfacial energy of gamma/gamma' interface was also evaluated on the basis of the coarsening kinetics of gamma' precipitates and the Philippe-Voorhees model in combination with the thermodynamic and atomic mobility databases. The results indicate that the interfacial energies of gamma/gamma' interface reduce as the increase of additional Ni content and aging temperature.

AB Low-cycle fatigue behavior of two superalloys, ULTIMET(R) alloy, Co-26 pct Cr-9 pct Ni (wt pct), and HAYNES(R) HR-120(R) alloy, Ni-33 pct Fe-25 pct Cr, was studied at room temperature. An infrared thermography system was employed to monitor the temperature evolution of fatigue processes for both superalloys. Temperature changes during fatigue were related to the hysteresis effect, and were successfully predicted, based on the consideration of the hysteresis effect and heat conduction. The temperature increase of a specimen from the initial to the equilibrium stages was used as an index to predict the fatigue life of the two superalloys. It was found that the fatigue-life predictions using the present model were in good agreement with the experimental results.

AB The primary microstructure of new Co-based superalloy of Co-20Ni-7Al-7W (at.%) type was showed in this article. The alloy was manufactured by induction melting in vacuum furnaces. This alloy is a part of new group of high-temperature materials based on Co solid solution and strengthened by coherent L1(2) phase similar to Ni-based superalloys with gamma' phase. The final form of Co-ss/L1(2) microstructure is obtained after fully heat treatment included homogenization, solutionizing and aging processes. But first step of heat treatment thermal parameters determination is characterization of primary microstructure of alloys after casting process with special attentions on segregations of alloying elements in solid solution and presences of structural elements such as eutectic areas, and other phases precipitations. In analysed case the relatively high homogeneity of chemical composition was expected especially in the case of W distribution, what was confirmed be SEM/EDS analysis in dendritic and interdendritic areas.

SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB The effects of Ta and Ti on the microstructure, segregation and solidification path of Co-7A1-8W-base alloy were investigated using directional solidification quenching experiments and isothermal solidification quenching experiments. The results showed that the as-cast microstructure of the Co-7Al-8W alloy (Base alloy) is the gamma single phase. The Al element slightly segregates to the interdendritic regions, the W element slightly segregates to the dendritic core, and Co has almost no segregation. The solidification path of the Co-7Al-8W-4Ti alloy is L -> L-1+gamma -> L-2+gamma+(beta+gamma')(e) -> L-3+gamma+(beta+gamma')(e)+gamma'->gamma+(beta+gamma')(e)+gamma', After the addition of 1 at.% Ti, there is no change in the segregation of elements, the microstructure and the solidification path of the alloy. The Ta element strongly segregates to the interdendritic regions in the Co-7Al-8W-1Ta alloy. With the addition of 4 at.% Ti, the Ti element strongly segregates to the interdendritic regions, and the segregation of Al and W elements increases. Blocky gamma' phase and (beta+y')(e) eutectics form in the interdendritic regions. The solidification path of the Co-7Al-8W-4Ti alloy is L -> L-1+gamma -> L-2+gamma+(beta+Y')(e) -> L-3+gamma+(beta+gamma')(e)+gamma' ->gamma+(beta+gamma')(e)+y', After the addition of 1 at.% Ta+4 at.% Ti, the segregation of Al, Ta and Ti decreases, while the segregation of W increases. Laves phase, blocky gamma' phase and ((beta+y')e eutectics form in the interdendritic regions. The solidification path of the Co-7A1-8W-1Ta-4Ti alloy is L -> L-1+gamma -> L-2+gamma+Laves -> L-3+gamma+Laves+(beta+gamma')(e) -> L-4+gamma+Laves+(beta+gamma')(e)+gamma' -> gamma+Laves+(beta+gamma')(e)+gamma'. The above results could provide an experimental basis for composition optimization and solidification process control of novel gamma'-strengthened Co-base superalloys. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB First-principles DFT methods are combined with an experimental approach to characterize the creep behavior of quinary Co-based L1(2)-containing superalloys at elevated temperature conditions. Temperature-dependent SISF energies have been modeled, combining 0 K formation energies with vibrational free energy calculations to assess deformation mechanisms at finite temperature. Two different Co-Al-W alloys, containing the maximum possible amount of DFT-identified d-block alloying additions, were identified and cast as single crystals via the Bridgman process. Creep tests have been performed at two primary testing conditions, one at 900 degrees C and the other at 982 degrees C. Transmission scanning electron microscopy (TSEM) was performed at 30 kV in a scanning electron microscope to rapidly characterize the defect substructures. We observe a coupled APB/SISF/APB defect structure in Co-based superalloys at the low-temperature condition, similar to the defect structure observed in CoNi, in spite of containing no Ni. At 982 degrees C, there is no evidence of faults and precipitates instead contain antiphase boundaries. The role of composition and temperature-dependent fault energies in the deformation process is addressed.

SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Up to now gamma' phase in superalloys is always analyzed in electrolytes with oxygen-hearing anion in transpassive dissolution potential range. It is based on the difference of transpassive behavior between 'gamma' phase and gamma matrix, which is caused from the difference of chromium contents between toth phases. So the electrolytic extraction of gamma' phase from chromium-free superalloys by traditional methods is very difficult. In this paper, a new galvanostatic electrolysis method is developed succesefully for the quantitative extraction of gamma' phase from the 10% NH4Cl + 2% citric acid solution in active dissolution range[about- 200 mV(SCE)].

TI Measurement of the densities of nickel-based ternary, quaternary and
   commercial alloys
SO MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS
AB The modified sessile drop method (MSDM) and the modified pycnometric method (MPM) have been employed to measure precisely the densities of liquid nickel-based ternary (Ni-Co-Al) and quaternary (Ni-Co-Al-Cr, Ni-Co-Al-Mo, Ni-Cr-Al-Mo) alloys and four commercial superalloys in liquid and mushy states. There was a good agreement between the values measured by the two methods. The measured densities of liquid model alloys and commercial superalloys in liquid and mushy states decreased linearly with increasing temperature for the experimental temperature range. The temperature coefficient of the density of liquid ternary Ni-Co-Al alloys measured in this work can be represented as a quadratic function of the aluminium concentration in the alloys. The density of liquid Ni-Co-Al alloys can be expressed as a function of both temperature and aluminium concentration in the alloys. The recommended equations for the densities of liquid nickel-based ternary and quaternary alloys and four commercial superalloys in liquid and mushy states were obtained by analysing density values measured by both MSDM and MPM. The calculated values from the recommended density equations show good agreement with those measured by both MSDM and MPM.

TI Phase stability and yield stress of Ni-base superalloys containing high
   Co and Ti
SO METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND
   MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Ni-base superalloys containing high Co (> 20 wt pet) and Ti (> 5.5 wt pet) were designed in order to study the effects of Co16.9 wt pet Ti addition on phase stability and mechanical property. These new alloys, though they contained high Ti, mainly consisted of gamma and gamma' phases. Ni3Ti (eta) phase was observed along the grain boundaries in some of the alloys. The formation of eta phase was mainly related to the Ti/Al ratio, Ti content, and alloy composition. Tensile and compression tests showed that these new alloys exhibited higher yield stress than that of the baseline alloy, TMW-1(U720LI). The possible strengthening mechanisms were discussed in terms of solid-solution and precipitation strengthening effects by the Co16.9 wt pet Ti additions. Preliminary results show promising trends for the development of new superalloys for turbine disc applications.

TI High temperature properties and fatigue strength of novel wrought
   gamma/gamma' Co-base superalloys
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS RESEARCH
AB This paper presents the high temperature yield and fatigue strength as well as thermophysical properties of two polycrystalline wrought gamma/gamma' Co-base superalloys developed for application in a temperature regime above 700 degrees C. The alloys CoW Alloy1 (Co42Ni32Cr12Al6W3Ti2.5Ta1.5 1 Si,C,B,Zr,Hf) and CoW Alloy2 (Co41Ni32Cr12Al9W5 1 Ti,Ta,Si,C,B,Zr,Hf) exhibited solidus temperatures of 1070 degrees C and 1030 degrees C, respectively, and a gamma' fraction of about 50%. CoW Alloy2 displayed a rather high Young's modulus of 250 GPa. The two Co-base superalloys showed a good high temperature strength exceeding Ni-base disc alloys U720Li and Waspaloy at temperatures above 800 degrees C. When comparing the yield strength from tensile and compression tests, no asymmetry could be found. The low-cycle fatigue life of CoW Alloy2 at a total strain amplitude of 0.5% is similar to that of U720Li and Waspaloy (about 370 cycles, R = -1). During long-term aging for 1024 h at 750 degrees C, no additional phases were formed and the room temperature hardness barely changed.

TI High-strength Co-Al-V-base superalloys strengthened by gamma
   '-Co-3(Al,V) with high solvus temperature
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB The gamma/gamma' two-phase Co Al V-base superalloys are investigated in detail, including their phase equilibria, alloying effects, and alloy design. The experimental proof of the existence of a ternary compound with an L1(2)-ordered gamma'-Co-3(Al, V) phase is provided in this study, and the gamma/gamma' two-phase Co-5Al-14V (at.%) alloy is designed. The gamma'-Co-3(Al,V) phase is proved to be thermodynamically stable at 900 degrees C, and a wide gamma/gamma' two-phase composition region in the Co-Al-V ternary phase diagram at 900 degrees C is identified. The performed investigation of Co-5Al-14V-2X (X: Ti, Cr, Nb, Mo, Ta, and W) and Co-xNi-8Al-12V (x = 10, 20, and 30) quaternary alloys revealed that Ti, Nb, Mo, Ta, W, and Ni tend to concentrate in the gamma' phase, whereas Cr tends to partition to the gamma matrix. Besides, the gamma/gamma' two-phase Co-30Ni-10Al-5V-4Ta-2Ti (30Ni4Ta2Ti) alloy is designed. The 30Ni4Ta2Ti alloy exhibits a very high gamma' solvus temperature (namely, 1242 +/- 3 degrees C) combined with a low density (8.46 +/- 0.08 g cm(-3)), which characteristics are comparable with those of the Mar-M-247 Ni-base superalloy. Moreover, the nominal and the specific yield strength values of the obtained 30Ni4Ta2Ti alloy within the temperature range from 600 to 900 degrees C are also close to those of the Mar-M-247 superalloy.

AB Alloy 903 and Alloy 909 are well-known Fe-Co-Ni-Al-Ti-Nb alloys with controlled low thermal expansion, but they have some properties that can be improved. To improve stress-accelerated grain boundary oxidation embrittlement of Alloy 903 and instability of the gamma' phase of alloy 909, two new alloys with good stress-rupture ductility, high creep-rupture strength, high tensile strength at high temperature, and good controlled thermal expansion were developed. These property improvements were accomplished by the combination of optimizing the Fe-Co-Ni ratio of the matrix and stabilizing the gamma' phase with the addition of aluminum.

TI MICROSTRUCTURES AND PARTITIONING RATIOS OF ALLOYING ELEMENTS IN RHENIUM
   CONTAINING NICKEL-BASED SINGLE-CRYSTAL SUPERALLOYS
SO TETSU TO HAGANE-JOURNAL OF THE IRON AND STEEL INSTITUTE OF JAPAN
AB In order to obtain some criteria for determining the optimum compositions of rhenium (Re) containing nickel-based single crystal superalloys, the phase stability and the partition ratios of alloying elements between gamma and gamma' phases were investigated using the Ni-10Cr-12Al-1.2Ti-2.6Ta-2.0W-0.7Mo-0 approximately 1Re (mol%) alloys.  Most of Re atoms were found to be distributed mainly in the gamma phase and alter significantly the partition ratios of the other elements between gamma and gamma' phases.  It was shown that the decrease of Cr, Ta, W, Mo contents and the increase of Al content were most desirable in the design of alloys containing more than 0.25 mol% Re.  Further, in order to investigate the possibility Co addition into the Re containing alloys, its effects on the phase stability and the partition ratios of elements were examined with the Ni-10Cr-12Al-1.5Ti-2.1Ta-2.3W-0.8Mo-0.25Re (mol%) alloys in which 0 approximately 9 mol% Co was substituted for Ni.  It became evident from the present experiment that the Co substitution for Ni did not induce any large changes in the phase stability and also in the partition ratios of the alloying elements in this system.

AB Components of gas turbines need to be extremely resistant to elevated temperatures and stresses, corrosion, and erosive environments. The materials used under these environmental conditions are primarily cobalt-based superalloys. In this study, the low cycle fatigue of a cobalt-based superalloy, FSX-414, was examined. The total strain ranges of a gas turbine operating between 760 degrees C and 870 degrees C were considered the parameters representing actual gas turbine operation. In addition, fatigue tests were performed using a trapezoidal waveform to reflect the operation and stop conditions of a gas turbine with frequent shutdowns. The fatigue test results were compared with results obtained using the Manson-Coffin method and the energy method. The fractured surface was analyzed using a scanning electron microscope(SEM).

TI Elemental site occupancy in the L1(2) A(3)B ordered intermetallic phase
   in Co-based superalloys and its influence on the microstructure
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB We explore the effects of the elemental site occupancy in gamma'-A3B (L1(2)) intermetallic phases and their partitioning across the gamma/gamma' interface in a class of multicomponent W-free Co-based superalloys. Atom probe tomography and first principles density functional theory calculations (DFT) were used to evaluate the Cr site occupancy behavior in the gamma' phase and its effect on the gamma/gamma' partitioning behavior of other solutes in a series of Co-30Ni-10Al-5Mo-2Ta-2Ti-XCr alloys, where x is 0, 2, 5, and 8 at.% Cr, respectively. The increase in Cr content from 0 to 2 to 5 at.% leads to an inversion of the partitioning behavior of the solute Mo from the gamma' phase (K-Mo > 1) into the gamma matrix (K-Mo < 1). At 5 at.% Cr, the Cr also has a preference to replace the excess anti-site Co atoms from the B-sites. At 8 at.% Cr, the Cr develops an additional preference to replace Co atoms from the A-sites. These compositional changes in the phases and the site partitioning behavior in the gamma' phase are accompanied by an overall decrease in the lattice misfit (delta) across the gamma/gamma' interfaces as measured by high-resolution X-ray diffraction at room temperature. The reduction in misfit triggers a change in morphology of the gamma' phase from cuboidal (delta similar to +0.48% at 0 at.% Cr) to round-cornered (delta similar to +0.34% at 5 at.% Cr) to spheroidal shaped (delta similar to +0.19% at 8 at.% Cr) precipitates. We also observed an increase in the solvus temperature from 1066 degrees C to 1105 degrees C when adding 5 at.% Cr to the alloy. These results on the effects of Cr in Co-base superalloys enable tuning the microstructure of these alloys and widening the alloy spectrum for designing improved high temperature alloys.

SO ADVANCED ENGINEERING MATERIALS
AB The influence of iridium on the phase stability, oxidation behavior, and high temperature creep strength of -hardened Co-base superalloys is discussed. Ir increases the -solvus temperature and -volume fraction since it partitions slightly to the -phase. However, Ir leads also to a discontinuous precipitation transformation of the metastable /-microstructure into a lamellar microstructure of Co3W, CoAl, and a Co-rich fcc phase for the W-rich alloys. A reduction of W in presence of Ir leads to a higher phase stability. The constrained lattice misfit between the and phase in the Ir and high W containing alloy is +0.5%. The alloying element Ir strongly increases the creep strength at 850 degrees C as long as the /-microstructure is not discontinuously transformed. Furthermore, the oxidation resistance is improved by the addition of iridium.

   Addition
SO METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND
   MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Microstructural features, including gamma' volume fraction and size, gamma-gamma' lattice misfit, gamma channel width, and dislocation substructure, are known to significantly influence the creep performance in Ni-base single-crystal superalloys. In this study, the microstructural characteristics of Ru-containing single-crystal superalloys with different levels of Co, Mo, and Ru additions were quantitatively investigated after ruptured and interrupted creep tests conducted at 1223 K (950 degrees C) and 400 MPa. The creep lifetime was slightly increased with the high level of Co addition and significantly increased with the coadditions of Mo and Ru. A minor effect of Co content on the gamma channel width and gamma' volume fraction was found in experimental alloys. The alloy with high levels of Mo and Ru additions was determined to possess a more negative gamma-gamma' lattice misfit, and a high density of stacking faults (SFs) was formed in the gamma channels during creep. The combined effects of the SFs in the gamma matrix serving as the barriers to dislocation movement, as well as the dense interfacial dislocation networks preventing dislocation to shear the gamma' phase, were considered as the main mechanism responsible for the improvement of creep resistance. Results from this study are helpful to understand the effect of microstructural features on creep performance and contribute to the knowledge of physical metallurgy in Ru-containing single-crystal superalloys.

TI Cobalt
SO JOURNAL OF TOXICOLOGY-CLINICAL TOXICOLOGY
AB Cobalt is a relatively rare magnetic element with properties similar to iron and nickel. The two valance states are cobaltous (II) and cobaltic (III) and the former is the most common valance used in the chemical industry. Cobalt occurs in nature primarily as arsenides, oxides, and sulfides. Most of the production of cobalt involves the metallic form used in the formation of cobalt superalloys. The term "hard metal" refers to compounds containing tungsten carbide (80-95 %) combined with matrices formed from cobalt (5-20%) and nickel (0-5 %). For the general population, the diet is the main source of exposure to cobalt. In the occupational setting, exposure to cobalt alone occurs primarily during the production of cobalt powders. In other industrial exposures (e.g., hard metal, diamond polishing), additional agents (tungsten) modulate the toxicity of cobalt. Cobalt is an essential element necessary for the formation of vitamin B-12 (hydroxocobalamin); however, excessive administration of this trace element produces goiter and reduced thyroid activity. In 1966, the syndrome "beer drinker's cardiomyopathy" appeared in Quebec City, Canada, and was characterized by pericardial effusion, elevated hemoglobin concentrations, and congestive heart failure. An interstitial pulmonary fibrosis has been associated with industrial exposure to hard metal dust (tungsten and cobalt), but not to cobalt alone. Exposure to cobalt alone produces an allergic contact dermatitis and occupational asthma. Treatment of cobalt toxicity is primarily supportive.

TI Effects of Re, W and Co on dislocation nucleation at the crack tip in
   the gamma-phase of Ni-based single-crystal superalloys by atomistic
   simulation
SO ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE
AB The effects of Re, W and Co on dislocation nucleation at the crack tip in Ni have been studied by the molecular dynamics method. The results show that the activation energy of dislocation nucleation is lowered by the addition of Re, W and Co; moreover, the activation energy decreases when the alloying element increases from 1 at.% to 2 at.%. The energy landscapes of the atoms are studied to elucidate these effects. Quantification analyses of the bonding strength between Ni and X (X = Re, W or Co) reveal that strong bonding between Ni and X (X = Re, W or Co) in the dislocation nucleation process can suppress the cleavage process and enhance the ability of dislocation nucleation. The surface energy and unstable stacking fault energy are also calculated to understand the alloying effects on the dislocation nucleation process. The results imply that interaction between alloying elements and Ni atoms plays a role in promoting the dislocation nucleation process at the crack tip. The ability of Re, W and Co in improving the ductility of the Ni crack system is in the order W. Re. Co. The results could provide useful information in the design of Ni-based superalloys.

AB The discovery of gamma'-Co-3(Al,W) opens up a pathway to exploit novel Co-Al-based alloys as candidates of the next generation of superalloys. Inspired by the unexpected finding of gamma'-Co-3(Al,W), we present a comprehensive investigation concerning the effect of alloying elements on phase stabilities and mechanical properties of Co3Al. Up to 22 transition metal elements, e.g. Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Y, Zr, Nb, Mo, Tc, Ru, Rh, Pd, Hf, Ta, W, Re, Os, Ir, and Pt are considered. Results show that W, Ti, Re, V, and Ta favor to occupy the Al-sublattice. Pd, Pt, Rh, Ni, It, Fe, and Ru favor to occupy the Co-sublattice. The others can occupy both the Co-and Al-sublattices. W, Ta, V, Ti, Nb, Re, Mo, Pt, and Cr are shown to stabilize Co3Al. It verifies that elastic properties are roughly in inverse proportional to the volume change induced by alloying elements within each group of 3d, 4d, or 5d. Based on the analysis of electronic configurations, the influence mechanism of alloying elements is traceable from the chemical bonding and the geometry of charge density. The present calculations are in favorable accord with available experimental data in the literature. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI THERMODYNAMIC STUDY ON EQUILIBRIUM PRECIPITATION PHASES IN A NOVEL Ni-Co
   BASE SUPERALLOY
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB Thermodynamic properties of the traditional U720Li alloy and the new Ni-Co base superalloy have been studied using JMatPro and the latest relevant database for Ni base superalloys. The effects of chemical composition on the equilibrium precipitation phases, process-ability and gamma/gamma' mismatch have been analyzed. It is found that the gamma/gamma' mismatch increases with the increase of Ti/Al (atomic ratio). The volume fraction of gamma' is proportional to the Ti+Al contents (atomic fraction). Therefore, by increasing the Ti/Al ratio and Ti+Al content, the yield strength of alloys can be improved. On the other hand, the gamma' solvus temperature decreases by Co additions. As a result, the range of processing temperature is extended. The gamma/gamma' mismatch also increases with Co additions, which adds additional strengthening to the alloy. Moreover, high Ti/Al ratio or low Co content promotes the precipitation of eta phase. Thus, Ni-Co base superalloys with high Ti+Al content, Ti/Al ratio and Co content bear an improved strength, phase stabilities and process-ability.

AB The current work characterizes the microstructure and mechanical properties of two arc melted Co-Ni-based superalloys containing in atomic percent: 1) Co-40Ni-10Al-7.5W-10Cr-3Ta-0.0613-0.6 C and 2) Co-40Ni-10Al-7.5W-10Cr-3Nb-0.0613-0.6 C. These two materials named 3Ta and 3Nb, respectively, were characterized by X-Ray diffraction analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy, electron backscatter diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. Furthermore, compression tests were performed from room temperature up to 1000 degrees C. The 3Ta and 3Nb alloys showed different as-cast microstructures that were confirmed by microstructural characterization and Scheil simulations. The phase transformation temperatures of minor phases were measured and calculated using a thermodynamic approach and some discrepancies observed on the calculated gamma'-solvus temperatures reflect that the thermodynamic description of gamma' phase does not take into account the strong partition effect of Ta, Nb and Ti into gamma'. As shown by DSC results, the gamma' phase was stable for both alloys up to 1000 degrees C, being the main reason for the 3Ta and 3Nb alloys to keep the yield stress above 500 MPa.

TI Codeposition of Co and Al on nickel base superalloys by pack cementation
   process
SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB To seek favorable conditions for the codeposition of Co and Al to form diffusion coatings on nickel base superalloys, the thermochemical analyses were adopted for a series of pack powder mixtures containing Co, Al, halide salts and Al2O3. The halide salts studied were AlF3 and NH4Cl. On the basis of the thermochemical calculations, the pack powder mixture of 7.6A1-20Co-4NR(4)Cl-68.4Al(2)O(3) (wt.%) activated by NH4Cl was formulated. The coatings had a two-layer structure, of which the outer layer was mainly composed of Al0.9Ni1.1 where a part of Ni was replaced by Co. Once this was achieved, a series of further experiments was undertaken to investigate the effects of deposition duration and temperature on the kinetics of coating growth process. It was observed that these parameters only affected the coating thickness. The parabolic relationship between the coating thickness and the deposition duration confirms that the process was mainly diffusion-controlled. The experimental results of the oxidation showed that the coating can prevent efficiently substrate from oxidizing. The excellent oxidation resistance was attributed to a continuous and compact alpha-Al2O3 film formed on the surface of sample. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Effect of high-temperature protective coatings on fatigue lives of
   nickel-based superalloys
SO FATIGUE & FRACTURE OF ENGINEERING MATERIALS & STRUCTURES
AB This study concerns MCrAlY coatings (M is Ni, Co or both) sprayed by a vacuum plasma spraying process for protection against high-temperature corrosion and oxidation of gas turbine components, such as turbine blades and duct segments. The effect of high-temperature protective coatings on fatigue lives of nickel-based superalloys were investigated at high temperature under push-pull loading and rotary bending and then compared with uncoated superalloys, such as equiaxed IN738LC, unidirectional solidified CM247LC and single-crystal CMSX-2. The high-cycle fatigue lives of MCrAlY-coated superalloys at high temperature under push-pull loading showed an inferior performance when compared with the uncoated superalloys. This was because the crack initiation site was different. The high-cycle fatigue cracks of nickel-based superalloys initiated at casting cavities which were exposed on the specimen surface, whereas the high-cycle fatigue cracks of MCrAlY-coated specimens initiated at interface defects, such as small pores and grid residue, between the MCrAlY coating and the substrate and grew into the MCrAlY coating, and then into the substrate. Similarly, the rotary bending fatigue properties of MCrAlY-coated superalloys at high temperature showed an inferior performance when compared with the uncoated superalloys. This is because of a high stress due to the higher Young's modulus of the MCrAlY coating (in comparison with the substrate) being induced at the MCrAlY coating surface. The crack initiation site was on the specimen surface in both cases of the nickel-based superalloys and the MCrAlY-coated superalloys, respectively. As a result, it was considered that, for rotary bending tests, the fatigue life reduction was due to the high stress that originated from the difference of elastic constants between the MCrAlY coating and the superalloy. Consequently, in fatigue life design it is necessary to take account of the stress levels in a coating layer.

TI Effect of multiple alloying additions on microstructural features and
   creep performance at 950 degrees C and 400 MPa in Ru-containing single
   crystal superalloys
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB Microstructural features, including gamma channel width, gamma' size, gamma' volume fraction, gamma-gamma' lattice misfit, TCP phase as well as dislocation substructures had influence on the creep performance in Ni-base single crystal superalloys. However, relatively limited work has been conducted to investigate the effect of microstructural features based on various alloying additions on creep properties in Ru-containing single crystal superalloys. In this study, the creep tests were conducted at 950 degrees C and 400 MPa in experimental alloys with different levels Co (7.0 wt% and 15.0 wt%), Cr (3.5 wt% and 6.0 wt%), Mo (1.0 wt% and 2.5 wt%) and Ru (2.5 wt% and 4.0 wt%) additions, and the microstructures during creep were characterized in detail. Co and Ru were found to decrease the gamma channel width, respectively. The high level of Cr addition decreased the gamma' volume fraction and promote the TCP phase formation during creep. The addition of Mo decreased the gamma channel width and also acted as a TCP former. The gamma-gamma' lattice misfit was increased to more negative by the individual additions of Co, Ru, Cr, and Mo, respectively. The joint addition of microstructural stabilizers Co and Ru inhibited the TCP phase formation during creep. The precipitation of TCP phases served as one of the main factor to decrease the creep property in alloys with high level of Cr and Mo additions, respectively. The synergistic effect of Mo and Ru additions in the alloy with high level of Co content was found to increase the gamma-gamma' lattice misfit and the amount of stacking faults in gamma matrix during creep process, which improved the creep resistance at 950 degrees C and 400 MPa. This study is helpful to understand the effect of alloying elements additions and microstructures on creep performance and to get better improvement of physical metallurgy knowledge and alloy design in Ru-containing single crystal superalloys.

AB The microstructure and corrosion behavior was studied for a Co modified NiAl coating formed on the superalloy DZ125 by pack cementation process. The hot corrosion kinetics showed that the mass gain of the coated specimen was three orders of magnitude lower than that of the uncoated specimen at 1173 K up to 100 h. The corrosion product formed on the surface of the coating mainly consisted of a protective alpha-Al2O3 film. The presence of Co in the coating could promote the establishment of a protective Al2O3 scale on the coating and restrain the internal diffusion of sulphur in the coating. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Long-term aging at 1000 degrees C for 1000 h revealed stable gamma-gamma' structure with 75% gamma ' volume fraction. The measured positive lattice misfit resulted in directional coarsening parallel to the applied stress during creep. The gamma-gamma' interfacial dislocation networks and shearing of gamma ' precipitates with stacking faults and antiphase boundaries appeared to contribute to the creep resistance with 1.0% creep stain. @ 2014 Acta Materialia Inc.

TI Influence of alloying elements on the elastic properties of ternary and

SO PHILOSOPHICAL MAGAZINE
AB Using new supercells, the influence of the alloying elements Co, Cr, Ta, Re, and Ru on the elastic properties of ternary and quaternary nickel-base superalloys are systematically studied by the first-principles pseudopotential method. The calculated results of the five ternary and three quaternary superalloys suggest that the alloying elements can increase the elastic moduli. Re is found to be most effective in increasing the moduli of ternary alloys. Among the quaternary alloys, the Ni-Al-Re-Ru system has the largest moduli. Our calculated values of the elastic moduli agree very well with the experimental results. The charge density redistribution and partial density of states are calculated for the quaternary system including both Re and Ru. Covalent-like bonding between Re and its nearest neighbor is observed. The hybridization between the Re-d orbital and the host Ni-p, d orbitals are the origin of the modulus strengthening effect.

TI A New Polycrystalline Co-Ni Superalloy
SO JOM
AB In 2006, a new-ordered L1(2) phase, Co-3(Al,W), was discovered that can form coherently in a face-centered cubic (fcc) A1 Co matrix. Since then, a community has developed that is attempting to take these alloys forward into practical applications in gas turbines. A new candidate polycrystalline Co-Ni gamma/gamma' superalloy, V208C, is presented that has the nominal composition 36Co-35Ni-15Cr-10Al-3W-1Ta (at.%). The alloy was produced by conventional powder metallurgy superalloy methods. After forging, a gamma' fraction of similar to 56% and a secondary gamma' size of 88 nm were obtained, with a grain size of 2.5 mu m. The solvus temperature was 1000 degrees C. The density was found to be 8.52 g cm(-3), which is similar to existing Ni alloys with this level of gamma'. The alloy showed the flow stress anomaly and a yield strength of 920 MPa at room temperature and 820 MPa at 800 degrees C, similar to that of Mar-M247. These values are significantly higher than those found for either conventional solution and carbide-strengthened Co alloys or the gamma/gamma' Co superalloys presented in the literature thus far. The oxidation resistance, with a mass gain of 0.08 mg cm(-2) in 100 h at 800 degrees C, is also comparable with that of existing high-temperature Ni superalloys. These results suggest that Co-based and Co-Ni superalloys may hold some promise for the future in gas turbine applications.

Estimating parameters like dislocation density and carbide spacing by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). the hot tensile, creep and relaxation behaviour has been connected with the evolution of microstructure. The results of mechanical tests and the TEM-investigations have been used as input data into two models (an effective stress model and a modified constitutive model by Kocks-Mecking). which describe the deformation behavior. The deterioration in the creep properties of the alloy NiCr22Co12Mo9 as a result of coating was a result both of the degraded state of the M23C6-precipitate in the substrate metal, and of the weakening of the solid solution- and precipitation hardening mechanisms responsible for the creep strength of the material. in the region of the boundary surface.

SO COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB The strengthening effects induced by alloying elements (Re, Ru, Cr, Co, Mor, W, Ta) on Ni/Ni3Al interface in single crystal Ni-based superalloys are investigated in terms of Griffith work using first-principles density functional theory. The best strengthening effect on Ni/Ni3Al interface can be attributed to Re, and the elements W and Ta appear to be less potent with Co having little effect. This sequence of creep-strengthening effect of alloying elements obtained from our calculations is consistent with relevant experimental observations. The calculated Griffith works for more elements of transition metals indicate that elements near the centre of the d block of the periodic table are more favorable for improving the rupture strength than those from the far west and far east of the transition metal block.

SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB The solidification paths, microstructures and mechanical properties of two Co-Al-W base superalloys with different additions of tungsten and molybdenum were investigated. Mo addition does not influence the volume fraction of the gamma' phase; however, the morphology of the gamma' phase changes from cuboidal to near cuboidal. The mu phase and beta phase were identified in both alloy systems. Although the melting point of the mu phase is decreased by Mo addition, the solidification paths remain the same: L -> L-1 + gamma -> L-2 + gamma + mu -> gamma + mu + beta -> gamma + mu + beta + gamma' . The precipitation of a gamma' phase envelop around the interdendritic regions in Co-Al-W alloy systems has never been reported. The formation of a surrounding gamma' phase was caused by the diffusion of elements between secondary phases and the substrate during the heat treatments. The microhardness of the mu phase, which can be easily influenced by Mo addition, is the highest in both alloys, followed by the microhardnesses of the beta phase and the substrate. In the fracturing process, microcracks were generated in the mu phase, the number of which increased with Mo addition.

AB This paper presents recent progress on the phase diagrams and design for Co-base alloys, focusing on magnetic recording media, ferromagnetic Co-Ni-Al-base shape memory alloys, half-metallic Heusler alloys and Co-base superalloys. The calculated miscibility gap between ferromagnetic and paramagnetic states in the Co-X(X: Cr, Mo, W) systems has been found to agree well with the experimental results, strongly implying that the magnetic induced phase separation is responsible for the compositional heterogeneity in Co-base magnetic recording media. New ferromagnetic Co-Ni-Al shape memory alloys have also been developed based on phase diagrams, where the introduction of gamma(Al structure) to the beta(B2) matrix was found to drastically improve the ductility. The phase stability of half-metal Heusler Co-Cr base alloys is discussed in relation to the order-disorder transition, Curie temperature and the spin polarization ratio. Finally, the possibility of potent strengthening of Co-base superalloys by precipitation of the gamma'(L1(2)) phase is presented.

AB High speed machining is known as an advanced machining process increasingly used for modern materials such as nickel or cobalt based superalloys. Besides increasing productivity and accuracy, high cutting speed will also improve surface quality. This paper outlines modeling methodology applied to optimize cutting parameters during high speed milling in order to obtain a very good surface finish. The parameters taken into account were cutting speed, ming feed and axial depth of the cut. These parameters are easy to controll and improvements can be made without mosts, simply by setting them at optimal values. For economic reasons, in order to solve the problem with minimum umber of trials, a centered composite experiment design was used. Experiment results of surface roughness measurements after high speed end milling of cobalt based superalloy FSX 414 with Ti coated carbide tools are resented. A predictive model was obtained after analyzing with ANOVA the influence of cutting parameters on surface roughness. The predictive model - well correlated with experimental data- shows that surface roughness does not depend on axial depth and is mostly influenced by feed rate. Cutting speed must be increased and cutting feed decreased to obtain a lower surface roughness Ra.

TI The Effect of Volatilisation of Refractory Metal Oxides on the Cyclic
   Oxidation of Ni-base Superalloys
SO OXIDATION OF METALS
AB The role of refractory metals on the bare oxidation behaviour of a range of compositionally complex single crystal Ni-base superalloys has been investigated using a range of techniques. It has been shown that this series of fourth generation alloys were borderline alumina formers at 1,100 A degrees C, and their cyclic oxidation performance was detrimentally affected by increased levels of Mo and Co. In addition, there was strong evidence that Re, Ru and Mo were lost through the process of cyclic oxidation, which supports the hypothesis that these elemental additions were lost through volatilisation/sublimation, contributing to their poor cyclic oxidation performance.

TI On the compatibility of single crystal superalloys with a thermal
   barrier coating system
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB The compatibility of three Co-containing prototype single crystal nickel-based superalloys with a thermal barrier coating (TBC) system is examined. These contain 2.1, 8.4 and 12.6 at.% Co; the concentrations of At, Cr, Ta, W, Re, Hf are identical and chosen to be representative of advanced grades of these alloys. The TBC consists of an yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) layer formed by electron beam physical vapour deposition (EB-PVD) and a bond coat made by electrodeposited platinum with a subsequent interdiffusion heat treatment - a so-called 'platinum-diffused' bond coat. The resistance to spallation of the TBC system is degraded as the Co content of the substrate increases. Wavelength-dispersive X-ray analysis and secondary ion mass spectrometry indicate that quantities of Co are present in the thermally grown oxide (TGO) by the time that failure occurs, this effect being most pronounced when the Co content of the substrate is high; the TGO is then more wavy and convoluted. The bond coat consists exclusively of the gamma and gamma' phases, with the balance shifting towards gamma with increasing thermal exposure; the loss of At from the bond coat due to TGO formation means that the TGO is eventually in contact with the gamma phase solely, which is enriched in Co.

TI Thermodynamic calculations for studying high temperature oxidation of
   superalloys
SO CALPHAD-COMPUTER COUPLING OF PHASE DIAGRAMS AND THERMOCHEMISTRY
AB Microstructure phenomena resulting from high temperature oxidation of a simple nickel alloy and two cobalt-base superalloys were studied by rnicrostructure examinations and thermodynamic calculations. The latter allowed to better quantify what happened to carbon during oxidation, which was not possible with microstructure examination and microanalysis alone, and to explain the microstructure changes due to oxidation. At 1000 degreesC, due to the Cr oxidation, the grain boundary carbides dissolve and the carbon diffuses inwards, where new carbides form. However, at 1100 and 1200 degreesC, the carbon diffuses outwards to the surface. Thermodynamic calculations were used to explain the seemingly different mechanisms of carbon diffusion.

SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB The influence of high temperature aging treatment on room temperature tensile properties of wrought nickel-base superalloys Alloy 617 and Haynes 230 was investigated. A significant decrease in elongation was observed for Alloy 617 exposed to a heavily oxidizing and decarburizing condition because of coarsening of grain boundary carbides and extensive inter-granular oxidation. On the other hand, Haynes 230 showed much lower ductility when exposed to a heavily carburizing condition, especially at 1000 degrees C because extensive carburization occurred due to a reaction with tungsten. Considerable loss of ductility for Alloy 617 and Haynes 230 was also observed in He-H-2-H2O-CO-CO2-CH4 and He-H2O-CO-CO2 environments, which were the slightly oxidizing and decarburizing conditions. Loss of ductility was predominantly associated with brittle inter-granular cracking, while the extent of loss of ductility decreased depending on the decarburization depth. Decarburization was observed more extensively in helium with H-2-H2O-CO-CO2-CH4 than helium with H2O-CO-CO2, and for Alloy 617 than for Haynes 230. Finally, the role of H-2 in accelerating decarburization is discussed. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved,

   model the yield strength of nickel-base superalloys
SO ISIJ INTERNATIONAL
AB The abilities of artificial neural networks and Gaussian processes to model the yield strength of nickel-base superalloys as a function of composition and temperature have been compared on the basis of simple well-known metallurgical trends (influence of Ti, Al, Co, Mo, W, Ta, of the Ti/Al ratio, gamma' volume fraction and the testing temperature). The methodologies are found to give similar results, and are able to predict the behaviour of materials that were not shown to the models during their creation. The Gaussian process modelling method is the simpler method to use, but its computational cost becomes larger than that of neural networks for large data sets.

AB In the present work, thermodynamic modelling of the high temperature oxidation behaviour of a gamma'-strengthened Co-base superalloy is presented. The ternary Co-9Al-9W alloy (values in at%) was isothermally oxidised for 500 h at 800 and 900 degrees C in air. Results reveal that the calculated oxide layer sequence (Thermo-Calc, TCNI6) is in good agreement with the formed oxide scales on the alloy surface. Furthermore, prediction of the influence of oxygen partial pressure on Al2O3 formation is presented. The modelling results indicate pathways for alloy development or possible pre-oxidation surface treatments for improved oxidation resistance of the material. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

SO INTERMETALLICS
AB Effects of alloying element-content on equilibrium segregation at and adjacent to the (100) gamma/gamma' interface in Ni-base superalloys were analyzed by using the cluster variation method incorporated with tetrahedron approximation and the phenomenological Lennard-Jones potential. Results suggest that Al-site occupiers in the gamma' phase such as Mo, Re and W were enriched near the interface on the side of the gamma phase. On the other hand, Co, which prefers to substitute for Ni site, exhibited minimal segregation in the gamma phase. The enrichment of the refractory elements such as Mo, Re and W around the interface was moderated, because Co addition slightly diluted refractory elements throughout the gamma phase.

TI Oxidation mechanism of cobalt based alloy at high temperatures (800-1100
   degrees C)
SO CORROSION ENGINEERING SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB A cobalt based Phynox alloy has been oxidised in the 800-1100 degrees C temperature range. Kinetic results show that the parabolic behaviour is followed under isothermal conditions. The scale growth mechanism of cobalt based Phynox alloy in air is consistent with a growth mechanism limited by the diffusion process in a growing Cr2O3 oxide scale. Thermal cycling tests show that the best scale adherence is found at 1000 degrees C. This temperature permits a rapid chromium supply from the substrate to form a continuous chromia scale. A keying effect at the internal interface is promoted by the presence of silicon and molybdenum. At 900 degrees C, CoCr2O4 cobalt containing oxide formation is favoured and leads to a bad scale adherence. At 1100 degrees C, thermal cycling conditions lead to scale spallation and chromium depletion. Then, important weight losses are registered corresponding to the oxidation of cobalt and molybdenum to induce CoCr2O4 and CoMoO4 formation.

   behavior of aluminized nickel-base single crystal superalloys
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB The influences of ruthenium and surface orientation on creep behavior of aluminized Ni-base single crystal superalloys were investigated by comparing two different types of NKH superalloys. The aluminized coated specimens were then subjected to creep rupture tests at a temperature of 900 degrees C and a stress of 392 MPa. The coating treatment resulted in a significant decrease in creep rupture lives for both superalloys. The diffusion zones between the coating and substrate led to changes in microstructure, which diminished the creep behavior of the aluminized superalloys. Because of the interdiffusion of Ru, Al and Ni, the solubility of some of the refractory elements, such as W, Re. Mo, Co and Cr decreased in the diffusion zone; the precipitation of topologically close-packed (TCP) phases was thus inevitable. In the present study, the addition of Ru increased the degree of Re and Cr supersaturation in the gamma matrix. Consequently, the addition of Ru indirectly promoted the precipitation of TCP phases in aluminized Ni-base single crystal superalloys. Furthermore, the growth of TCP precipitates was greatly influenced by the specific surface orientations of the Ni-base single crystal superalloys. In conclusion, the {110} specimens showed shorter creep rupture life than the {100} specimens, this was due to the difference in the crystallographic geometry of {111}< 101 > slip system and TCP precipitates between the two side-surface orientations of the specimens.

TI Reactions of Co based and Fe based superalloys with a molten Zn-Al alloy
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Static corrosion tests of Co based and Fe based superalloys were carried out at 470degreesC in a molten Zn galvanising alloy containing about 0(.)22 wt.-%Al and saturated with Fe for various lengths of time up to 168 h (one-week). The superalloys readily reacted with the galvanising alloy and CoAl or Fe2Al5 formed initially on the sample surfaces. The reaction front moved towards the depth of the test pieces with increasing dipping time, leaving behind a Zn rich reaction zone. At the same time, other intermetallic phases formed in the Zn rich zone and on the surfaces of the samples. These intermetallic phases are complex in nature and vary with the alloys. In Stellite 6, Fe aluminide was prominently present in the vicinity of surviving carbide particles in the Zn rich zone of the sample tested for 168 h. Some areas of iron aluminide were intimately connected to Fe2Al5 particles building up on the sample surface. This observation suggests that the iron aluminide formed in the reaction zone provided ideal sites for the attachment of Fe2Al5 particles pre-existing in the melt onto the sample surfaces. It also served as nucleation and growth sites for the (FeAl5)-Al-2 compound on the sample surface. This is one possible mechanism of dross buildup on submerged hardware made of this type of Co based superalloy in continuous galvanising.

AB New gamma/gamma' Co-based alloys appear to be a promising set of materials for use in the hottest parts of gas turbines. Recent work has shown that these alloys behave similar to conventional Ni-based superalloys and preliminary designs have produced alloys with remarkable strength at high temperatures. Understanding the behavior of solute elements in these alloys is essential for improving their properties and designing viable alloys. In this work, ab initio simulations are used to study the effects of additional elements on fault energies in the gamma' phase. Initial investigation shows that both Ta and Ti retain a strong preference for the second sub-lattice in the gamma' phase. Calculations also show that these elements increase the superlattice intrinsic stacking fault energy of the gamma' precipitates while promoting the stability of the gamma' phase relative to other crystal structures. This work indicates that the stability and resistance to dislocation penetration of the gamma' phase in these alloys are closely linked and are strongly affected by chemical bonding rather than the size of solute atoms.

AB This study examines the performance of a new class of wear-resistant but economical cutting tools produced by varying the binder composition of standard cemented carbide composites. By replacing some or all of the cobalt binder with rhenium and nickel-based superalloy, a stronger composite tool results, potentially capable of machining heat-resistant superalloys at significantly higher cutting speeds. Sample tools with alternative binder were produced and compared to standard tools bound with cobalt only. Turning experiments on Inconel 718 were run to evaluate wear resistance and tool life for several grades. The experimentation also examined the effects of varying the relative proportions of each binder constituent as well as the overall binder percentage in the composite. Results show a clear advantage of the alternative binder tools as evidenced by a 150% increase in tool life or the equivalent of an 18% increase in cutting speed. Although increasing amounts of rhenium in the binder show a positive effect on performance, the effects of superalloy and overall binder % are inconclusive.

TI Influence of hot isostatic pressing on the fracture transitions in the
   fine grain MAR-M247 superalloys
SO MATERIALS CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
AB The application of hot isostatic pressing (HIP) on the fine grain MAR-M247 superalloys was investigated for obtaining superior mechanical behaviors. The as-cast samples with grain sizes ranging from 70 to 90 mum were prepared using the fine grain process by varying overheating casting temperatures. Part of test bars was preceded with HIP for comparison. The tensile tests were carried out at elevated temperatures and the fracture morphologies were observed using scanning electron microscopy. The experimental results show that the tensile strengths and elongations of the as-cast fine grain MAR-M247 superalloys are deteriorated due to the presence of microporosity resulting from the liquid metal solidification and contraction. The microporosity can be eliminated by HIP and the tensile strengths and elongations are significantly improved. Nevertheless, the yield strengths of the fine grain MAR-M247 superalloys after HIP decreases because of the formation of coarsened gamma' phase at high temperature and high pressure during HIP. On the other hand, the mechanical behaviors at elevated temperatures are degraded due to the growth of gamma' precipitates around 760degreesC. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Low Temperature Hot Corrosion Screening of Single Crystal Superalloys
SO MATERIALS
AB Single crystal superalloys were screened in Type II molten (Na,K)-sulfate hot corrosion re-coat tests in air +300 ppm SO2 at 700 degrees C. They exhibited large 20-40 mg/cm(2) weight changes, repeated spallation, and non-protective, 25-50 m thick corrosion layers after 300 h of testing. Scale cross sections revealed dual outer Ni(Co)O and inner Al(Cr)S-rich corrosion layers. This chemical differentiation was partially consistent with previous models of oxide fluxing, alloy sulfidation, NiO micro-channel diffusion, and synergistic dissolution mechanisms. Broad shallow pits or uniform attack morphologies were consistent with prior studies performed in high >100 ppm pSO(2) environments. Higher Mo experimental alloys trended toward more degradation, producing 100 m thick scales with distinct Al(Cr)S-rich inner layers or 500 m thick NiO. The aggressive behavior in these environments supports the need for LTHC-resistant coatings for single crystal superalloys.

TI Segregation at stacking faults within the gamma ' phase of two Ni-base
   superalloys following intermediate temperature creep
SO SCRIPTA MATERIALIA
AB Using state-of-the-art energy dispersive spectroscopy, it has been established for the first time that there exists significant compositional variation (enrichment of Co and Cr and deficiency of Ni and Al) associated with superlattice intrinsic stacking faults created in the ordered gamma' precipitates following intermediate temperature deformation of two commercial superalloys. The results indicate that long range diffusion of these elements is intimately involved in the precipitate shearing process and is therefore closely linked to the time-dependent deformation of the alloys.

SO METALLURGICAL TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB As the first step to design and develop the new hot corrosion-resistant nickel-base single-crystal superalloys by the d-electrons alloy design theory (or the New PHACOMP), an evaluation of the phase stability of the modified hot corrosion-resistant IN738LC nickel-base superalloys (Ni-16Cr-9.5Al-4.0Ti-8.0-Co-0.55Nb-0.06Zr-0.05B-0.47C-(0 approximately 3)Ta-(0 approximately 3)W-(0 approximately 3)Mo (in atomic percent)) was conducted with the alloy design theory. The critical conditions for suppressing the precipitation of the brittle sigma phase can be described by the electronic parameters MdtBAR less-than-or-equal-to 0.991 and MdgammaBAR less-than-or-equal-to 0.93 which can be applied to the d-electrons alloy design of hot corrosion resistant nickel-base superalloys with high Cr contents.

TI Probing the crystallography of ordered Phases by coupling of orientation
   microscopy with atom probe tomography
SO ULTRAMICROSCOPY
AB The determination of atomic scale structural and compositional information using atom probe tomography is currently limited to elemental solids and dilute alloys. In the present article, a unique coupling of orientation microscopy and atom probe tomography successfully facilitates the crystallographic study of non-dilute alloy systems, with high evaporation fields. This reproducible methodology affords a new perspective to the conventional atom probe tomography of ordered precipitate strengthened superalloys. The high accuracy in crystallographic site-specific sample preparation results in high spatial resolution in APT, which has been demonstrated in Co-base superalloys. The practical applications of this technique can be extended to accurately characterize the nature of buried order/disorder interfaces at the atomic scale, as well as the site occupancies associated with different solute atoms in multi-component superalloys.

TI Phase Formation and Oxidation Behavior at 500 degrees C in a Ni-Co-Al
   Thin-Film Materials Library
SO ACS COMBINATORIAL SCIENCE
AB The complete ternary system Ni-Co-Al was fabricated as a thin film materials library by combinatorial magnetron sputtering and was annealed subsequently in several steps in Ar and under atmospheric conditions at 500 degrees C. Ni-Co-Al is the base system for both Ni- and Co-based superalloys. Therefore, the phases occurring in this system and their oxidation behavior is of high interest. The Ni-Co-Al materials library was investigated using high-throughput characterization methods such as optical measurements, resistance screening, automated EDX, automated XRD, and XPS. From the obtained data a thin film phase diagram for the Ni-Co-Al system in its state after annealing at 500 degrees C in air was established. Furthermore, a surface oxide composition map of the full Ni-Co-Al system for oxidation at 500 degrees C was concluded. As a result, it could be shown that at 500 degrees C an amount of 10 at. % Al is necessary for a Ni-Co-Al thin film to produce a protective Al-oxide scale.

TI High Temperature Corrosion Behavior of Superficially Applied CeO2 on
   Some Fe-, Co- and Ni-Based Superalloys
SO SURFACE ENGINEERING AND APPLIED ELECTROCHEMISTRY
AB High temperature corrosion of metals and alloys can be controlled by the use of inhibitors. In this work, the role of a superficially applied CeO2 coating to combat high temperature corrosion of some superalloys such as Superfer 800H (Alloy A), Superco 605 (Alloy B) and Superni 75 (Alloy C) has been investigated. An accelerated corrosion testing of the coated as well as bare superalloys was done in a molten salt environment (Na2SO4-60% V2O5) at 900 degrees C for 50 cycles. The weight change, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Electron Probe Micro Analysis (EPMA) of the exposed specimens were carried out to characterize the oxide scales. The percentage decrease in the weight gain in alloys A, B and C, with superficially applied CeO2, was found to be 23, 35 and 68%, respectively. It was concluded that ceria (ceric oxide) was most effective in reducing the corrosion rate in alloy C.

TI Microsegregation and precipitates of an as-cast Co-based
   superalloy-microstructural characterization and phase stability
   modelling
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB The demand for increased efficiency of industrial gas turbines and aero engines drives the search for the next generation of materials. Promising candidates for such new materials are Co-based superalloys. We characterize the microsegregation and solidification of a multi-component Co-based superalloy and compare it to a ternary Co-Al-W compound and to two exemplary Ni-based superalloys by combining the experimental characterization of the as-cast microstructures with complementary modelling of phase stability. On the experimental side, we characterize the microstructure and precipitates by electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and determine the element distributions and microsegregation coefficients by electron probe microanalysis (EPMA). On the modelling side, we carry out solidification simulations and a structure map analysis in order to relate the local chemical composition with phase stability. We find that the microsegregation coefficients for the individual elements are very similar in the investigated Co-based and Ni-based superalloys. By interpreting the local chemical composition from EPMA with the structure map, we effectively unite the set of element distribution maps to compound maps with very good contrast of the dendritic microstructure. The resulting compound maps of the microstructure in terms of average band filling and atomic-size difference explain the formation of topologically close-packed phases in the interdendritic regions. We identify B2, C14, and D0(24) precipitates with chemical compositions that are in line with the structure map.

TI Implications of solute super-saturation in growth of
   vaporisation-induced recrystallised grains during heat treatment in
   Ni-base superalloys
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MATERIALS RESEARCH
AB The role of vaporisation in the evolution of surface microstructural instability has been investigated in Ni-base superalloys during heat treatment below the solvus temperature. Initial nucleation of beta (beta) grains at the surface with random orientations arose from vaporisation of Ni, Co and Cr with subsequent de-stabilisation of gamma (gamma) phase. Further vaporisation and inter-diffusion resulted in a discontinuous reaction (secondary reaction zone -gamma prime (gamma') matrix + topologically close packed phases with needle-like morphology). On the other hand, advancement of the secondary reaction zone grain boundary was shown to be dependent only on the solute supersaturation ahead of the boundary. The driving force for growth of the secondary reaction zone was calculated from the Gibbs energy change and nearly all of this force was available to pull the grain boundary.

TI Characterisation of detonation gun sprayed Cr3C2-25NiCr coatings on Ni
   and Fe based superalloys
SO SURFACE ENGINEERING
AB Cr3C2-25NiCr coatings are essential to provide protection against both wear and corrosion of superalloys particularly in the temperature range up to 900-1000 degrees C. The Cr3C2-25NiCr coatings were deposited on the Fe and Ni based superalloys by D gun spray technique and subsequently investigated for their microstructural characteristics such as coating thickness, porosity, phase formation, microhardness, surface and cross-sectional morphologies. The coatings showed a dense microstructure with porosity contents less than 0(.)69%. The carbide grains of different size are uniformly cladded with the metallic binder and located around the splat boundaries as observed in the coatings. Lower carbide dissolution and its uniform distribution ensured a better binder protection in the coatings. High cohesive strength of the individual splats and high volume fraction of carbides contributed for the higher microhardness values of the coatings (775-1200 HV).

CL Wildbad Kreuth, GERMANY
AB The enhancement of efficiency in gas turbine engines requires the development of new superalloys capable of withstanding higher temperatures. The development of novel industrial cast and wrought (C&W) disk alloys with required combination of strength, creep and fatigue resistances at 700 degrees C is particularly desired due to the expensive cost of powder metallurgy. In this context, new C&W disk alloys were recently developed to fulfill these requirements. TMW4 shows higher properties than the current C&W disk alloy despite an expensive cost due to its high cobalt content, where as 718Plus presents a moderate cost with restricted creep properties at 700 degrees C compared to the current U720Li disk alloy. The new nickel base superalloys developed by Aubert & Duval were therefore designed to offer a better compromise between high temperature properties at 700 degrees C and cost. This paper describes the alloy metallurgical features and is especially focused on the alloy design which is extensively based on phase diagram modeling. The study was firstly carried out on small ingots of 6 kg to optimize the chemistry before forging 200 kg ingots by industrial processes. The ability to be processed by the conventional cast & wrought route and the control of the highly expensive elements contents confer to the alloys an attractive cost comparable to that of 718Plus alloy. The high amount of gamma' and the molybdenum-tungsten levels insure higher creep and tensile properties than those obtained with 718Plus.

AB High-temperature constructional parts of aircraft engines and energy units are exposed to high dynamic stress (fatigue processes and creep) and various temperatures in dioxide-corrosion condition (hot corrosion, oxidation and erosion). The improvement of aero-engine and turbine efficiency is possible through the increase of temperature in front of turbine. This requires the use of heat-resistant and creep-resistant materials, especially nickel-base superalloys which resist mentioned effects for a limited period of time. A deposition of protective layers should improve hot corrosion resistance. This paper is focused on microstructure of protective layers created by co-deposition of Al and Si on nickel-base superalloys INCO 713 LC and INCO 738 LC after thermal and thermal-stress exposition and on microstructure of basic materials (substrates). The contribution also shows creep tests results for both superalloys with and without a protective layer.

TI First-principles modeling of superlattice intrinsic stacking fault
   energies in Ni3Al based alloys
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB High-throughput quantum mechanics based simulations have been carried out to establish the change in lattice parameter and superlattice intrinsic stacking fault (SISF) formation energies in Ni3Al-based alloys using the axial Ising model. We had direct access to the variation in SISF energies due to finite compositional change of the added ternary transition metal (TM) element through constructing large supercells, which was equally necessary to account for chemical disorder. We find that most added TM ternaries induce an important quasi-linear increase in the SISF energy as a function of alloying composition x. The most pronounced increase corresponds to Fe addition, while Co addition decreases the SISF energy monotonically. Our results shed light on the role played by TM elements on strengthening L1(2) Ni3Al precipitates against stacking fault shear. The data are of high importance for designing new Ni-based superalloys based on computational approaches. (C) 2017 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Role of Superficially Applied SnO2 Inhibitor in Controlling High
   Temperature Corrosion of Some Fe-, Co- and Ni-Base Superalloys
SO OXIDATION OF METALS
AB Inhibitors and fuel additives have been used with varying success to combat high temperature corrosion of metals and alloys. In this work, the role of a superficially applied SnO2 coating to combat high temperature corrosion of some superalloys viz Superfer 800H (Alloy A), Superco 605 (Alloy B) and Superni 75 (Alloy C) has been investigated. Accelerated corrosion testing of the coated as well as bare superalloys was done in a molten salt environment (Na2SO4-60 %V2O5-) at 900 A degrees C for 50 cycles. Each cycle consisted of 1 h heating in a silicon carbide tube furnace followed by 20 min cooling in ambient air. Weight change measurements after each cycle were taken by an electronic balance having an accuracy of 0.01 mg. XRD, SEM and EPMA analyses of the exposed specimens were carried out to characterize the oxide scales. The bare superalloys showed more overall weight gains, in general, in comparison with their SnO2 coated counterparts. The corrosion rate for the bare Co-base alloy was found to be highest, whereas that for the Fe-base Superfer 800H a lowest. The percentage decrease in the weight gain in alloys A, B and C with superficially applied SnO2 was found to be 17.2, 66 and 50 % respectively after 30 cycles. The effectiveness of the SnO2 was perhaps due to its non-reactive nature with the corroding species and high melting point (1630 A degrees C).

TI EFFECT OF NOTCH ORIENTATION AND LOCAL RECRYSTALLIZATION ON THERMAL
   FATIGUE PROPERTIES OF A DIRECTIONALLY SOLIDIFIED Co-BASED SUPERALLOY
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB The directionally solidificated (DS) Co-based superalloys are widely used in aircraft turbine vanes due to the good stress-rupture parameters and excellent hot corrosion resistance. The cyclic change of temperatures and complex stress state thermal fatigue (TF) cracks happen frequently in vanes during service. However, most of the work are conducted in Ni-based superalloys and there is rare report concerning the TF behavior of DS Co-based superalloys. Furthermore, due to the residual strain accumulated during processing, shot peening, grinding and recrystallization (RX) frequently occur when the DS components are exposed to high temperatures. It is believed that RX may change the microstructure, especially adding more grain boundaries to DS alloys, and result in the reduction of the mechanical properties of DS superalloys. Therefore, in this work, V-notch plate specimens with notch direction perpendicular and parallel to the DS orientation are machined from the DS plate. Local RX grains are prepared (local indented and then heat treated) in the notch areas of some samples. TF test is conducted between 1000 degrees C to room temperature. The effect of DS orientation and RX on TF properties of a DS Co-based superalloy is investigated. The results indicate that the cracks propagate along the interdendritic regions in the samples with notches parallel to the DS direction, which exhibites lower TF properties than samples with notches vertical to the DS direction. TF cracks initiate and propagate along RX boundaries in samples containing RX grains. Precipitation of M23C6 carbides is found along the RX boundaries during TF tests. Due to the oxidation at the tip of crack, M23C6 desquamates and leads to the formation of micro voids, which accelerates the crack propagation and decreases TF properties of tested alloy. In samples with notches parallel to the DS direction, cracks preferentially propagate along the RX grain boundaries.

TI Mechanical and microstructural characterisations of NiCrCoAlYTa coatings
   on superalloys deposited by detonation gun technique
SO SURFACE ENGINEERING
AB The microstructure and mechanical properties of detonation gun sprayed NiCoCrAlYTa alloy coatings on the selected superalloys were investigated. The coatings were characterised in relation to thickness, porosity, microhardness, microstructure, compositions, and phases across by using the techniques such as optical microscopy, X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive analysis and X-ray mapping. The formation of spherical or elliptical shaped dendritic splats was observed in the as sprayed coatings on the superalloys. The splat morphology of the coatings is due to the deposition and re-solidification of successive molten or semimolten powder particles. The coatings showed a bond strength of 50 MPa and the surface roughness ( arithmetic average height) of the coatings was found to be in the range of 6(.)25-7(.)48 mm. The porosity and microhardness of the coatings were less than 0(.)48% and 385-748 Hv respectively. The XRD analysis of the coatings showed the phases gamma-Ni or gamma'- Ni3Al and beta-NiAl inter metallic as the minor phase.

AB The formation of topologically close-packed (TCP) phases in nickel-base superalloys is an issue of increasing importance as alloys are designed with higher refractory element contents to meet the requirements of next generation turbine engines. This review considers the factors that affect an alloy's susceptibility to TCP formation. In particular, the debate surrounding the effect of certain individual elements, such as Co and Re, in promoting or suppressing TCP formation is examined alongside the various mechanisms that have been proposed to account for this behaviour. In addition, the detrimental effects of these phases on the alloy's mechanical properties are discussed, including crack initiation at precipitates, depletion of solid solution strengthening refractory elements and the effect on Y/Y' rafting behaviour.

TI Joining alumina to Inconel 600 and UMCo-50 superalloys using an
   Sn10Ag4Ti active filler metal
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING AND PERFORMANCE
AB Alumina ceramics were brazed to Inconel 600 and UMCo-50 superalloys at 900 C for 10 min using an Sn10Ag4Ti active filler metal. The brazing filler showed good wettability on alumina and super-alloys. The flexural strengths were 69 and 57 MPa for alumina/Inconel 600 and alumina/UMCo-50 joints, respectively. In both cases, the brazed specimens fractured along the Sn10Ag4Ti/superalloy interfaces after four-point bending tests. Electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) elemental mapping revealed that the Ni of Inconel 600 and the Co of UMCo-50 dissolved into Sn10Ag4Ti filler metal, which serves to reinforce the weak Sn10Ag4Ti matrix.

AB The effect of crystal orientation on the microstructure of a nickel-based crystalline superalloys during directional solidification was explored. Differently oriented crystals with [001] and [011] orientations were fabricated with seeding technique. The results showed that primary dendrite arm spacings decreased simultaneously with the increase of misroientation. The primary dendrites arrange in lines in [011] single crystal. For [001] oriented crystals, the size of ?' phase increased with the increasing of misorientation. However, it was observed that the size of ?' decreased with large misorientation for [011] orientated growth. Meanwhile, more ?' in [011] crystals tended to be triangular.

TI The Intrinsic Relationship Between Microstructure Evolution and Thermal
   Fatigue Behavior of a Single-Crystal Cobalt-Base Superalloy
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA-ENGLISH LETTERS
AB The intrinsic relationship between the microstructure evolution and thermal fatigue behavior of a single-crystal cobalt-base superalloy has been investigated. The thermal fatigue tests are performed cyclically between room temperature and 1050 degrees C using V-notch plate specimens. Three states of thermal fatigue specimens are selected: the as-cast, solutionized as well as aged states. The solution treatment is carried out at 1260 degrees C for 24 h, which results in the dissolution of most of interdendritic continuous primary carbides. The subsequent aging treatment is carried out at 1100 degrees C for 100 h after solution treatment, resulting in the precipitation of a profusion of chain- and point-like M23C6 carbides in the matrix. The results indicate that the heat treatment can improve the thermal fatigue properties of the alloy and the effect of the solution treatment is more prominent than that of the aging treatment. The coarse and continuously distributed primary carbides in the as-cast state are changed into small and discontinuous distribution by heat treatment, which is the dominant factor in the improvement of thermal fatigue property. Additionally, the effect of oxidation behavior during thermal fatigue test on the thermal fatigue behavior is also studied.

TI Carbide tool wear mechanism in turning of Inconel 718 superalloy
SO WEAR
AB Wear surfaces of the cutting tools are analyzed to study the wear mechanism of cemented carbide tools in turning of Inconel 718 superalloys. SEM and EPMA analyses indicated that the wear of carbide tools during high speed turning condition (V = 35 m min (-1)) was caused by diffusion of elements (Ni or Fe) in workpiece into tool's binder (Co) by a grain boundary diffusion mechanism. This action weakened the bonding strength between carbide particles (WC, TiC, TaC) and the binder (Co). The carbide particles were then detached out of the cemented carbide tool by high flow stresses. The proposed grain boundary diffusion mechanism is also confirmed by theoretical analysis.

SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB To clarify and comprehend the co-growing mechanism of gamma/gamma' eutectic on MC-type carbide in a single crystal CM247LC superalloy, the interface and the elements' segregation between MC-type carbide and gamma/gamma' eutectic was investigated in this paper. The results show that a semi-coherent boundary was observed having an orientation relationship of {(11) over bar1}(MC) parallel to {(11) over bar1}(gamma/gamma') with < 011>(MC) parallel to < 011>(gamma/gamma'). This interface structure resulted in a high interface energy, and a reduced preference of gamma/gamma' eutectic's nucleation on MC-type carbide. However, this unfavorable interfacial feature was offset by the elements' segregation profile during the MC-type carbide's solidification, which is characterized by Al, Ni, Co and Cr enrichment and a co-growing mode.

AB Due to high strength and ductility, AISI 4141 alloy steel is widely used in many industrial applications, such as gears and blades. When it is composed to harsh working environment, severe mechanical failures may happen. In order to save the high added value of the components, necessary repairing techniques are required to recover their functionality. Laser Engineered Net Shaping (LENS) is an innovative technology for metal parts repairing and rebuilding due to its metallurgical bonding and exhibit heat affected zone (HAZ). Compared to other repairing processes, LENS cannot only reduce the manufacturing time and cost, increase material utilization, but also provide an outstanding as-fabricated mechanical properties. Considering the compatibility and availability of powder materials, the selection of to-be-fabricated materials are important and decisive to the mechanical properties and the quality of the deposits. In this investigation, nickel-based and cobalt based superalloys are deposited onto AISI 4140 steel substrate using laser engineered net shaping (LENS) process to verify the feasibility of these superalloys for repairing of AISI 4140 workpieces. The micro-hardness, tensile strength, fracture and wear resistance are analyzed to testify the resistance of deformation, tension and anti-friction performance of deposited materials.

SO ARCHIVES OF CIVIL AND MECHANICAL ENGINEERING
AB Palladium layer (7 mu m thick) was deposited on the surface of the Inconel 713 LC, Inconel 625 and CMSX 4 Ni-base superalloys by the electroplating method. Electroplated samples were annealed at 1050 degrees C for 2 h in the argon atmosphere. The aluminide coatings were deposited by the CVD method. The nonmodified aluminide coating consists of the NiAl phase. Palladium modification let to formation of the (Ni, Pd) Al phase in coatings. The palladium modified as well as nonmodified coatings were oxidized at 1100 degrees C in the air atmosphere. For both Inconel 713 LC and CMSX 4 superalloys palladium modified coatings show better oxidation resistance than nonmodified ones. Palladium inhibits the outward diffusion of substrate elements (cobalt and chromium) during oxidation of the aluminide coating. Moreover, it stabilizes the beta-NiAl phase, keeps the higher content of aluminum in the beta-NiAl phase for a long time and thus increases the lifetime of the coated substrate.

AB A polycrystalline hot working ingot metallurgy processing route for gamma/gamma' Co-Al-W superalloys has been developed. Based on Co-7Al-7W (at%), substitutions of Mo, V, Ti, Ta, Ni, Si, Fe and Cr were examined. The gamma' solvus was found to follow the same trends as those exhibited by alloys with higher gamma' fractions considered by other investigators. Excessive Cr additions were found to lead to discontinuous coarsening and eventually, the loss of the gamma' phase from the microstructures observed. Ni additions were examined, with some success, and found to restore the gamma' phase and raise the solvus temperature. It was found that the addition of 13 at.% Cr improved the oxidation resistance at 800 degrees C by over 40 times. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Effect of stacking fault segregation and local phase transformations on
   creep strength in Ni-base superalloys
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB In this study, two similar, commercial polycrystalline Ni-based disk superalloys (LSHR and ME3) were creep tested at 760 degrees C and 552 MPa to approximately 0.3% plastic strain. LSHR consistently displayed superior creep properties at this stress/temperature regime even though the microstructural characteristics between the two alloys were comparable. High resolution structural and chemical analysis, however, revealed significant differences between the two alloys among active gamma' shearing modes involving superlattice intrinsic and extrinsic stacking faults. In ME3, Co and Cr segregation and Ni and Al depletion were observed along the intrinsic faults-revealing a gamma' to gamma phase transformation. Conversely in LSHR, an alloy with a higher W content, Co and W segregation was observed along the intrinsic faults. This observation combined with scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) simulations confirm a gamma'-to-D0(19) chi phase transformation along the intrinsic faults in LSHR. Using experimental observations and density functional theory calculations, a novel local phase transformation strengthening mechanism is proposed that could be further utilized to improve the high temperature creep capabilities of Ni-base disk alloys.

SO CORROSION ENGINEERING SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB This paper describes the oxidation behaviour of two technologically important nickel based superalloys, RR3000 and CMSX-4, used extensively in gas turbine blade applications. Oxidation tests were conducted in air at 1100 degrees C for equal and extended periods of time, up to 100 h to compare the superalloys characteristic properties. The morphology of oxide growth in the test samples was investigated using metallography, SEM, EDX, X-ray diffraction ( XRD) and Cr3+ photoluminescence spectroscopy. The results indicated that irrespective of the duration of exposure, alloy RR3000 develops a much thicker oxide scale than alloy CMSX-4. Examination of cross-sections revealed that the scale grown on the alloy RR3000 is porous and has a three layered structure consisting of an outer layer of ( Ni,Co)O; a sublayer of CrTaO4 rich oxide with different spinels; and an inner layer of alpha-Al2O3. By contrast, the scale that forms on alloy CMSX-4 is compact and consists of two layers. The upper layer is primarily composed of spinels ( Ni, Co) Al2O4 and ( Ni,Cr)(2)O-4, and the inner layer of alpha-Al2O3. Residual stress measurements using luminescence spectroscopy point to a weak adhesion of the oxide scale to the substrate for alloy RR3000 and a strong adhesion for alloy CMSX-4.

AB In order to reduce CO(2) emissions from fusel power plants, advanced ultra super critical (A-USC) steam turbine has been developing in Europe, the United States, and Japan. Candidate materials for A-USC steam turbine are Ni-base superalloys because 700 degrees C exceeds the maximum service temperature of heat-resistant ferrite steels. Ni-base superalloys have Superior high temperature properties, but they are well known as freckle prone material. One of the keys to the Success of A-USC development is the availability of large size ingots for turbine shaft materials. There have been few Studies on the productivity of Ni-base superalloys for large ingots. In this study, six A-USC candidate alloys were selected. Freckle tendencies of those A-USC candidate alloys were assessed using a horizontal directional solidification apparatus. The tested alloys tended to freckle in the following order: Alloy230>LTES700>Alloy625>Alloy706>Alloy617-Ti free>FENIX-700>USC141>Alloy617-Ti. We propose that the tendencies could be estimated from liquid density difference calculations.

TI Electrochemical Dissolution Behavior of the Nickel-Based Cast Superalloy
   K423A in NaNO3 Solution
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB To date, many types of nickel-based superalloys have been widely used as key components in aircraft engines, and these can be categorized into wrought nickel-based superalloys and cast nickel-based superalloys according to the manufacturing process. However, regardless of the nature of the manufacturing process, nickel-based superalloys are difficult to machine using traditional methods Electrochemical machining (ECM) is an effective method for machining difficult-to-cut materials, especially nickel-based alloys, and there have been many reports concerning the electrochemical dissolution behavior of such alloys. However, the electrochemical dissolution behavior of cast superalloys has seldom been discussed.
   This study focuses on the electrochemical dissolution behavior of the cast superalloy K423A. The microstructure of the specimen was examined and numerous carbides were found to be distributed irregularly throughout the matrix, especially at the grain boundaries. The effects of the electrolyte and the electrolysis parameters on the electrochemical dissolution behavior were investigated by assessing the polarization curves and the open-circuit potentials. The results showed that a relatively stable and efficient dissolution process could be obtained using 10% NaNO3 solution at 40 degrees C. Dissolution experiments were performed at various current densities and corrosion times. A highly efficient and erratic current efficiency curve was found. The corroded specimens were examined using a surface-finish measuring instrument, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). The results showed that the microstructure of K423A, especially in terms of carbon and carbides, seriously interfered with the stability of the electrochemical dissolution process and led to a poor surface quality. A qualitative model has been proposed to illustrate the electrochemical dissolution behavior of K423A in NaNO3 solution. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The high-temperature oxidation behaviours of Ni base and Co base cast superalloys were studied to determine the effect of different grain sizes and different surface dendritic orientations. These microstructural characteristics were obtained by varying solidification rate and cutting orientation with regard to the external surface. Thermogravimetry tests were run at 1000 and 1100degreesC and parabolic oxidation constants were considered. It appears that oxidation is faster for fine microstructures than for coarser ones for Ni or Co alloys including tungsten in their chemical composition, while it is the contrary when W is not present. When the sample surface is mainly parallel to the dendritic network, the oxidation rate is greater than for a surface perpendicular to dendrites, for the studied Ni alloy. The same phenomenon is observed for the studied Co base alloy at 1100degreesC but the order is inverted at 1000degreesC. These different behaviours can be explained by the grain boundary densities and orientations obtained on surface, since they can influence the diffusion of species involved in the oxidation phenomena. It is also possible that the characteristics of the chromia scale, such as grain size and general quality, depend on the microstructural texture of the alloy.

AB High speed machining provides excellent surface quality with high productivity for many materials. This paper presents an experimental procedure applied both to conventional and high speed end milling cobalt based superalloy FSX414. The purpose was to compare machinability of this refractory material in both cases. It was shown that a superior surface finish was obtained in high speed milling (comparable to grinding), but cutting tools were rapidly worn out. To be cost effective, milling FSX414 with high cutting speed is recommended either when surface roughness is the main constraint of workpiece or after optimizing cutting parameters to maximize tool life.

AB Several cast strengthened superalloys, Ni base and Co base, were exposed to high temperature oxidation for long times and metallographically examined. Different, phenomena occurred in the sub-surface microstructure, depending on both alloy and temperature. Thermodynamic modelling was used to know what it happened for carbon during oxidation, then to explain the observed microstructural changes. It appears that carbon atoms either quit the alloy probably after its oxidation into gases, or on the contrary go deeper into the bulk where they promote the precipitation of new carbides by solid state transformation. Thereafter, thermodynamic modelling allowed to know the new local refractoriness of the zones affected by oxidation, then to appreciate the new mechanical properties in the sub-surface.

TI IMPROVEMENT OF CREEP-RUPTURE PROPERTIES BY SERRATED GRAIN-BOUNDARIES IN

SO ZEITSCHRIFT FUR METALLKUNDE
AB The improvement of creep-rupture properties by serrated grain boundaries was investigated using cobalt-base superalloys containing about 14 to 20 wt.% tungsten at 1089 and 1311 K. Serrated grain boundaries improved both the rupture life and the ductility, especially under lower stresses at 1089 K. The increase in rupture life was larger in the alloys containing a larger amount of W. Ductile grain boundary fracture surfaces, which involved dimple patterns and grain boundary ledges, were observed in the specimens with serrated grain boundaries whereas brittle grain boundary facets were observed in the specimens with normal straight grain boundaries ruptured at 1089 K. The strengthening by serrated grain boundaries was also effective at 1311 K, but there was little difference in the rupture life between the specimens with serrated grain boundaries and those with straight grain boundaries under lower stresses, since serrated grain boundaries developed also in the specimens with straight grain boundaries according to grain boundary precipitates forming during creep at 1311 K. The increase in W content of the alloys led to the increase in rupture life of the specimens with serrated grain boundaries at 1089 and 1311 K.

TI Oxidation behaviors of Co-A1-W-0.1B superalloys in a long-term
   isothermal exposure at 900 degrees C
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Co-Al-W-0.1B superalloys have been isothermally oxidized at 900 degrees C for 1000,5000 and 10000 h in order to investigate their oxidation behaviors. The oxide layers and morphologies were characterized by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy combined with energy-dispersive spectroscopy. After 1000 h exposure, a Co3W/gamma zone, an Al2O3 layer, a mixture of Co, Al, W oxides layer and a CoO layer are established on the substrate alloys. After extended oxidation, a discontinuous Al2O3 layer in Co-9Al-8W-0.1 B and Co-9Al-9W-0.1B alloys leads to an additional mixed oxide layer on the substrate instead of the Co3W/gamma zone. The oxide layers that form on the Co-9Al-8W-0.1B and Co-9Al-9W-0.1B alloys are much thicker than those on the Co-9Al-11W-0.1B alloy, and continuously thicken during oxidation. The higher content of W is beneficial to improving the oxidation resistance as it facilitates a faster formation of Co3 W as well as Al2O3.

The influence of chromium (0-10 at.%) addition on the microstructure and oxidation properties of a gamma/gamma' two-phase Co82Al9W9-based superalloy was systematically investigated. The in situ oxidation behaviour of Cr-containing alloys was studied using environmental TEM, and the addition of moderate Cr amounts is suggested for the alloy design.

TI Formation and cyclic oxidation resistance of Hf-Co-modified aluminide
   coatings on nickel base superalloys
SO MATERIALS CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
AB The codeposition of Co, Al and Hf on nickel base superalloys by pack cementation in a single-step process was investigated in this work. Thermochemical analyses were applied to search for suitable conditions including pack composition and deposition temperature. Co, Al, Hf, NH4Cl, NH4I and Al2O3 made up the pack powder mixture. According to a series of thermochemical calculations, the pack powder mixture of 20Co-10Al-2Hf-4NH(4)Cl-4NH(4)I-60Al(2)O(3) (wt.%) was adopted. Further experimental results demonstrated that the codeposition of Co, Al and Hf could be achieved practically. The coating consisted of a diffusion zone and an outer layer. The outer layer was mainly composed of Al0.9Ni1.1 where a part of Ni was replaced by Co or Hf. The trace element Hf was enriched in the interface between the outer layer and the diffusion zone. The Co-Al-Hf coating exhibited excellent cyclic oxidation resistance due to improvement in adhesion between the oxide scale and the coating. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Density functional theory study of the thermodynamic and elastic
   properties of Ni-based superalloys
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER
AB The thermophysical properties of Ni-based single-crystal superalloys were investigated using first-principles calculations combined with the quasiharmonic approximation. The effect of alloying elements X (X = Re, Ru, Ta, W, Mo, Cr, and Co) on the thermophysical properties of the gamma-Ni and gamma'-Ni3Al phases was investigated. The calculations showed that alloying can effectively adjust the lattice misfit between the two phases, and Cr can suppress lattice misfit and may improve the creep resistance of alloys. At 0 K, doping with refractory elements leads to tetragonal shear softening of the gamma-Ni phase. For gamma-Ni, Re, Ru, Cr, and Co slightly increase C-44, while Mo, W, and Ta decrease c44. Importantly, high-temperature relative hardening was found to occur close to the service temperature of the superalloy, at which Ru and Cr increase c' and Mo and W increase c44 of gamma-Ni. For the gamma'-Ni3Al phase, all of the alloying elements except Co considerably increase c' and c44. Re and W at the Al site were found to most effectively harden the gamma'-Ni3Al phase. The thermophysical and elastic properties were fully understood by analysis of the electronic structures and phonon spectra. It was found that the electronic density of states (DOS) can account for elastic hardening due to alloying. The phonon spectra along with electronic DOS analysis showed that alloying not only strengthens the first nearest neighbor Ni-X bond through additional d-d hybridization, but it is also important for stiffening the second nearest neighbor Al-X bonding through p-band filling.

SO CORROSION SCIENCE
AB A NiCrAlYSi coating was deposited by arc ion plating on a cobalt-base super-alloy K40S to improve its hot corrosion resistance at 1173 K in air. The K40S suffered from accelerated corrosion and formed non-protective scale with poor adherence when its surface was beneath Na(2)SO(4) and Na(2)SO(4) containing 25 wt.% NaCl salt deposits. After the K40S was coated with NiCrAlYSi coating, a protective alpha-Al(2)O(3) scale was formed on the coating. Although the NiCrAlYSi coating changed into NiCoCrAlYSi during corrosion processes, it still possessed good corrosion resistance. In addition, the corrosion mechanisms were discussed on a basis of basic fluxing model. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The microstructure and XRD analysis together with EDS determination show that L1(2) type Co(3)Ti phase and Laves_C36_Co(3)Ta phase get equilibrium with alpha-Co phase from 1 000 to 1 200 degrees C. The Co(3)Ti phase possesses a solubility of Ta higher than 10%, and the addition of Ta stabilizes the Co(3)Ti phase.

TI Microstructure formation in gamma-gamma ' Co-Al-W-Ti alloys during
   directional solidification
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB The microstructure formation process in Co-Al-W-Ti alloys was investigated through quenching performed during directional solidification. The phase transition route of the Co-Al-W-Ti alloys during directional solidification is determined as follows: L -> L + gamma -> L + gamma + (beta + gamma') -> L + gamma + gamma' + (beta + gamma') -> gamma + gamma' + beta + (beta + gamma'). The eutectic (beta + gamma'), primary gamma' and b are orderly deposited in terminal stages of solidification. The eutectic gamma' and beta are well distributed and nucleate in random directions. The gamma' particles are precipitated initially from the interdendritic Al-rich regions and subsequently from the dendritic region. The sizes of the gamma' particles close to the primary gamma' and beta phases are greater than that of the particles far from them. Since the growth of eutectic colonies restricts the interdendritic liquid convection at earlier stage of the terminal solidification, Co-Al-W-Ti alloys are resistant to the grain defect formation and suitable for fabricating single crystal components.

AB The analytical limitations in atom probe tomography such as resolving a desired set of atomic planes, for solving complex materials science problems, have been overcome by employing a well-developed unique and reproducible crystallographic technique, involving synergetic coupling of orientation microscopy with atom probe tomography. The crystallographic information in atom probe reconstructions has been utilized to determine the solute site occupancies in Ni-Al-Cr based superalloys accurately. The structural information in atom probe reveals that both Al and Cr occupy the same sub-lattice within the Ll(2)-ordered gamma' precipitates to form Ni-3(Al,Cr) precipitates in a Ni-14Al-7Cr (at%) alloy. Interestingly, the addition of Co, which is a solid solution strengthener, to a Ni-14Al-7Cr alloy results in the partial reversal of Al site occupancy within gamma' precipitates to form (Ni, Al)(3)(Al,Cr,Co) precipitates. This unique evidence of reversal of Al site occupancy, resulting from the introduction of other solutes within the ordered structures, gives insights into the relative energetics of different sub-lattice sites when occupied by different solutes.

TI An overview of Na2SO4 and/or V2O5 induced hot corrosion of Fe- and
   Ni-based superalloys
SO REVIEWS ON ADVANCED MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Metals and alloys sometimes experience accelerated oxidation when their surfaces are covered with a thin film of fused salt in an oxidizing gas atmosphere at elevated temperatures. This is known as hot corrosion where a porous non-protective oxide scale is formed at the surfaces and sulphides in the substrate. Hot corrosion has been identified as a serious problem in high temperature applications such as in boilers, gas turbines, waste incinerations, diesel engines, coal gasification plants, chemical plants and other energy generation systems. It is basically induced by the impurities such as Na, V, S, K and Cl, which are present in the coal or in fuel oil used for combustion in the abovementioned applications. The use of Ni-, Fe- and Co- based superalloys in high temperature applications such as gas turbines, boilers, etc. is well known, and many more applications are still to be explored. Although the superalloys have adequate mechanical strength for such high temperature applications, they are prone to degradation by hot corrosion/high temperature oxidation during long term exposures. Therefore, the superalloys need to be protected, however the protection system must be practical, reliable, and economically viable. In this paper the hot corrosion phenomenon has been described in detail with a special reference to Fe- and Ni-based superalloys with the help of a survey of the available literature related to the hot corrosion of the superalloys, in the environments constituting mainly of Na2SO4 and/or V2O5.

SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY
AB The three-stage isothermal solidification process of TLP bonded Mar-M247 nickel-based superalloy was studied. The transient liquid phase bonding of Mar-M247 superalloys was conducted at 1150 degrees C for 1,60, 120 and 240 min. Dendritic formation and solute partitioning governed the microstructure development. Ni-rich solid solution, Ni-rich boride W-rich boride and other carboborides were formed in the joint area. The maximum tensile strength of 443 MPa was obtained when TLP bonding at 1150 degrees C for 240 min. It had completed isothermal solidification. After isothermal solidification, the distribution of microhardness across the joints was more homogeneous. Enrichment of refractory elements in the Ni-Cr-Co-W-Ta-B interlayer was detrimental to the process of isothermal solidification. The presence of hard and brittle borides reduced the hardness and tensile strength of the bonded area. Post-bonding heat treatments are suggested to improve mechanical properties in future studies.

TI Cluster formulas of Co-Al-W-base superalloys
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Having a gamma/gamma' microstructure similar to Ni-base superalloys and also including various alloying elements such as Al and W, new Co-base superalloy, namely Co-Al-W-base alloy, has been widely studied as a kind of potential alternative of Ni-base superalloy, which is the most important high-temperature structural material in industrial applications. Besides, Co-Al-W-base alloy has also excellent mechanical properties, for example, creep properties comparable to those of the first-generation Ni-base single crystal superalloys. In our previous work, the ideal composition formula of Ni-base superalloy has been obtained by applying the cluster-plus-glue-atom structure model of faced centered cubic solid solution, which shows that the most stable chemical short-range-order unit is composed of a nearest-neighbor cluster and three next-neighbor glue atoms. In this paper, the ideal cluster formula of Co-Al-W-base superalloy is addressed by using the same approach. Based on cluster-plusglue-atom model theory, according to lattice constants and atom radii, calculations are carried out. The results show that the atom radius of Al is equal to Covalent radius (0.126 nm) and for gamma' phase the atom radius of W changes obviously (0.1316 nm). After analyzing atomic radii, the chemical formula for Co-Al-W ternary alloy is calculated to be [Al-Co-12](Co,Al,W)(3), which signifies an Al centered atom and twelve Co nearest-neighbored cluster atoms plus three glue atoms, which is in good consistence with that for Ni-base single crystal superalloy. For multi-element alloy, the alloying elements are classified, according to the heat of mixing between the alloying elements and Co as well as partition behavior of alloying elements, as solvent elements-Co-like elements (Co) over bar (Co, Ni, Ir, Ru, Cr, Fe, and Re) and solute elements-Al-like elements (Al) over bar (Al, W, Mo, Ta, Ti, Nb, V, etc.). The solvent elements can be divided into two kinds according to partition behaves: (Co) over bar (gamma) (Cr, Fe, and Re) and (Co) over bar (gamma)' (Ni, Ir, and Ru).
   The latter is further grouped into Al, (W) over bar (W and Mo, which have weaker heat of mixing than Al-Co ) and (Ta) over bar (Ta, Ti, Nb, V, etc., which have stronger heat of mixing than Al-Co). Then all chemically complex Co-Al-W-base superalloys are simplified into (Co) over bar-(Al) over bar pseudo-binary or (Co) over bar -Al-(W) over bar, (Ta) over bar pseudo-ternary system. Within the framework of the cluster-plus-glue-atom formulism and by analyzing the compositions of alloy, it is shown that the Co-Al-W-base superalloy satisfies the ideal formula [(Al) over bar-(Co) over bar (12)] ((Co) over bar (1.0)(Al) over bar (2.0)) (or [(Al) over bar-(Co) over bar Al-1.0(0.5)((W) over bar,(Ta) over bar)(1.5) = (Co) over bar (81.250)(Al) over bar9.375 ((W) over bar, (Ta) over bar)(9.375) at.%). In the same way, those of gamma and gamma' phases are respectively [(Al) over bar-(Co) over bar (12)] ((Co) over bar (1.5)(Al) over bar (1.5)) (or [Al-(Co) over bar (12)] (Co) over bar Al-0.5(2.5)((W) over bar, (Ta) over bar)(1.0 )= (Co) over bar Al-84.375(9.375)((W) over bar, (Ta) over bar)(6.250) at.%) and (Al) over bar-(Co) over bar (12)((Co) over bar (0.5 )(Al) over bar (2.5) ) (or [Al-(Co) over bar (12)]Co (Co) over bar (0.5) Al-0.5 ((W) over bar, (Ta) over bar)(2.0) = (Co) over bar Al-78.125(9.375) ((W) over bar, (Ta) over bar)(12.500) at.%). For example, alloy Co82Al9W9 and its gamma and gamma' phases are formulated respectively as [Al-Co-12] Co1.1Al0.4W1.4 (similar to[Al-Co-12]Co1.5Al0.5W1.0), [Al-Co-12]Co1.6Al0.4W1.0) (similar to[Al-Co-12]Co1.5Al0.5W1.0), and [Al-Co-12]Co0.3Al0.5W2.2) (similar to[Al-Co-12]Co0.5Al0.5W2.0).

TI Computational thermodynamics and genetic algorithms to design affordable
   gamma '-strengthened nickel-iron based superalloys
SO MODELLING AND SIMULATION IN MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
AB Computational thermodynamics based on the CALPHAD approach (Thermo-Calc software) are used to design creep-resistant and affordable superalloys for large-scale applications such as power plants. Cost is reduced by the introduction of iron and by avoiding the use of expensive alloying elements such as Nb, Ta, Mo, Co etc. Strengthening is ensured by the addition of W, and of Al and Ti to provoke the precipitation of gamma'. However, the addition of iron reduces the maximum possible volume fraction of gamma'. The latter is maximized automatically using a genetic algorithm during simulation, while keeping the alloys free of undesirable phases at high temperatures. New superalloys with 20 wt% Cr are designed, with Fe content up to 37 wt%. They should be forgeable, weldable, oxidation resistant and significantly cheaper than existing alloys with equivalent properties.

   superalloys
SO INTERMETALLICS
AB The structure and chemistry of Ni-Co-Al-Ti quaternary superalloys are investigated at the micro structural and atomic scale. Atom probe tomograghy (APT) is used to quantify phase compositions and elemental partitioning behavior. Using aberration corrected electron microscopy, the site occupancy of the atoms within the A(3) B structure (L1(2)-type) gamma' phase is determined via atomic resolution energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). Ni is observed to preferentially occupy the A sub-lattice positions for all alloys, while Al and Ti occupy the B sub-lattice. In contrast, Co's site preference changes from a random distribution to the A sub-lattice as the alloy composition changes, in agreement with theoretical predictions from literature. Finally, the lattice strain across the 771, interfaces is measured as a function of alloy composition. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Water Vapour Effect on the Oxidation Mechanism of a Cobalt-Based Alloy
   at High Temperatures (800-1,100 A degrees C)
SO OXIDATION OF METALS
AB A cobalt-based Phynox alloy was oxidized in the 800-1,100 A degrees C temperature range. The alloy oxidation was consistent with a growth mechanism limited by the diffusion process in a growing Cr2O3 oxide scale. Water vapour enhanced the alloy oxidation rate and scale porosity. Thermal cycling tests at 900 and 1,000 A degrees C showed that water vapour reduces the outer Mn1.5Cr1.5O4 subscale adherence, but the chromia scale adherence was not affected. These temperatures permited a rapid chromium supply from the substrate to form a continuous chromia scale. At 1,100 A degrees C thermal cycling conditions led to scale spallation and chromium depletion in the alloy. In dry air, weight losses were recorded due to cobalt and molybdenum oxidation, giving CoCr2O4 and CoMoO4. In wet air, the initial porous chromia scale permited nickel and cobalt oxidation, leading to Ni5Co3O8 and CoCr2O4 formation and resulting in bad adherence during thermal cycling.

TI A thermodynamic database for Ni-base superalloys
SO SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF METALLURGY
AB A thermodynamic database has been developed for Ni-base superalloys. Following the CALPHAD procedure, it is based on the assessment of thermodynamic behaviour of the relevant constituting sub-systems of the complex system of interest. The current database contains 7 elements: Al, Co, Cr, Ni, Ti, W, Re. The thermodynamics of the gamma and gamma' phases are modelled with a single Gibbs energy function taking into account the crystallographic relation between these two phases. The formalism of the thermodynamic models used is briefly introduced. A few phase diagrams calculated with the current database in assessed binary and ternary systems are presented. Some experiments available in higher order systems are compared with the results of calculations with the current database. The ability of extrapolation of the database is verified for solid state equilibria as well as for solidification behaviour (liquidus temperature and partition ratios). The introduction of Mo and Ta to the current database is in progress. Other elements (Nb, Fe, Zr, Hf, C, B, . . .) are planed to be introduced.

AB Rhenium was one of important alloying elements in the Ni-based superalloys. Based on the molar Gibbs energy of the pure Re updated in SGTE Pure 5 database, the Re-X(X = Al, Co, Cr, Ta) systems were re-optimized by means of CALPHAD (CALculation of PHAse Diagrams) technique. In the present work, the phases liquid, fcc, bcc and hcp were described using a substitutional solution model. The phases AlRe, Al3Re, Al6Re, Al12Re, AlRe2 and Al11Re4 in the Re-Al system were described as stochiometric compound. The Al4Re_H and Al4Re_L instead of Al4Re were evaluated in the present work. The phases a in the Re-Cr and Re-Ta systems and chi in the Re Ta system were modeled as (X, Re)(10)(X, Re)(20) (X = Cr or Ta) and Re-24(Re, Ta)(10)(Re, Ta)(24), respectively. A set of self consistent thermodynamic parameters of the Re-X systems were obtained and the optimized results were in good agreement with the experimental data.

TI Microstructure, phase stability and element partitioning of gamma-gamma
   ' Co-9Al-9W-2X alloys in different annealing conditions
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB The phase stability, gamma' precipitate morphology and element partitioning behavior in dependence on temperature and alloying composition have been systematically investigated in Co-9Al-9W-2X alloys using electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and high-energy X-ray diffraction (HEXRD). The results show that the decomposition of the gamma' phase is promoted by adding some quaternary elements which increase the gamma' solvus temperature (except V). A larger lattice misfit in the Mo, V, Ti, Nb or Ta containing alloys can explain that coarser gamma' particles with a more cuboidal morphology were found in these alloys. Additional alloying elements and the annealing temperature show a stronger influence on the partitioning behavior of W between the gamma and gamma' phases compared to that of Co and Al. The partitioning tendency towards the g 0 phase decreases with increasing temperature for all investigated alloying elements except Cr. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SO MATERIALS LETTERS
AB The micro-segregation behavior of different oriented single crystal nickel based superalloys in directional solidification has been explored. The results show that the segregation level in the dendrite structure has relationship with the crystal orientation. in general, with increasing deviation angle from the < 001 > orientation, the segregation coefficients of Al, Ti and Ta increase, and the segregation coefficients of W and Co decrease. The segregation degree of Al, Ta, W and Co increases with the misorientation in the < 011 > oriented crystals, except for Ti. Segregation of Mo and Cr is less affected by the orientation variation. Different misorientations also lead to different segregation profiles. The crystal with smaller deviation angle from the < 001 > orientation has a shorter segregation distance. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

TI Numerical simulation of microstructure evolution in Ni-based superalloys
   during P-type rafting using multiphase-field model and crystal
   plasticity
SO COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB During the service process, Ni-based superalloys undergo microstructure evolutions such as rafting, which greatly affect its service performance. In the present study, a multiphase-field model coupled with crystal plasticity was established to simulate the gamma/gamma' microstructure evolution of Ni-based superalloys during P-type rafting. The anisotropic plasticity considering 12 octahedral slip systems was defined in gamma matrix channel. The PanNickel (c) database was used to calculate thermodynamic and kinetic data for phase transition and diffusion in multicomponent superalloys. First, the model was validated by two benchmarks with and without consideration of external load respectively. Then, the anisotropic of slip systems was analyzed. It was found that eight slip systems A2, A3, B2, B4, C1, C3, D1, D4 were activated in gable channel first when the structure was compressed in [0 0 1] direction. Besides, the elements distribution was studied. It can be seen that Al, Ti, Ta diffused into precipitates while Co, Cr and Mo diffused away the roof channel when the structure was compressed in [0 0 1] direction. Re and W mainly distributed in the gamma/gamma' interface because their slow diffusion rate. Finally, the P-type raft of CMSX-4 superalloy was simulated, and the plasticity distribution and plastic behavior of the 12 slip systems were discussed. The current model can be used to simulate phase transformation of multicomponent superalloys where plasticity is strongly coupled.

Wettability tests have been performed by means of the "sessile drop" method at 1500 A degrees C; the characterization of the interfaces between the molten drop and the substrates has been performed by SEM/EDS analysis in order to check the final characteristics of the solidified interfaces. The results are discussed in terms of chemical interactions in relation to the processing parameters and as a function of the surface and interfacial, morphological and energetic properties of the systems.

AB Nanostructural features of nickel-base superalloys as revealed by atom probe field ion microscopy (APFIM) and atom probe tomography (APT) are reviewed. The more salient information provided by these techniques is discussed through an almost exhaustive analysis of literature over the last 30 years. Atom probe techniques are shown to be able to measure the composition of tiny gamma' precipitates, a few nanometers in size, and to reveal chemical order within these precipitates. Phase separation kinetics in model NiCrAl alloys was investigated with both 3DAP and Monte-Carlo simulation. Results are shown to be in good agreement. Plane by plane analysis of {001} planes of Ni3Al-type gamma' phase makes it possible to estimate the degree of order as well as the preferential sites of various addition elements (Ti, Cr, Co, W, Ta, Re, Ru, etc.) included in superalloys. Clustering effects of Re in the gamma solid solution were also exhibited. Due to its ultrahigh depth resolution, the microchemistry of interfaces and grain boundaries can be characterized on an atomic scale. Grain boundaries in Astroloy or N18 superalloys were found to be enriched in B, Mo, and Cr and Al depleted.

CL Wildbad Kreuth, GERMANY
AB Fourth generation superalloys are characterised by the addition of Ru which contributes to improved creep resistance whilst improving the microstructural stability. However, Ru additions have a negative effect on coated Ni-base superalloys, promoting Secondary Reaction Zone (SRZ) formation. Formation of a layer of SRZ beneath an aluminised or Pt-aluminised coating has the potential to reduce the effective cross section of a blade by in excess of 100 gm or 10% of the wall thickness. In this paper the effects of alloy composition on the formation of the SRZ in Pt-Aluminised fourth generation alloys were investigated systematically. A series of experimental fourth generation alloys was used having two distinct compositions of Co, Mo, W and Ru and conforming to a four factorial 'Design of Experiments' model. These alloys showed significant and consistent changes in the SRZ depending on alloy composition. These were in distinct contrast to the effects of these elements on stability in the bulk. Mo was demonstrated to be by far the most effective element suppressing SRZ formation, followed by Co. In contrast, both W and Ru enhance SRZ formation.

The statistical analysis showed that Al and Ta generally improve the oxidation resistance of the alloy, whereas Ti and Mo degrade the oxidation resistance. Co, Cr, and W did not alter oxidation rate significantly when examined by the mass gain averaged for all model alloys. However, it is remarkable that the degree of the effects of alloying elements varied with the concentration of other elements. Further, the effect of each element was sometimes found to be reversed for alloy groups specified by the concentration of another element.

AB Mar-M 247, a nickel-base cast alloy, is used widely in aeroengines for parts such as blades, vanes and airfoil. Hastelloy X is one of the most oxidation-and corrosion-resistant nickel-base wrought alloys. In order to join such alloys in aeroengine manufacturing, laser beam welding has been carried out with lap and butt joints using a 1.2 and a 6.0 kW CO2 laser. Cracks in the fusion zone can be eliminated by deliberate misalignments in the ranging of the laser beam by 0.2-0.3 mm onto Hastelloy X. Correlations between cracking behavior, hardness of the beads and misalignments have been investigated. Metallurgical analysis using electron microscopes has revealed the redistribution of alloy elements, the microstructures of the fusion zone and microfissures in the heat-affected zone (HAZ).

TI On the design and feasibility of tantalum-base superalloys
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB In order to reduce the environmental impact of air travel, it is desirable that the efficiencies of gas turbine engines are increased. One way to achieve this goal is to increase the operating temperatures of the engine cores. Unfortunately for aero-engine manufacturers, the temperature capability limits of the Ni-base superalloys used currently have been reached. Hence, new alloys need to be developed that are capable of operating at significantly higher temperatures. In this article, the potential of tantalum-base superalloys is discussed and explored. A suite of alloys based on the Ta-Al-Co system was investigated. It was found that an array of fine carbide precipitates was formed in the Ta-rich matrix in a subset of the alloys, which is promising in terms of developing a strong and damage-tolerant microstructure, but that the elemental partitioning of Al out of the matrix accompanying precipitation is likely to degrade environmental resistance. Nevertheless, it is believed that the design principles described have the potential to facilitate the development of the next generation of high-temperature alloys based on systems of this type.

AB In this study, Al-Co-Ni ternary alloys were synthesized, in order to obtain low-cost starting material for Ni-based superalloy production, by a self-propagating high temperature synthesis (SHS) both under normal gravity conditions (a = 9.81 m/s(2)) and under high gravity conditions (up to 1000 g-force) by using a centrifugal machine. The mixture of Co3O4-NiO powder were reduced by Al powder for the production of SHS alloys with the estimated compositions of 5-10 mass% Al, 20-65 mass% Co, 25-75 mass% Ni. The effect of green mixture compositions and centrifugal overload on combustion temperature, alloy/slag separations, chemical composition and microstructure of final alloys were investigated. The chemical analysis results showed that production of SHS alloys were achieved by having up to 86.12% of Co and 92.32% of Ni recoveries. The highest metal recovery value was obtained in SHS alloy with the estimated composition of 10%Al-65%Co-25% Ni by the addition of 20% Al2O3 into the green mixture. The metal/slag separation efficiency increased by increasing the centrifugal overload.

AB Refurbishments of superalloys which are used in manufacturing gas turbine hot components usually consists of removing cracks and other defects by blending and then repair welding in order to reconstruct damaged area. In this study, the effects of welding parameters on repair of FSX-414 superalloy, as the most applicable cobalt base superalloy in order to manufacture gas turbine nozzles, by use of Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW) technic were investigated. Results then were compared by Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW). Metallographic and SEM studies of the microstructure of the weld and HAZ showed that there are no noticeable defects in the microstructure by use of GMAW. Also, chemical analysis and morphologies of carbide in both methods are similar. Hardness profile of the GMAW structure then also compared with GTAW and no noticeable difference was observed between the profiles. Also, proper tensile properties, compared with GTAW, can be achieved by use of optimum parameters that can be obtained by examining the current and welding speed. Tensile properties of optimized condition of the GMAW then were compared with GTAW. It was seen that the room and high temperature tensile properties of the GMAW structure is very similar and results confirmed that changing the technic did not have any significant influence on the properties.

TI The investigation of carbides evolution in a cobalt-base superalloy at
   elevated temperature
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB The carbides evolution characteristics and mechanisms in a cobalt-base superalloy at elevated temperatures between 1140 and 1265 degrees C have been investigated to provide the basis for potential service and heat treatment of the alloy. The in-situ transformation of M7C3 -> M23C6 is observed directly, which has not been reported in previous studies of cobalt-base superalloys. M23C6 carbide nucleates at the M7C3/ matrix interface due to the coherent relationship between M23C6 carbide and the matrix, and grows towards M7C3 carbide. On the other hand, it is found that primary MC carbide degenerates and releases a large number of Ti and W. Thus, residual MC carbide exhibits increased concentration ratios for Ta and Zr and shows enhanced thermal stability. The results indicate that the degeneration behavior of MC carbide is temperature dependent: MC decomposes into M6C carbide at lower temperature and dissolves partially into the matrix at higher temperature.

TI Strengthening Effect of Alloying Elements on Powder Metallurgical FGH97
   Superalloys
SO RARE METAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING
AB Based on typical FGH97 components, three P/M superalloys were designed and prepared by modifying alloying elements contents of Co, Cr, Mo and W. The strengthening effect of alloying elements on FGH97 was investigated. The results show that after modifying four alloying elements contents, the lattice parameters of gamma phases increase which enhances the effect of solid solution strengthening, and absolute values of gamma/gamma' misfit increase which enhances coherent strain strengthening. However, there is no precipitation strengthening or grain boundary strengthening. Solid solution strengthening makes the largest contribution to the increment of tensile strength at room temperature.

AB A family of novel polycrystalline Ni-based superalloys with varying Ti:Nb ratios has been created using computational alloy design techniques, and subsequently characterized using atom probe tomography and electron microscopy. Phase chemistry, elemental partitioning, and gamma' character have been analyzed and compared with thermodynamic predictions created using Thermo-Calc. Phase compositions and gamma' volume fraction were found to compare favorably with the thermodynamically predicted values, while predicted partitioning behavior for Ti, Nb, Cr, and Co tended to overestimate gamma' preference over the gamma matrix, often with opposing trends vs Nb concentration.

TI Low-activity aluminide coatings for superalloys using a slurry process
   free of halide activators and chromates
SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB Slurry aluminide coatings have been well known for a number of years and are widely used to protect metallic surfaces from oxidation and corrosion. A variety of commercial slurries is available to aluminize the surfaces of nickel-based superalloys, however, they have several disadvantages. They contain environmentally harmful substances such as chromates or halides which are used as binders or to activate the diffusion species. Additionally, up to now slurry coatings were only used to produce precipitate-rich coatings, with a microstructure comparable to high aluminum activity coatings produced by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) like pack cementation.
   In this work these limitations have been overcome by carefully designing the powder composition of the slurry. Three different nickel-aluminide coatings were developed and applied onto CM-247 nickel-based alloy and Pt-diffused CM-247. By addition of chromium we achieved coatings with a similar microstructure and Al-content (of around 40 at.%), comparable to the state of the art low-activity coatings produced by CVD. Co-deposition of silicon was also achieved in a single step, maintaining the low-activity structure by combining Al-Si powder and chromium. Furthermore, this coating procedure was combined with a platinum electrodeposition step in order to produce single phase Pt-modified low-activity aluminide coatings. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

TI Tensile behaviour of Co-Al-W-Ta-B-Mo alloys with a coherent gamma/gamma'
   microstructure at room and high temperatures
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB The microstructure and tensile behaviour of Mo-doped Co-9Al-(9-x)W-2Ta-0.02B-xMo alloys (where x=0, 2, and 4 at% is hereafter referred to as 0Mo, 2Mo, and 4Mo alloys, respectively) at room and high temperatures have been investigated. Aged at 800 degrees C for 100 h, all alloys consist of a Co solid-solution gamma-Coss matrix and nano-scale cuboidal gamma'-Co-3(Al, W) intermetallic precipitates. The gamma matrix is coherent with the gamma-Co-3(Al, W) precipitates. With a coherent gamma/gamma'-Co3(Al, W) microstructure, the aged alloys show tensile yield strength anomalies at temperatures above 700 degrees C, and the 0Mo alloy always exhibits the highest strength at 600-800 degrees C. It is interesting that the alloys also possess anomalously low elongation of 0.4-3.3% at 600-800 degrees C, which is significantly below the similar to 10% elongation at room temperature. Intergranular cleavage is found to be the dominant failure mode of the gamma/gamma'-Co-3(Al, W) microstructure at high temperatures, resulting in tensile plasticity anomalies. At room temperature, however, slip bends are observed on the aligned gamma and gamma' phases, and the gamma/gamma'-Co-3(Al, W) coherent microstructure fails in a dimple mode with excellent elongation.

The interaction of atom pairs and the total energy of the system arc calculated using Lennard-Jones potential. The variables to be optimized in yielding a minimized energy were found to include the atomic positions, the (long- and short-range) ordering parameters, the volume fraction of the gamma' (LI2) phase, and the configuration energy dependence on the number of CA steps. The results are consistent with the ordering kinetics and the atomic arrangement found by a cluster variation method (CVM). (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SO MATERIALS CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
AB The impurity formation energies of the sigma and gamma phases of Ni-based single crystal superalloys doped with W, Cr and Co in different sublattices have been investigated using first-principles based on the density functional theory. The bonding characteristics of the doped a phase were analyzed with the valence charge densities and the density of the states. The results of the calculations indicated that the typical refractory element W, which has a large atomic size, preferentially partitions into the sigma phase due to the nature of the bonding and the unique crystal structure with close-packed planes and large interstitial spaces. In addition, the site preference of refractory elements in gamma phase was in the order of W, Cr and Co. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Prediction of thermal mechanical fatigue properties of ni-base single
   crystal superalloys
SO JOURNAL OF THE JAPAN INSTITUTE OF METALS
AB This study was carried out to find out the mechanical properties of nickel-base superalloys that affect thermal mechanical fatigue (TMF). TMF tests and high temperature tensile tests were conducted on 28 of Ni-base single crystal superalloys in order to obtain mechanical property data. Based on the experimental data, Multiple regression analysis was performed for the correlation between the number of TMF cycles to failure and the alloy compositions. The multiple correlation coefficient was found to be R = 0.84; this indicates that alloy composition has a considerable relationship with the number of TMF cycles to failure. It was also found that the addition of Co, Ru and Al is effective to improve the TMF property. In addition, another multiple regression analysis was also carried out for the correlation between the number of TMF cycles to failure among high temperature mechanical properties and microstructural parameters.

TI Complicated hollow turbine blades and surface grain refinement process
SO CHINA FOUNDRY
AB The control of grain size in superalloys is critical in the manufacture of gas turbine blades. The aim of the present research is to provide the technology for producing complicated hollow turbine blades with fine surface grains and better comprehensive mechanical properties. By melt superheating treatment and coating the internal surfaces of shell mould using a cobalt aluminate-bearing coating material, the influence of cobalt aluminate as inoculant on the surface grain sizes of turbine blade was studied with addition of cobalt aluminate: 0, 35%, 45% - 65% and 100% respectively. At the same time, the effects of cooling circumstances of the blades on surface grain sizes were also experimented under the same addition of cobalt aluminate. The results showed that the melt superheating treatment plays a significant role in the grain size and carbide morphology; and fine surface grains were obtained when the internal surfaces of shell mould were coated using cobalt aluminate coatings. When the addition of cobalt aluminate in coating is between 45% - 65%, and the melt is poured into preheated shell moulds with fine silica sand as backing sand, the blades satisfied the surface grain size requirement is over 90%. In addition, comparisons of the surface grain size and the mechanical properties were also conducted between home-made and foreign-made blades.
