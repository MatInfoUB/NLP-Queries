TI Evaluation of High Temperature Oxidation Behaviour of Nanostructured
   Cr/Co-Al Coatings
SO OXIDATION OF METALS
AB The high temperature oxidation behavior of sputtered Cr/Co-Al coatings fabricated by DC/RF magnetron sputtering on a superalloy substrate has been studied in the present work. The microstructural features and phase formation of the as-deposited coatings were characterized by FE-SEM, AFM, and XRD, respectively. Weight-change measurements were made to calculate the cyclic oxidation kinetics of the coated superalloy exposed to air at 900 degrees C. It was observed that the corrosion rate of sputtered Cr/Co-Al coated superalloy is lower than that of the uncoated superalloy owing to the formation of continuous, dense, adherent and protective oxide scales over the surface of the coatings. The protective oxide scales in the corroded coatings were basically the thin layer of Cr2O3, CoO, Al2O3 and CoCr2O4, which provide protection to the base superalloy at high temperature.

AB Two Ni(Co)CrAlY coatings were deposited by EB-PVD method on a DS superalloy of Ni-Al-Cr-Co-W-Mo-Ta-Hf system. SEM, XEDS and XRD were used to study the oxidation behavior of the coatings. The two coatings show a good protection for the DS superalloy. The results of the isothermal oxidation test at 1 150 degrees C for 100 h show that the oxidation tendency obeys the parabolic law, and the oxidation rate constant K-p of the coated specimens decreases to about 1/3 of that for the bare superalloy. After oxidation, a continuous alumina-based scale is formed at the surfaces of the coated samples. Y2O3, NiO and SiO2 are also detectable in the oxide scale. A large number of Al in the coating is consumed due to high-temperature diffusion and oxidation reactions, and the NiAl phases in the coating are almost completely transformed to Ni3Al phases. For the Hf-bearing coating, some HfO2 particles exist at the interface between the coating and the substrate. Although internal oxidation occurs, the coating still shows a good adhesion with the superalloy substrate even after oxidation for 100 h. For the bare DS superalloy, after 100 h oxidation at 1 150 degrees C, only discontinuous alumina-based oxide particles exist on the surface. Oxide spallation occurs for the bare alloy.

TI Oxidation of a Co-base Superalloy
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB The oxidation behavior of a cast polycrystalline Co-base superalloy was studied at temperatures from 900 to 1050 degrees C and analyzed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results indicate that a cast Co-base superalloy follows the subparabolic oxidation kinetics at 900 and 1000 degrees C, which are controlled by the growth of the inner Cr-rich layer, and that after oxidation at 1050 degrees C for 200 h, it almost exhibits the linear oxidation kinetics possible due to the volatility of Cr-rich oxide. A mixed scale forms on the alloy after prolonged oxidation. The oxide scale formed at 900 and 1000 degrees C is composed of an outer layer of spinel and an inner continuous Cr-rich layer and at 1050 degrees C is composed of a very discontinuous Cr-rich layer.

TI Study of high temperature oxidation kinetics of Co-Al coating on
   superalloy
SO SURFACE ENGINEERING
AB Nanostructured Co-Al coating on Superni-718 substrate was deposited by dc/rf magnetron sputtering. The high temperature oxidation kinetics of Co-Al coating on superalloy substrate was studied after 100 h of cyclic oxidation in air environment at 700-900 degrees C. FE-SEM/EDS, AFM and XRD were used to characterise the microstructure, surface morphology and phase constituents of as deposited and oxidised coatings. The results indicate that the Co-Al coated superalloy substrate has higher oxidation resistance at 900 degrees C. The presence of beta-CoAl intermetallic phase in the Co-Al coating, the formation of Al2O3 and spinel phases such as CoCr2O4 and CoAl2O4 in the oxide scale are considered to be the reasons for the higher oxidation resistance shown by the Co-Al coated superalloy substrate after 100 h of cyclic oxidation in air at 900 degrees C. Further, the oxide scale formed on the coated sample exhibits good spallation resistance during cyclic oxidation test at 900 degrees C.

The present study aims to characterization of new gamma-gamma' Co-10Al-5Mo-2Nb (at.%) cobalt-based superalloy performance in terms of the high-temperature exposure under cyclic conditions, with particular regard to surface condition. Specimens were tested in cycles of high-temperature exposition (25, 50, 75, 100 and 150 h) in air environment at 800 A degrees C. Detailed analysis of oxidized surfaces by scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction was made at various intervals during testing. The cyclic oxidation behavior of new alloy was compared to the basic Co-9Al-9W (at.%) Co-based superalloy.

SO OXIDATION OF METALS
AB A surface-morphology change has been observed for an aluminide coating on the Go-base superalloy DZ40M during oxidation at 1100 degrees C in air. The oxide formed on the coating remained an even greyish-white color during the stable oxidation stage, whereas, dark-colored corrosion nodules were observed when oxidation of the coating accelerated. The number of nodules increased with time, along with growth of the nodules, eventually covering the entire surface which signified failure.

TI The main degradation modes of an aluminide coating on a Co-base
   superalloy during high-temperature oxidation in air
SO OXIDATION OF METALS
AB Degradation of aluminide coatings occurs by two ways, one by coating oxidation, and the other by interdiffusion of Al. In this paper, the structure variation and phase transformation are analyzed for the aluminide coating on a newly developed Co-base superalloy (DZ40M alloy) after oxidation at 900 and 1000degreesC in air. The results show that degradation of this coating was mainly by oxidation at 900degreesC, but principally by interdiffusion at 1000degreesC. The main degradation mode of the coating is primarily dependent on the oxidation temperature and the specific structure of the coating itself.

TI Activation Energy of Oxidation of Novel Co-Al-W Superalloys at High
   Temperatures
SO RARE METAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING
AB Co-Al-W alloy is a novel Co-base superalloy, with the precipitation strengthening phase of ternary compound gamma'-Co(3)(Al,W). The kinetic data of oxidation mass gain were measured for the Co-Al-W alloy at 800 and 900 degrees C in air, and the oxidation rate constants at different temperatures were determined by the relevant linear fitting. According to Arrhenius relation of the oxidation rate constants, the activation energy of oxidation was derived for this alloy at 800 and 900 degrees C. It is found that 9W alloy has the highest value of activation energy of oxidation among 7.5W, 9W and 10.7W at different temperatures. The addition of refractory elements Mo, Nb, Ta and Ti can change the mass gain and activation energy of oxidation of the Co-Al-W alloy; therefore, the oxidation resistance of the superalloy at high temperatures can be forecast.

AB A new polycrystalline gamma'-strengthened cobalt-base superalloy with improved oxidation resistance up to 1100 degrees C is presented. Based on the Co-Al-W-Ni-Cr-Ti system, the chemistry was optimized via computational thermodynamics, and an 18 kg ingot was successfully melted under vacuum and processed. During cyclic oxidation trials at 800 degrees C, 1000 degrees C, and 1100 degrees C, the Co-base superalloy gained significantly less mass per surface area than the benchmark Waspaloy tested in similar conditions. X-ray diffraction and EDS analysis of the oxidized surface showed that a continuous layer of Al2O3 forms between the substrate and the external oxides, providing the necessary oxidation resistance.

SO TRANSACTIONS OF THE INDIAN INSTITUTE OF METALS
AB The microstructural characterizations and high temperature oxidation of magnetron sputtered Co-Al coatings on the superalloy substrate have been studied in the present work. FE-SEM/EDS and XRD were used to characterize the morphology and formation of different phases in the coatings, respectively. Thermo gravimetric technique was used to investigate the oxidation of the coatings, in air at 900A degrees C. The growth kinetics of the oxide layers was predicted using weight change of the coated sample measured during oxidation. It was found that the oxidation rate of Co-Al coated superalloy was lower than that uncoated superalloy due to the formation of continuous dense, adherent and protective oxide scale such as CoO, Al2O3, Cr2O3, CoCr2O4, and CoAl2O4 over the surface of the coatings exposed to air at high temperature oxidation, 900A degrees C. The microstructural features and phases of the oxidised coatings were used to elucidate the mechanism of high temperature oxidation.

AB The oxidation behavior of the single crystal Ni-based superalloy TMS-82+ was studied under cyclic condition at 900 and 1000 degrees C for 200 h in air. The oxidation kinetics for the superalloy at both exposure temperatures was explained by the subparabolic relationship. The results show that increasing the exposure temperature from 900 to 1 000 degrees C, the amounts of alpha-A1(2)O(3), (Ni, Co)Al2O4 and NiCr2O4 increase, resulting in a higher mass gain. The oxides consist of (Ni, Co)O, CrTaO4, AlTaO4, Cr2O3, theta-, alpha-Al2O3 and (Ni, Co)Al2O4 in the specimen at 900 degrees C, but NiCr2O4 spinel forms for the specimen exposed at 1000 degrees C except the above mentioned oxides. A continuous alpha-Al2O3 layer is responsible for a slow growth rate of the scale after an initial rapid oxidation of NiO.

TI Effect of Pre-Oxidation on High Temperature Oxidation and Corrosion
   Behavior of Co-Al-W-Based Superalloy
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB In 2006, stable gamma' phase was found in Co-Al-W alloy, which provides a new way for developing Co-based superalloys. In order to meet the requirements for applications, the Co-Al-W-based superalloys need to have good oxidation and corrosion resistance. But the oxidation and corrosion resistance of the Co-Al-W-based superalloys is relatively low. In this work, pre-oxidation treatments were to improve the oxidation and corrosion resistance. Three types of pre-oxidation treatments were carried out at 900 degrees C (in air), 950 degrees C (in air) and 1000 degrees C (in 1%O-2 +99%Ar), which were marked as 900-PreO, 950-PreO and 1000-LPreO, respectively. High temperature oxidation tests of both the pre-oxidation treated and untreated superalloys were carried out at 1000 degrees C. And hot corrosion behaviors were also investigated at both 800 and 850 degrees C. XRD, SEM and EDS were used to examine the characteristics of the oxidation and corrosion behaviors. The results show that the pre-oxide layers of the superalloys after different pre-oxidation treatments are compact. During oxidation at 1000 degrees C, the Cr2O3 scale in 900-PreO treated superalloy is oxidized to form volatile products, and the diffusion resistance of both oxygen and the metal elements through the oxide layer is poor. In 1000-LPreO treated superalloy, serious spallation of the oxides occurs and leads to poor oxidation resistance. In 950-PreO treated superalloy, since the continuous CoCr2O4 and Al2O3 scales help to reduce the diffusion of oxygen and the metal elements, the mass gain of 950-PreO treated superalloy is consequently decreased. During the hot corrosion process, the preoxide layer of 950-PreO treated superalloy can hinder the diffusion of corrosive medium. Therefore, the corrosion resistance can be significantly improved by 950-PreO treatment, and the mass gain is decreased by over 80%.

TI Cyclic oxidation behavior of aluminide coatings on the Co-base
   superalloy DZ40M
SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB Aluminide coatings are prepared on a new Co-base superalloy DZ40M by low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LP-CVD), and their cyclic oxidation behavior is investigated. The results show that the coating degradation primarily results from Al-depleting to heal the oxide scale on the outer surface during the cyclic oxidation, unlike that primarily from inward Al diffusion to the substrate during the isothermal process. The effect of Ti on the oxidation resistance is very different for various intermetallic alloys, and the addition of Ti will increase the degradation for the present coating during high-temperature oxidation. These experimental results are helpful to clarify the understanding of the Ti-modification effect on aluminide coatings for Co-based superalloys. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The lifetime and interdiffusion behavior of the Co-Al coating on the Ni-based superalloy at 1050 degrees C, 1075 degrees C and 1100 degrees C were investigated. Surface oxidation and interdiffusion between the coating and the substrate led to depletion of Al in the coating, and beta-Ni(Co)Al was gradually degraded into gamma and gamma' phases. Oxidation activation energy of the coating was calculated through oxidation weight gain curves of different temperatures. The formula of the coating lifetime related to the coating thickness and the temperature was established by calculating intermediate parameters. The lifetime determined by the formula and experiment showed good agreement. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The result indicates that the coatings of these three kinds of alloys are white austenite base and Cr7C3 and Cr-7(C, B)(3) eutectic; Co-02 produces Cr2O3 oxidation protection film, and there were distinct areas with shortage of chromium in Co-04 and NDCo-02 coatings where CoCr2O4 and NiCr2O4 oxidation protection films were produced with spinel structure, these efficiently improved oxidation resistance; these three kinds of alloys have super oxidation resistance which increases according to NDCo-02,Co-04 and Co-02 orderly. The level of oxidation resistance was assessed.

TI Electrochemical characterisation of novel gamma/gamma '-strengthened
   Co-base superalloys
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB Electrochemical behaviour of a new gamma/gamma'-strengthened Co-base superalloy with the composition Co-9Al-9W-0.12B (in at%) was studied in comparison with pure Co at room temperature in 1 M Na2SO4 (pH 5.9) and 0.1 M NaOH (pH 12.8) aqueous solutions. Pure Co and the Co-base superalloy show passive behaviour in both solutions. Impedance spectra measured at the corrosion potential indicate comparable impedance values for the alloy and pure Co in neutral solution, but in alkaline solution the alloy shows a lower corrosion rate. Polarisation curves indicate a limited range of passivity for both materials in neutral solution. In alkaline solution, the alloy and pure Co show similar (albeit not identical) primary and secondary ranges of passivity, as previously described in the literature for pure Co. Furthermore, lower passive current densities are observed for the superalloy in the primary range of passivity. As the superalloy studied in this work is a promising material for high temperature applications, we moreover compared the corrosion behaviour of oxidised alloy surfaces with the bare alloy surface. For this, isothermal oxidation of the gamma/gamma'-strengthened Co-base superalloy was carried out in air at 800 degrees C and 900 degrees C for 24 h and 500 h. Compared to unoxidised Co-Al-W-B alloys and pure Co samples, the high temperature oxide scales provide orders of magnitude higher protection with good barrier properties in a potential range between -1 and +2V (vs. Ag/AgCl). In general, longer oxidation times and a higher oxidation temperature result in the formation of more protective oxide layers. The protective effect of the high temperature oxide layers is discussed in view of their thickness and chemical composition. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Oxidation Behavior of a Ni-Base Superalloy in Air at 800 degrees C
SO JOURNAL OF IRON AND STEEL RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL
AB A new nickel-based superalloy was oxidized in air at 800 degrees C for period up to 100 h has been studied. Its oxidation behaviors were investigated by means of TGA, XRD and SEM(EDAX). The results show the kinetic curve of alloy oxidized obeyed the parabolic rate law. The oxidation scales consisted of Cr2O3, Al2O3, (Ni,Co)Cr2O4, AlWO3, AlTaO4, CrTaO4 and CoWO4 and intermal oxides. The phase rich in Ta and Al inhibited O and other elements of superalloy diffusion in the oxidation film. The oxidation kinetics was mainly controlled by Cr2O3 in the initial oxidation period, which is controlled predominantly by growth of the inner Al-rich oxide layer after the initial oxidation stage.

The results showed that the isothermal oxidation process of the coatings in air at 900-1100 degreesC has three stages, including the initial, the stable and the accelerative. Adding Ti into aluminisor quickened the oxidation and degradation of the coating, and made the oxidation stage advance from the stable to the accelerative. The oxidation weight gains of coatings at lower temperatures of 900 and 1000 degreesC with theta -Al2O3 emerging were more than that at higher temperature of 1050 degreesC with only alpha -Al2O3 forming.

   The optimum solubility index value was 1.5 and the addition of small amounts of Hf and Co increased oxidation resistance greatly and creep rupture strength slightly.
   The finally developed alloy SC-83K which contains 0.1% Hf and 1% Co has much higher creep rupture strength than conventional alloys as well as good structural stability and oxidation resistance.

TI High temperature degradation behavior of sputtered nanostructured Co-Al
   coatings on superalloy
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB Microstructure and cyclic high temperature oxidation behavior of nanostructured Co-Al coatings on Superni-718 substrate have been investigated. Cyclic high temperature oxidation tests were conducted on uncoated and coated samples at peak temperatures of 800 degrees C and 900 degrees C for up to 100 thermal cycles between the peak and room temperatures. The results showed that bare substrate has higher oxidation resistance at 800 degrees C as compared to 900 degrees C and coated sample has slightly higher oxidation resistance at 900 degrees C. The external scale of both coated sample exhibited good spallation resistance during cyclic oxidation testing at both temperatures. The improvement in oxide scale spallation resistance is believed to be related to the fine-grained structure of the coating. Nanostructured Co-Al coatings on Superni-718 substrate were deposited by DC/ RF magnetron sputtering. FE-SEM/ EDS and XRD were used to characterize the morphology and formation of different phases in the coatings, respectively. The Co-Al coating on superalloy substrate showed better performance of cyclic high temperature oxidation resistance due to its possession of beta-CoAl phase as Al reservoir and the formation of Al2O3 and spinel phases such as CoCr2O4 and CoAl2O4 in the scale. The oxidation results confirmed an improved oxidation resistance of the Co-Al coating on superalloy as compared to bare substrate up to 100 cycles. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Hot Corrosion Behavior of a Novel Co-base Superalloy in Molten NaCl at
   900 degrees C
SO CAILIAO GONGCHENG-JOURNAL OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING
AB Hot corrosion behavior of a new cobalt-base superalloy at 900 degrees C in the molten NaCl was investigated by salt-leaching method. The results show that the selective oxidation occurs at the initial stage of corrosion, and the oxidation films including Al2O3, Cr2O3 and a small amount of TiO2 are formed on the surface of the superalloy. However, the protective Cr2O3 and Al2O3 are corroded by the molten NaCl and then the substrate is exposed to the corrosive substances, so that the corrosion rate is accelerated. During the corrosion, rod Al2O3 is formed in inner corrosion layer, and then Co-3 W is easily formed around Al2O3 owing to the depletion of Al element in the matrix. As a result, a fast path for O diffusion is formed in the interface between Co-3 W and rod Al2O3 phase, resulting in the increase of hot corrosion rate after 80h.

The results indicated that this alloy can grow a protective oxide scale at 900 and 1000 degrees C during isothermal oxidation, but not at 1100 degrees C because of serious cracking cmd spalling of the oxide scales. Moreover, an internal-precipitate zone formed in the subsurface region of the alloy at all temperatures and times. The precipitates, were rich in Cr in the vicinity of the ahoy-scale interface and rich in Al deep in the alloy. The internal-precipitate morphology changed from a granular to needlelike shape with increasing oxidation temperature.

AB The cyclic oxidation behavior of aluminide coatings made by low-pressure chemical vapor deposition on to a new Co-base superalloy DZ40M has been investigated. It was found that these coatings bonded well to the matrix well. Coating degradation when it occurs is due primarily to a depleting Al-source as the oxide scale on outer surface is heated during cyclic oxidation. This degradation will be accelerated if Ti is added to the aluminizing reagent during deposition.

AB Aluminization has been employed on alloys to form dense and adhesive Al2O3 surface layers to prolong their service life at high temperature. A cobalt-base superalloy AMS 5608 was used to deposit a cobalt aluminide layer at 950 degrees C for 9 h by a pack cementation process. The cyclic oxidation tests on aluminized alloys and the untreated substrate were conducted at 1100 degrees C for 196 h. It is found that the cobalt aluminide phase (around 60 gm in thickness) is achieved. A continuous Cr-W rich intermetallic layer is formed in the interdiffusion zone. After cyclic oxidation test, a dense and protective Al2O3 surface layer is produced on the aluminized alloy and phase transformation reactions occur in the aluminide layer and interdiffusion zone. It is observed that the aluminizing process has greatly enhanced the cyclic oxidation resistance of the Co-base superalloy at 1100 degrees C. However, the inward diffusion of Al and formation of cracks and pores in the interdiffusion zone cause detrimental effects on the cyclic oxidation resistance of the superalloy for long-term exposure.

AB The formation and phase transformation of simple aluminide and Ti-modifided aluminide coatings (by low pressure gas phase deposition) on the Co-base superalloy DZ40Mduring production and high temperature oxidation have been investigated. The results show that the deposition coatings consist of an outer layer of CoAl phase and an internal layer of Cr-rich carbide girdle. Phase transformations in the coatings high temperature take place as follows: CoAl-->CoAl(majority) + alpha-Co-->alpha-Co (majority)+ CoAl-->alpha-Co. The appearance of alpha-Co indicates the beginning of degradation. The degradation will be over when all of CoAl changes into alpha-Co. The Ti addition decreases the activity of Al, and significantly reduces the Al content and the thickness of the coatings, and accelerates its degradation.

The oxides on the specimen at 800 degrees C consisted of (Ni,Co)O, CrTaO4, AlTaO4, Cr2O3, and theta-Al2O3, whereas for the specimen exposed at 900 degrees C, spinels of NiCr2O4 and (Ni,Co)Al2O4 as well as alpha-Al2O3 were observed. An innermost dense alpha-Al2O3 layer was responsible for a stable growth rate of the scale after the initial rapid oxidation.

SO CORROSION SCIENCE
AB Arc ion plating had been employed on a cobalt-base superalloy K40S to deposit a NiCrAlYSi coating to improve its oxidation resistance at 1323-1423 K in air. The K40S superalloy had poor oxidation resistance because a non-protective and easy spalling surface oxides scale mixed of Cr2O3 and CoCr2O4 was formed on its surface. After coated with NiCrAlYSi coating, a dense and protective alpha-Al2O3 scale was formed on the coating and excellently improved its oxidation resistance. Inter-diffusion obviously occurred between the coating and the substrate K40S superalloy in oxidation process, which resulted from Co atoms in K40S outwards diffused. A richen Cr and W carbides inter-diffusion layer was formed, which could acted as a diffusion barrier that barred Al atoms in coating inwards diffusion. Though the NiCrAlYSi changed into NiCoCrAlYSi during oxidation process, it still possessed a good oxidation resistance and. had a considerable long-term life. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The microstructure and high temperature oxidation behavior of Co-Cr-Y2O3 modified pack aluminide coatings on Ni-based superalloy GH586 were investigated. The results show that the specific Co-Cr-Y2O3 modified aluminide coating has a mass gain of only 0.36 mg/cm(2) after oxidation at 1000 degrees C for 100 h, which is much less than that of the substrate at 1000 degrees C. From X-ray diffraction, the phase of the coatings is mainly AINi, and after oxidation at 1000 degrees C for 100 h the denser oxidation scale is composed of Al2O3, Cr2O3, and CoCr2O4. Surface and cross sectional morphologies were characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM). The coating exhibits a better resistance to high temperature oxidation, compared to the oxidation film of GH586 without coating. Moreover, the growing Cr (W) rich phase is gradually gathered at the grain boundaries during the oxidation, and it is beneficial to providing more Cr element for the dense oxidation film, which is mainly attributed to the excellent high temperature oxidation resistance.

SO RARE METAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING
AB Novel Co-Al-W superalloy is a novel Co-base superalloy, with the precipitation strengthening by a ternary compound gamma'-Co-3(Al,W) phase on gamma-Co matrix. The effect of alloying element Mo, Nb, Ta and Ti on friction and wear performance of Co-Al-W superalloys at room temperature was studied by THT07-135 type friction and wear tester and SEM, and cobalt-based Stellite 6 alloy was employed for comparison. Results show that the friction coefficient of 9.8W superalloy is smaller than that of cobalt-based Stellite 6. Alloying elements Mo, Nb and Ti can moderately reduce wear mass loss and friction coefficient of 9.8W superalloy, and improve the wear resistance. The Mo, Ti and Nb elements can clearly improve the wear resistance of 9.8W superalloy while the effect of Ta element is not obvious. The wear mechanism of Co-Al-W superalloy is mainly oxidation and abrasive wear, while that of Stellite 6 alloy mainly is delamination and abrasive wear.

SO CORROSION SCIENCE
AB Isothermal oxidation in air was carried out on a gamma'-strengthened single crystalline Co-Al-W-B superalloy at 800, 900, and 1000 degrees C. The absence of grain boundaries leads to inferior oxidation properties at 800 and 900 degrees C, and improved properties at 1000 degrees C, compared to a polycrystalline alloy of the same composition. At lower temperatures, grain boundary diffusion is dominant and assumed to be the reason for enhanced B-accumulation in the inner oxide layer and enhanced formation of the protective inner Al2O3 layer. However, at 1000 degrees C superior oxidation resistance of the single crystalline superalloy can be observed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI High temperature oxidation behaviour of Cr/Co-Al coated superalloy
SO SURFACE ENGINEERING
AB The high temperature oxidation behaviour of nanostructured Cr/Co-Al coatings on Superni-718 substrate, deposited by sputtering, has been investigated. Cyclic high temperature oxidation tests were conducted on bare and coated samples at 900 degrees C for up to 100 cycles. The results showed that a dense scale formed on the coated samples during thermal cycling at the peak temperature of 900 degrees C. The external scale exhibited good spallation resistance during cyclic oxidation testing. The improvement in oxide scale spallation resistance is believed to be the fine grained structure of the coating. The Cr/Co-Al coating on the superalloy substrate showed better performance of cyclic high temperature oxidation resistance due to its possession of beta-CoAl phase as Al reservoir and the formation of Al2O3 and spinel phases, such as CoCr2O4 and CoAl2O4, in the scale.

TI Oxidation behavior and breakdown of an aluminide coating on DZ40M alloy
   at high temperatures
SO OXIDATION OF METALS
AB DZ40M alloy is a new Co-base superalloy, which is suitable for the blade material of gas turbines. In this paper, isothermal oxidation of an aluminide coating on this alloy was examined at 900-1100 degreesC in air, it was observed that the weight gain at lower temperatures (900 and 1000 degreesC) was greater than that at the higher temperature (1050 degreesC), which was due to the formation of both theta -Al2O3 and alpha -Al2O3 at 900 and 1000 degreesC but only alpha -Al2O3 at 1050 and 1100 degreesC.

TI Oxidation behaviour and mechanism of a cobalt based superalloy between
   1050 and 1250 degrees C
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB A new Co-base superalloy 22Co-21Ni-23Fe-29Cr-2.2Nb (Co22 for short) was developed, and the influence of a trace amount of rare earth (RE) on the oxidation resistance was investigated. Isothermal oxidation behaviour of this Co-base superalloy was investigated at 1050-1250 degrees C in air, analyzed with scanning electronic microscopy and X-ray diffraction. The results show that oxidation mass gain of the samples with or without RE elements obeyed secondary parabolic law, and the effect of 0.03 wt.% RE on oxidation resistance is small. The oxidation rate constant of the 0.03 wt.% RE added Co22 alloy decreases by about 6.1% to 9.0% compared to that of the Co22 alloy without RE. Oxidation at 1050-1250 degrees C for 100 h results in the formation of MnCr2O4, Cr2O3 and SiO2. A continuous and protective MnCr2O4 spinel layer forms as outer layer. The continuous middle oxide layer is confirmed to be Cr2O3, and the innermost layer consists of discontinuous SiO2. The outer and middle layers strongly improve oxidation resistance and oxide layer adhesion because of their continuity and compactness, and the innermost SiO2 layer forms a diffusion barrier to prevent further oxidation. Formation and growth mechanisms of oxide layers were also discussed. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI High temperature oxidation behavior of electron beam smelted K417
   superalloy
SO VACUUM
AB The high temperature oxidation behavior of electron beam smelted K417 superalloy were investigated at 800 degrees C, 900 degrees C and 1000 degrees C. The results showed that the oxidation resistance of the K417 superalloy is improved after electron beam smelting due to its resulting large grain-boundary density and low impurity content. The secondary dendrite arm spacing of K417 after electron beam smelting is approximately 42.9 mu m, which is finer than that approximately 100.0 mu m of the raw material. The O and N element contents were reduced by 50% and 67%, respectively. The oxidation kinetics were controlled by the oxidation reaction of Cr and Ti in the early stage, and subsequently it was determined by the oxidation behavior of Al. The oxide film consisted of three layers: an external layer composed of TiO2, Cr2O(3), Al2O3 and a small amount of (Ni,Co) Cr2O4; a middle layer that included TiO2, Cr2O(3), Al2O3 and trace amounts of TIVO4; and an inner layer that contained Al2O3 exclusively. An oxidation mechanism of the K417 superalloy is proposed that involves the diffusion of metal ions and O-2-at elevated temperatures.

SO JOURNAL OF THERMAL ANALYSIS AND CALORIMETRY
AB The aim of the study is characterization of high-temperature oxidation behavior of new Co-based superalloys by thermogravimetry (TG). The following alloys have been taken into account: Co-9Al-9W, Co-20-Ni-7Al-7W, Co-10Al-5Mo-2Nb and Co-20Ni-10Al-5Mo-2Nb (at.%). The thermogravimetric analysis was carried out in the temperature range 40-1200 degrees C of heating rate 5 degrees min(-1). The investigation was performed using the thermal analyzer NETZSCH STA 449 F3 Jupiter. TG-DTG plots showed oxidation behavior up to 1200 degrees C and indicated the temperatures of further isothermal oxidation examinations. The oxidation behavior of basic Co-9Al-9W (at.%) alloy was compared to W-free Co-10Al-5Mo-2Nb and Co-20Ni-10Al-5Mo-2Nb (at.%) alloys. The obtained data showed different oxidation behavior dependably on the type of alloying elements. Moreover, the effect of Ni addition on oxidation performance was determined. The scales grown on Co-base superalloys after thermogravimetry were evaluated by means of scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy.

TI Oxidation Behavior of the Niobium-Modified MAR-M247 Superalloy at 1,000
   A degrees C in Air
SO OXIDATION OF METALS
AB MAR-M247 superalloy has excellent mechanical properties and oxidation resistance. The aim of this work was to evaluate the oxidation behavior of a Nb-modified MAR-M247 superalloy (10.2 wt% Co; 10.2 W; 8.5 Cr; 5.6 Al; 1.6 Nb; 1.4 Hf; 1.1 Ti; 0.7 Mo; 0.15 C; 0.06 Zr; 0.02 B; Ni balance). The samples were subjected to oxidation tests in air at 1,000 A degrees C up to 240 h and the weight gain was measured every 24 h. The material in the as-cast condition as well as those from the oxidation tests were characterized with the aid of SEM/EDS and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The results showed that the n value and the parabolic rate constant (k) for the MAR-M247(Nb) superalloy at 1,000 A degrees C were about 0.1 and 2.8 x 10(-8) mg(2)cm(-4)s(-1), respectively. The microstructural characterization showed the formation of NiO oxides in the outer layer, Cr2O3, TiO2, CoO, (Ni,Co)Cr2O4 spinels, W20O58 and HfO2 particles in the intermediate layer and Al2O3 in the inner layer and in the gamma' depleted zone of the material.

TI Microstructural Evolution of Oxidation Film on a Single Crystal
   Nickel-Based Superalloy at 980 A degrees C
SO OXIDATION OF METALS
AB The isothermal oxidation behavior of a single crystal nickel-based superalloy was investigated at 980 A degrees C through XRD, SEM/EDX and EPMA. The mass gain process exhibited two periods: an initial stage followed by a steady-state stage. Based on the experimental results, the rapid formation of alumina and NiO was responsible for the initial stage of mass gain, and the formation of complex spinels phases may dramatically effect on the steady stage. The microstructure of oxidation film, from the top surface down to the base material, was clarified as Ni-rich oxides, Ni-Cr oxides, Cr-Ta-Co oxides, Ni-Al oxides and finally a continuous Al2O3. In addition, AlN formed in the gamma'-free zone. The effect of oxidation film evolution on the oxidation kinetics and mechanism were discussed.

TI First approach for thermodynamic modelling of the high temperature
   oxidation behaviour of ternary gamma '-strengthened Co-Al-W superalloys
SO CORROSION SCIENCE
AB In the present work, thermodynamic modelling of the high temperature oxidation behaviour of a gamma'-strengthened Co-base superalloy is presented. The ternary Co-9Al-9W alloy (values in at%) was isothermally oxidised for 500 h at 800 and 900 degrees C in air. Results reveal that the calculated oxide layer sequence (Thermo-Calc, TCNI6) is in good agreement with the formed oxide scales on the alloy surface. Furthermore, prediction of the influence of oxygen partial pressure on Al2O3 formation is presented. The modelling results indicate pathways for alloy development or possible pre-oxidation surface treatments for improved oxidation resistance of the material. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The cyclic oxidation and interdiffusion behaviour of the coatings at 1200 degrees C were investigated. As compared to the single-doped coating, the co-doped coating revealed suppressed interdiffusion and delayed beta-gamma' phase transformation. Simultaneously, the interfacial voids formation and scale rumpling were inhibited. As a result, the thermally grown oxide (TGO) grown on the co-doped coating exhibited improved adherence and the roles of Pt and Hf in low-Pt/Hf co-doped coating were discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

A small amount of oxide scale spallation happened during the oxidation at 950 degrees C. The analysis of the specimens after oxidized at 950 degrees C revealed that three oxide layers formed, including the outer layer consisting of TiO2 and CrTiO3, the middle layer consisting of Cr2O3, Ni(Cr2O4) and TiO2 phases, and internal oxidizing layers identified as Al2O3 phase (C) 2011 Published Elsevier Ltd.

SO RARE METAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING
AB A new nickel-based superalloy was oxidized in air at 950degreesC and 1000degreesC for time up to 140 h. Its oxidation behaviors were investigated by means of TGA, XRD and SEM(EDX). The kinetic curve of alloy oxidized at 950degreesC for 128 h obeys the parabolic rate law and no oxide peels off. The parabolic law is almost followed when alloy is oxidized at 1 000degreesC. A small amount of oxide scale spallation happens in the course of oxidation at 1 000degreesC. The oxide scales consist of Cr2O3,(Ni,Co)Cr2O4, TiO2, SiO2 and Al2O3, and internal oxidation takes place both at 950degreesC and at 1 000degreesC. This new alloy exhibits higher resistance to oxidation at 950degreesC than that at 1 000degreesC. The oxidation mechanism of the alloy has also been suggested by the phase composition analyses of oxide layers.

The external scale exhibited good spallation resistance during cyclic oxidation testing at both temperatures. The improvement in oxide scale spallation resistance is believed to be related to the fine-grained structure of the coating. Nanostructured Co-Al coatings on Superni-718 substrate were deposited by DC/RF magnetron sputtering. FE-SEM/EDS, AFM, and XRD were used to characterize the morphology and formation of different phases in the coatings, respectively. The Co-Al coating on superalloy substrate showed better performance of cyclic high temperature oxidation resistance due to its possession of beta-CoAl phase as Al reservoir and the formation of Al2O3 and spinel phases such as CoCr2O4 and CoAl2O4 in scale. The oxidation results confirmed an improved oxidation resistance of the Co-Al coating on superalloy as compare to bare substrate in air at 900 degrees C temperature up to 100 cycles.

TI Improvement of the Oxidation Resistance of the Single-Crystal Ni-Based
   TMS-82+Superalloy by Ni-Al Coatings with/without the Diffusion Barrier
SO OXIDATION OF METALS
AB Oxidation behavior of the uncoated base, Ni-Al coated and Re-Cr-Ni plus Ni-Al coated single-crystal (SC) Ni-based TMS-82+ superalloy is studied under cyclic air at 900 degrees C for 200 h to assess the oxidation resistance. Regardless of the coating processing, Ni-Al coating is effective in improving the oxidation resistance due to the formation of a continuous alpha-Al(2)O(3) a layer in the scale. For the uncoated base superalloy, the mass-gain curves are fitted by a subparabolic relationship, and complex oxide products including predominately NiO, some CrTaO(4), alpha-Al(2)O(3), Cr(2)O(3), a minor of spinels of (Ni, Co)Al(2)O(4), AlTaO(4) and theta-Al(2)O(3) are detected. Time-dependence of the oxide growth rate for both coated superalloy with/without the diffusion barrier is explained by the parabolic relationship. The oxide scales consist predominately of alpha-Al(2)O(3) and a minor of theta-Al(2)O(3). The diffusion barrier of sigma-phase plays a negligible effect on the oxidation resistance during

TI Isothermal Oxidation Behavior Characteristics of a Second Generation
   Ni-base Single Crystal Superalloy in Air at 1000 and 1100 degrees C
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTROCHEMICAL SCIENCE
AB The isothermal oxidation behavior of a second generation Ni-base single crystal superalloy was investigated in air at 1000 degrees C and 1100 degrees C. The microstructures of the oxide morphology and the cross-section area of the specimens after oxidation were analyzed by XRD and SEM/EDX. Indeed, the present results indicated that the Ni-base single crystal superalloy denoted the parabolic oxidation kinetics, which are primarily controlled by the growth of the inner alpha-Al2O3 layer. In conclusion, the scales formed on the surface of superalloy both at 1000 degrees C and 1100 degrees C were complex and can be classified into three different layers in general: an outer layer of NiO with a small amount of CoO, an intermediate layer which predominantly composed of spinels (Ni,Co) Al2O4, NiCr2O4, and accompanied with some other oxides such as CrTaO4, NiTiO3 as well as W20O58, and an inner continuous layer of alpha-Al2O3. Nevertheless, the poor Al zone was appeared between the oxide scales and the substrate after oxidation 200 h and 500 h both at 1000 degrees C and 1100 degrees C.

TI Influence of surface roughness on the oxidation behavior of a
   Ni-4.0Cr-5.7Al single crystal superalloy
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB The high-temperature oxidation dynamics and mechanisms of a Ni-based single crystal superalloy with four kinds of surface roughnesses were investigated by virtue of XRD, OM, SEM and EDS at 1000 degrees C. In the initial oxidation stage, outer (Ni, Co)O was mainly produced on the surfaces of the samples with Ra = 90 nm and 19 nm. Correspondingly, outer Cr2O3 and transient theta-Al2O3 were mainly formed on the surfaces with Ra = 509 nm and 182 nm. After 180 min oxidation, the values of instantaneous parabolic mass gain coefficients (k(p)) of the samples with all surface roughnesses were gradually consistent with the data of the growth parabolic coefficient of alpha-Al2O3. The oxidation mechanisms of Ni-based superalloy with different surface roughnesses were discussed by a model. The external diffusion flux of Al (D-Al) increases with the increases of surface roughness. Thus, the required Al concentration decreases with the increases of surface roughness when the selective oxidation of Al occurrs to form a protective single alpha-Al2O3 film. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

SO RARE METAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING
AB The high-temperature oxidation resistance of Co-Al-W alloy, strengthened by a ternary compound gamma'-Co-3(Al, W) phase, was investigated. The kinetic data of mass gain and the cyclic oxidation behavior of the Co-Al-W alloys, including Co-9Al-7.5W (7.5W), Co-9Al-9.8W (9.8W) and Co-9.2Al-10.7W (10.7W), were studied at 800 and 900 degrees C by XRD, SEM and EPMA technologies, and they were compared with a nickel-base Manaurite900 (MAN900) alloy. The results show that the anti-oxidative ability of 9.8W alloy is the best at 800 degrees C among these alloys. But at 900 degrees C the square of mass gain of 7.5W and 9.8W alloys are much greater, while the anti-oxidant property of MAN900 and 10.7W alloys are superior to other alloys. The oxide scales at 800 and 900 degrees C exhibit a multi-layered structure, including an outer layer of Co3O4, an intermediate layer composed of complex oxides of Co, Al and W elements layer, and an internal attacked layer with oxides of Co and Al.

TI The behavior of MCrAlY coatings on Ni3Al-base superalloy
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB This work is concerned with NiCrAlY and NiCoCrAlY coatings deposited on the superalloy IC-6 (Ni3Al-base superalloy) by arc ion plating (AIP). The results indicated that the presence of Al and Mo in alloy IC-6 impeded Cr atoms moving from coatings to substrates during the deposition process. As a consequence, the distribution of Cr is well proportioned in both NiCrAlY and NiCoCrAlY coatings. Vacuum heat treatment drastically increased diffusivities and the coating became more uniform. The interdiffusion also led to the phase transformation in the coatings. Although gamma'-Ni3Al and gamma-Ni were still the major phases in the coating, their lattice constant a(0) decreased. The results of isothermal oxidation showed that the oxidation behavior of coatings obeyed the parabolic rate law. The oxidation resistance was not influenced very much by the presence of Co in the NiCrAlY coating at 900 degreesC static atmosphere. NiCoCrAlY coating had poorer oxidation resistance than NiCrAlY coating when they were exposed at 1000 degreesC. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Phase Composition and Cracking Behavior on TIG Cladding Layer of
   Co-8.8Al-9.8W-0.2B Superalloy Based on JMatPro Software
SO RARE METAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING
AB Co-Al-W superalloy is a novel cobalt-based superalloy with the precipitation strengthening phase of ternary compound gamma-Co-3(Al,W). In order to study the cracking behavior of Co-8.8A1-9.8W-0.2B cladding layer on 304 stainless steel with TIG welding, the phase composition and relative contents at different positions of the cladding layer were investigated by thermodynamic simulation calculation of JMatPro software and experimental verification. The results show that the phase composition is the same at different positions of the cladding layer, but the content of those phases are not alike. Combining phase composition and contents of the cladding layer, the surface cracks of cladding layer are mainly hot cracks, which come from the integrated effect of the thermal stress, the phase transformation stress and the Laves phase.

TI MCrAlY coating design based on oxidation-diffusion modelling. Part I:
   Microstructural evolution
SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB To improve the efficiency of modern gas turbines, it is highly desired to develop durable MCrAlY alloys, to be used as protective coatings against oxidation and corrosion for superalloys which are the base materials for some hot components like turbine blades and vanes. In this paper, an oxidation-diffusion model was used to simulate the diffusion of alloying elements and the corresponding microstructural changes in different superalloy-coating systems at high temperature. Two important processes are considered in this model: oxidation of the coating and interdiffusion between the superalloy and the coating. The model showed an accurate predictability of the diffusion and microstructural evolution in real superalloy-coating diffusion couples studied at high-temperature exposure. The model was further applied to investigate the elemental effects of Ni, Co, Cr and Al on the microstructural evolution, considering the development of two important phases in superalloys and coatings, i.e. FCC-gamma' and BCC-beta, at different temperatures. The results in this paper deepen the knowledge of the MCrAlY coating design for superalloy-coating systems in high-temperature applications. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB The oxidation behavior of a single crystal Ni-based superalloy TMS-82+ was studied in cyclic air and water vapor (air plus 15% H(2)O) at 900 degrees C for 200 h. Oxidation kinetics was evaluated by mass gain measurements and the oxide scale was analysed by XRD, SEM and EDS, including the quantitative elemental concentration profiles by EPMA. Water vapor accelerated the growth rate of the oxides of NiO, Cr(2)O(3) and spinel of NiCr(2)O(4) due to the incursion of H, resulting in a higher mass gain and a thicker oxide scale with larger oxide gains of (Ni,Co)O.

TI Effect of nanocrystallization on the corrosion resistance of K38G
   superalloy in CO+CO2 atmospheres
SO OXIDATION OF METALS
AB The corrosion resistance of the cast superalloy K38G and a sputtered nanocrystalline coating of the same material was investigated in pure CO in the temperature range 850-1000 degrees C and in CO-20 vol.% CO2 at 900 degrees C. The cast K38G alloy formed Cr2O3 and TiO2 scales, and a zone of internal Al2O3 precipitation. Weight-gain kinetics followed the parabolic rate law under all conditions investigated. The sputtered K38G nanocrystalline coating, however, formed a single-phase Al2O3 scale and no internal-oxidation zone. The parabolic rate constants for nanocrystalline coating oxidation were about one order of magnitude smaller than those of the cast alloy. The changes in reaction morphology and rate are attributed to the more vapid grain-boundary diffusion of aluminum in the nanocrystalline material.

SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB A NiCoCrAlYHf coating was deposited onto a third generation single crystal superalloy DD10 by arc ion plating (AIP). In the present study, thermal cyclic oxidation and interdiffusion of NiCoCrAlYHf coating at 1100 degrees C were investigated to 1000 h. The coating surface, interface morphology and phase structure of the organization were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersion X ray spectroscopy (EDS) and X ray diffraction (XRD). An interdiffusion zone (IDZ) and a secondary reaction zone (SRZ) were formed after 300 h. Severe inward diffusion of Al, Co and Cr from NiCoCrAlYHf coating and outward diffusion of Ni and refractory elements such as Re and W from the superalloy occur at 1100 degrees C in air. The SRZ consisting of gamma, gamma ' and topologically closed-packed phase (TCP) was formed 60 mu m distance from the surface of coating in the superalloy after 300 h oxidation. Additionally, the development of IDZ and growth of the SRZ was also observed during thermal cyclic oxidation. Subsequently, interdiffusion coefficients of Al were presented by using a modified form of the Boltzmann-Matano analysis. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB Two Ni-Co-Cr-Al-Si-Y (M14 and M19) coatings with different Al and Cr contents were deposited onto DD32 Ni-base superalloy substrate using arc ion plating (AIP) method. The microstructures, isothermal oxidation behaviors at 1000 and 1100 degrees C and cyclic oxidation behaviors between room temperature and 1000 degrees C of the both coatings were investigated. The results show that these two coatings are composed of gamma'/gamma, beta-NiAl and some alpha-Cr precipitate phases. The only difference is that there are more beta-NiAl phase precipitates in M19 coating with high Al content. M19 coating, in contrast to M14 coating, can not only repair destroyed alumina scales effectively during isothermal oxidation, but also resist further cracking and spalling of alumina scales during cyclic oxidation. High Al content in M19 coating can be kept under long time oxidation, making M19 coating long-term service.

TI Compressive strain hold effect on high temperature low-cycle fatigue
   crack growth in superalloys
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL
AB Crack growth mechanisms taking into account the oxidation and mean stress effect in nickel- and cobalt-based superalloys were determined by crack growth tests using a strain waveform including compressive strain hold. Cracks were found to propagate on the dendrite boundary in both superalloys. Crack growth rates were increased by increasing the compressive hold time. Oxidation around the crack tip was detected by electron probe micro analysis (EPMA) and was found to accelerate the fatigue crack growth. The oxidation component in the normalized crack growth rate by oxidation is proportional to about the 1/3 power of loading frequency for Ni-based superalloy, whereas the power for Co-based superalloy is about 1/2. Furthermore, mean stresses in the nickel-based superalloy, which has a high proof strength even at high temperature, were increased by the compressive strain hold. It was also found that increasing the mean stress accelerates the crack growth. A crack growth model that considers effects of both oxidation at crack the tip and mean stress was discussed from these test results.

TI Influence of orientation-dependent grain boundary oxidation on fatigue
   cracking behaviour in an advanced Ni-based superalloy
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Fatigue tests have been conducted on an advanced disc Ni-based superalloy [low solvus, high refractory (LSHR) alloy] at 650 degrees C in air under three-point bend loading to investigate the role of orientation-dependent grain boundary (GB) oxidation in crack initiation and early propagation. It is found that crack initiation occurs mainly from bulged GB oxides, and cracks then predominantly propagate along the oxidised grain boundaries. These bulged oxides are extremely enriched in Co and preferentially form at the boundaries between high and low Schmid factor grains which are inclined normal to the applied tensile stress direction. Meanwhile, relatively flat/thin Ni/Ti/Al-rich oxide complexes also form at other grain boundaries, but they appear to be much less detrimental in fatigue crack initiation and propagation compared with the bulged GB Co-rich oxide complexes.

TI Oxidation behavior of a Single-crystal Ni-base superalloy in air. I: At
   800 and 900 degrees C
SO OXIDATION OF METALS
AB The oxidation behavior of a Single-crystal Ni-base superalloy was studied using discontinuous thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and prolonged exposure in air at 800 and 900degreesC. The mass gain of specimens at 900degreesC was found to be lower than that of specimens at 800degreesC because of the formation of a protective inner alpha-Al2O3 layer at 900degreesC. A subparabolic time dependence ( n = 0.16 at 800degreesC and n = 0.10 at 900degreesC) of the oxide growth rate was determined at both temperatures. At 800degreesC, the superalloy exhibited non-uniform oxidation-in some areas a thin scale with an outer NiO layer and an inner layer of an Al-rich oxide was found and, in other areas, complex oxides [CrTaO4, NiCr2O4, (Ni, Co) Al2O4, etc.] below the NiO outer layer formed by growing into the superalloy. The scale formed at 900degreesC is more uniform than that formed at 800degreesC, consisting of several layers: an NiO outer layer, spinel-rich sublayer, a CrTaO4-rich layer, and an alpha-Al2O3 inner layer. The alpha-Al2O3 inner layer provides good oxidation protection and the specimen mass gain is low for test up to 1925 hr.

TI High temperature oxidation of gamma/gamma '-strengthened Co-base

SO CORROSION SCIENCE
AB Isothermal oxidation was carried out on new gamma/gamma ' Co-base superalloys of the system Co-Al-W-B. Appropriate B-contents lead to improved oxidation resistance and oxide layer adhesion. Oxidation at 800 and 900 degrees C results in formation of Co3O4, CoO, and complex oxides (containing Co, Al, and W). A continuous and protective inner alumina layer forms only at 800 degrees C. Furthermore, oxidation leads to phase transformation (gamma/gamma ' to gamma/Co3W microstructure) at the matrix/oxide layer interface due to Al-depletion. The effect of additional alloying elements such as Ta, Cr, Nb, Si, V. Mo, and It on the oxidation behaviour was also investigated. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

SO SCRIPTA MATERIALIA
AB We present the first report of a tungsten-free cobalt-based superalloy having a composition Co-10Al-5Mo-2Nb. The alloy is strengthened by cuboidal precipitates of metastable Co-3(Al,Mo,Nb) distributed throughout the microstructure. The precipitates are coherent with the face-centred cubic gamma-Co matrix and possess ordered Ll(2) structure. The microstructure is identical to the popular gamma-gamma' type nickel-based superalloys and that of recently reported Co-Al-W-based alloys. Being tungsten free, the reported alloy has higher specific proof stress compared to existing cobalt-based superalloys. (C) 2014 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Microstructural Characterization and Cyclic Hot Corrosion Behaviour of
   Sputtered Co-Al Nanostructured Coatings on Superalloy
SO OXIDATION OF METALS
AB Nanostructured Co-Al coatings on Superni-718 superalloy substrate were deposited by DC/RF magnetron sputtering in the present work. The microstructure and cyclic hot-corrosion behavior of nanostructured Co-Al coatings on Superni-718 superalloy were investigated in molten salt of 40 wt% Na(2)SO(4) + 60 wt% V(2)O(5) at 900 A degrees C. The results showed that a dense scale formed on the coated samples exposed to corrosive environment during thermal cycling. The spinel phases of CoCr(2)O(4), CoAl(2)O(4) and NiCr(2)O(4) were found in the corroded scale of the coatings, resulting in an effective inhibition of O and S diffusion. The sputtered Co-Al coatings exhibited high hot corrosion resistance due to the formation of beta-CoAl phases in the coating. The relevant corrosion mechanisms substantiating the role of coatings are discussed.

SO CORROSION SCIENCE
AB A microstructural investigation of Type-II hot corrosion was carried out on a single crystal Ni-based superalloy (CMSX-4) pre-coated with Na2SO4 at 700 degrees C in a flowing O-2-SO2-SO3 atmosphere. Corrosion occurred by rapid dissolution of the alloy by molten sulfate eutectics, forming an outer layer rich in Co and Ni and an inner layer rich in Cr and Al. The outer layer transformed into mixed oxides of Co and Ni, with concurrent evolution of the continuous S-rich inner layer. A multicomponent analysis provides insight into diffusional interactions among Co, Ni, and S. Crystal orientation and microstructure effects were also studied. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The scales formed after SO(2)-gas corrosion tests were generally adherent at 800 and 900 degrees C. At 1000 degrees C, massive scale spallation however occurred over the entire surface. The scales consisted of Cr(2)O(3), (Ni,Co)Cr(2)O(4), and TiO(2), indicating that not sulfidation but an oxidation reaction prevailed owing to the thermodynamic stability of concerning oxides.

TI Interfacial reactions of a MAX phase/superalloy hybrid
SO SURFACE AND INTERFACE ANALYSIS
AB Oxidation resistant, strain tolerant MAX phase coatings are of general interest for high temperature applications. Accordingly, Cr2AlC MAX phase coupons were vacuum diffusion bonded to an advanced turbine disk alloy at 1100 degrees C for compatibility studies. The interface revealed an inner diffusion zone consisting of similar to 10 mu m of -Ni(Co)Al, decorated with various (Ni,Co)(3)Al, Ta(Ti,Nb)C, and W(Cr,Mo)(3)B-2 precipitates. On the Cr2AlC side, an additional similar to 40-mu m Al-depletion zone of Cr7C3 formed an interconnected network with the -Ni(Co)Al. On the superalloy side, enhanced carbide precipitation developed over a depth of similar to 80 mu m. Subsequent annealing for 100h and 1000h at 800 degrees C coarsened some features, enhanced TCP precipitation in the superalloy, but only enlarged the diffusion layers by similar to 5 mu m at most. Because of Al depletion from the MAX phase and corresponding Al enrichment of the alloy, the reaction zone displayed similarities to an oxidized Cr2AlC surface and an aluminized superalloy, respectively.

TI Type II Hot Corrosion Screening Tests of a Cr2AlC MAX Phase Compound
SO OXIDATION OF METALS
AB Low-temperature hot corrosion tests were performed on bulk Cr2AlC MAX phase compounds for the first time. This material is a known alumina-former with good oxidation and Type I high-temperature hot corrosion resistance. Unlike traditional (Ni,Co)CrAl alumina formers, it contains no Ni or Co that may react with Na2SO4 salt deposits needed to form corrosive mixed (Ni,Co)SO4-Na2SO4 eutectic salts active in Type II hot corrosion. Cr2AlC samples coated with 20K(2)SO(4)-80Na(2)SO(4) salt were exposed to 300ppm SO2 at 700 degrees C for times up to 500h. Weight change, recession, and cross-sectional microstructures identified some reactivity, but much reduced (<1/10) compared to a Ni(Co) superalloy baseline material. Layered Al2O3/Cr2O3 scales were indicated, either separated by or intermixed with some retained salt. However, there was no conclusive indication of salt melting. Accelerated oxidation was proposed to explain the results, and coarse Cr7C3 impurities appeared to play a negative role. In contrast, the superalloy exhibited outer Ni(Co) oxide and inner Cr2O3 scales, with Cr-S layers at the interfaces. Massive spallation of the corrosion layers occurred repeatedly for the superalloy, but not at all for Cr2AlC. This indicates some potential for Cr2AlC as LTHC-resistant coatings for superalloys.

TI Microstructural evolution of CoCrAlY bond coat on Ni-based superalloy DZ
   125 at 1050 degrees C
SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB CoCrAlY alloy has been widely used as metallic protective coatings or the bond coats in thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) to protect the underlying superalloy from oxidation and hot-corrosion. In this paper, the TBC consisting of yttria stabilized zirconia (7YSZ) ceramic top coat and CoCrAlY bond coat was deposited onto directionally solidified nickel based superalloy DZ 125 by electron beam physical vapor deposition (EB-PVD). The microstructural evolution of the bond coat on this superalloy was investigated after thermal exposure for 100 h at 1050 C. Due to a significant inward diffusion of Al, Co and Cr from the coating and outward diffusion of Ni, Hf,W and Ti from the substrate, the phase transformation from the Co-based Al-rich beta-CoAl phase to the Al-deficient gamma-CoNi solid solution phase occurred in the bond coat. Simultaneously, a large amount of Ni-based beta-NiCoAl phase was present in the bond coat. In addition, the particles containing substrate strengthening elements Hf and/or W are abundant in the thermally grown oxides (TGO) and within the bond coat. The mechanism for the microstructural evolution is discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Microstructure and cyclic oxidation behaviour of low-Pt/Dy co-doped
   beta-NiAl coatings on single crystal (SC) superalloy
SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB The low-Pt/0.1 at.% Dy co-doped beta-NiAlCrSi coating was produced on single crystal (SC) superalloy IC21 by electro-plating of a similar to 3 mu m thick Pt film followed by electron beam physical vapour deposition (EB-PVD) of a beta-NiAlDyCrSi over layer. For comparison, the single low-Pt doped and single Dy-doped beta-NiAlCrSi coatings were also prepared, respectively. The cyclic oxidation behaviour of the above coatings at 1200 degrees C was investigated. Minor Dy-doping led to refinement of grains of the as-deposited coating. The addition of Pt effectively suppressed precipitation of topologically close-packed phase (TCP) in the interdiffusion zone (IDZ) during heat-treatment. The coupled effects of Pt/Dy co-doping led to lower oxidation rate, less scale rumpling and improved scale adherence than the single-doping cases and the related mechanisms were discussed.

AB The oxidation behaviour of model Co-Re based alloys at 1000 degrees C in air has been investigated. Thermogravimetric studies in combination with microstructural examinations of Co-Re alloys with different compositions showed the negative influence on the oxidation resistance of Co based alloys due to the evaporation of rhenium oxide(s). Oxidation at 1000 degrees C in air yielded an oxide scale, which consists of a Co oxide outer layer on a thick and porous mixed Co-Cr oxide and a semicontinuous and therefore non-protective Cr oxide film on the base metal substrate. This allows the vaporisation of rhenium oxide formed during oxidation and leads to a loss of Re. In addition, computer aided thermodynamic calculations were carried out to supplement the experimental analyses.

CL Noordwijk, NETHERLANDS
AB The effects of platinum (Pt) layer on phase transformation and oxidation behavior of MCrAlY (M = Co, Ni) coatings were investigated by isothermal and cyclic oxidation tests at temperature of 1100 degrees C. Pt layer of about 5 mu m thickness was deposited on MAR M247-DS superalloy byan electroplating method, and then the MCrAlY layers were coated with air plasma spray (APS) and vacuum plasma spray (VPS) methods. APS process creates internal oxides and interface voids, whereas the VPS process shows fewer voids in the interface between the MCrAlY layer and the superalloy used as substrate. The oxides and voids formed in the APS process deteriorate the oxidation resistance, indicating that the oxides and voids are transferred to Al2O3 compounds during the oxidation tests. The Pt layer shows a strong affinity with Ni element and a weak affinity with Co and Cr elements, resulting in the formation of beta-(Ni,Pt)Al phase. The Pt pre-coated layer forces down for the diffusion of soluble elements to get the reduced deplete zone in the superalloy. The VPS process enhances the oxidation resistance of the MCrAlY coating and shows better bonding strength, owing to the generation of homogenous microstructure in the coating and less processing defects.

AB The isothermal and cyclic oxidation behaviour of two Co modified aluminide coatings together with the simple aluminide coating were performed at 1000 degrees C and 1100 degrees C. All the three coatings show a much lower oxidation rate compared with the bare alloy. Results also indicate the addition of Co to the aluminide coating decreases the oxidation resistance slightly. It can be ascribed to that Co is easier to be oxidized than Ni at high temperature, and the Cr(W) rich phases which could act as a diffusion barrier are less in the coating with higher Co content.

SO CORROSION SCIENCE
AB High temperature oxidation behaviours of gamma'-strengthened Co-based superalloys with various Ni additions were investigated at both 800 degrees C and 900 degrees C. The results show that the superalloys show excellent oxidation resistance due to the formation of compact spinel oxide scales. With the increasing of Ni addition, the concentration of Cr in scale/alloy interface will be increased but that of Co will be decreased. And the growth of Cr2O3 will be promoted, while CoO nucleation will be hindered. Therefore, increasing Ni addition helps the formation of protective spinel oxide scales and delays nodular oxidation, which favours to be better oxidation resistance.

SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Low cycle fatigue (LCF) performance of a novel high Co nickel-base polycrystalline superalloy was investigated at 750 degrees C under the strain ranges from 0.6 to 1.0%. The objective is to focus on fatigue life, cyclic deformation behavior, deformation substructure, fracture mode, crack propagation pathway as well as oxidation attack at the crack tip. The fatigue life decreases with strain range increasing and follow the Coffin-Manson power law with plastic strain. The experimental results show that a transformation from intergranular to transgranular failure was detected using microscopic observation. Post-mortem examination shows that the crack prefers propagating along random high angle boundaries comparing to twin boundaries. It has been evidenced that oxidation damage accumulation at the crack tip can promote intergranular crack propagation. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The isothermal oxidation behavior of a NiCrAlY coating prepared by means of electrospark deposition (ESD) technology on second-generation Ni-based single-crystal DD6 was investigated at 1100 degrees C for 100 h. Surface morphologies, chemical composition, and the phase constitution of the coating were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive spectrometer (EDS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The results showed that the as-deposited NiCrAlY coating, with uniform superfine columnar crystals and nanocrystallines. consists of beta-NiAl and gamma-Ni double phases; the oxidation resistance of the DD6 alloy was greatly improved by depositing the NiCrAlY coating, which was covered by two layers of oxides, theta-Al2O3 and alpha-Al2O3, while three layers of oxides, including Ni(Co)O, NiCr2O4, CrTaO4, CoTa2O6 and alpha-Al2O3, formed on the DD6 superalloy; the interdiffusion zone (IDZ) and secondary reaction zone (SRZ) formed between the NiCrAlY coating and the DD6 superalloy substrate for the interdiffusion; however, no deleterious Kirkendall voids appeared, which may be mainly due to the gradient transition of the elements between the coating and the substrate.

The microstructural features of the as deposited coatings were characterized by FE-SEM, AFM and XRD. It was observed that the corrosion rate of Cr/Co-Al coated superalloy is lower than that of the uncoated superalloy due to the formation of continuous. dense, adherent and protective oxide scale over the surface of the coatings. The protective oxide scales are basically the thin layer of Cr2O3, Al2O3, and CoCr2O4 which has formed over the Cr/Co-Al coated superalloy substrate exposed to molten salt environment at temperature, 900 degrees C.

TI On the oxidation of the third-generation single-crystal superalloy
   CMSX-10
SO METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND
   MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB The oxidation behavior of the third-generation nickel-base single-crystal superalloy CMSX-10 is examined. Since the in-service performance of the alloy is of the greatest practical significance, a detailed study is made of the microstructural degradation of a turbine blade that had been removed prematurely from a commercial gas turbine engine. The results are augmented with isothermal oxidation tests conducted in the laboratory for 100 hours, at temperatures of 800 degrees C, 900 degrees C, and 1000 degrees C. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis, microhardness testing, and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were employed. It was found that the oxidation of CMSX-10 at temperatures below 1000 degrees C does not produce either Al2O3 or the spinel Ni(Cr,Al)(2)O-4, both of which are found in the internal oxidation zone of the earlier generations of superalloys. Surprisingly, it is demonstrated conclusively that the oxidation of CMSX-10 generates the beta phase (NiAl). This reaction, which to the authors' knowledge has not yet been reported, is termed self-aluminization. The XRD studies demonstrate that the internal oxidation of CMSX-10 produces (Ni,Co)Ta2O6, (Ni,CO)WO4, CrTaO4, and Cr(W,MO)O-4. There is indication that the formation of the delta phase (Ni2Al3) slows the oxidation rate at 1000 degrees C.

AB Particle surface component and valence state of nickel-based superalloy FGH96 powders fabricated by argon gas atomization have been measured by X-ray phoelectron spectrometer (XPS) to recognize the effect of powder size, surface segregation and heat treating on the oxidation behavior of powders. Type and phase structure of prior particle boundaries (PPBs) precipitated in HIPed superalloy have been studied also. The results showed that prior particle surface segregation and oxidation happened during the powder collection and storage with the C, O, Ti elements enrichment and Ti, Cr, Al, Zr elements oxidation in the surface respectively. During the heat treating of 1150 degrees C/2h, normal segregation element Ti and Zr enriched more apparently in the particle surface, on the contrary, negative segregation elements Ni, Al and Co diffused into the particle inner. Furthermore, the higher oxygen level on particle surface enhanced to form much more oxides such as ZrO2, TiO2 and Cr2O3. During HIP process of 1150 degrees C/2h/150MPa, the oxide ZrO2 as the nuclei accelerated the preferential precipitation of MC-type carbides which forms the continuous harmful PPBs. Definitely, PPB precipitation depended on the prior particle surface segregation and oxidation, surface elements Ti, Cr and Nb enrichment and oxidation reaction enhancement in high temperature such as 1150 degrees C. Small powders always had little segregation in the surface and thin oxidation layer, but had more oxygen content per weight for its higher specific surface. So using some powders with optimum particle size and lower oxygen content can help to reduce the PPB precipitation.

AB The isothermal oxidation behaviour of a series of quinary Ni-Co-Al-Ti-Cr alloys were studied at 800 A degrees C. Alloys with higher Cr concentrations exhibited lower mass gain after 100-h exposure, as did the alloys richest in Ni and Al for a given Cr concentration. Extensive internal oxidation and nitridation was also observed in all alloys, except those containing the highest concentrations of Ni and Al. All alloys studied generated continuous chromium oxide layers, beneath which alumina particles were observed. Compositional analysis of the subscales identified shallower Cr concentration gradients in alloys containing equiatomic levels of Ni and Co, suggesting increased availability of Cr in the alloy. Thermodynamic calculations confirmed that these alloys contained higher concentrations of Cr in their gamma matrices as a result of a combination of both the elemental partitioning behaviour and the increased mole fraction of gamma' precipitates forming in the alloy.

TI Oxidation of a Zr-doped NiAl bondcoat thermochemically deposited on a

SO MATERIALS AT HIGH TEMPERATURES
AB Thermal barrier systems are used to protect aeronautical turbine blades from heat and oxidation. Three component parts are involved: a nickel-based superalloy, an intermetallic bondcoat that forms a protective alumina scale and a zirconia topcoat that acts as the thermal barrier. The present work focuses on the oxidation behaviour of a NiAl bondcoat doped with a reactive element. The Studied system includes an AMI superalloy coated with a NiAl(Zr) layer innovatively obtained by thermochemical co-deposition of Al and Zr in the vapour phase. Cyclic and isothermal oxidation tests were performed and the long-term oxidised samples were characterised by scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy and time of flight-second ion mass spectrometry analyses were conducted after very short-time oxidation tests. The results show that adding Zr to the coating is beneficial to the oxidation resistance and to the oxide scale adhesion. Major segregation of Zr is obtained in the initial stages of oxide growth.

ToF-SIMS investigations show that boron accumulates in the inner oxide layer which improves the oxidation behaviour and oxide layer adhesion considerably. B-rich precipitations can be observed in the alloy matrix, as well. Appropriate amounts of chromium as additional alloying element lead to further improvement of the oxidation resistance due to the formation of protective inner Al(2)O(3) and Cr(2)O(3) scales.

SO OCHRONA PRZED KOROZJA
AB Characterization of oxidation resistance of new type of cobalt based superalloys were presented in this investigations. As a referential material the Co-10Al-5Mo-2Nb (at.%) was used as the tungsten-free version of basic Co-7Al-7W alloy. The investigated alloy was modified by addition of yttrium on the level of 0.5 at.% due to expectation of improvement of it oxidation resistance. Both Co-based superalloys were casted in Institute of Materials Engineering of Silesian University of Technology in Poland. The oxidation performance of alloys were made during thermogravimetric investigations at temperature range from 25 to 1200 degrees C. The main analyzed parameter was mass gain detected continuously during the test. After the test the overall and cross-sectional analysis of specimens was made. They included analysis of oxide layer morphology on the surface of specimens with characterization of phase constituent of oxide layer. The detailed analysis of oxidized layer was made by scanning electron microscopy method where distribution of alloying elements was made with special attentions on yttrium localization after the test in oxide zone. Obtained data showed that addition of Y has a strong influence on oxidation performance of new Co based superalloy. Those influence is demonstrated mainly by different morphology of final oxide zone with strong influence on Mo and Nb diffusion.

TI Fatigue crack growth characteristics of a new Ni-Co-base superalloy
   TMW-4M3: effects of temperature and load ratio
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB The fatigue crack growth (FCG) behavior of a newly developed Ni-Co-base superalloy TMW-4M3 has been investigated in this study. Experiment was carried out in laboratory air with compact-tension specimen. The effects of temperature (400, 650, and 725 degrees C) and load ratio (0.05 and 0.5) on crack growth rate were studied in the Paris regime. The results revealed that the crack growth rate increased with increasing temperature under a given load ratio. The influence of load ratio on crack growth rate was pronounced, especially at higher temperature and low stress intensity factor range. Fractographic observations showed that fracture mode was transgranular at 400 degrees C, mixed transgranular and intergranular at 650 degrees C, and predominantly intergranular at 725 degrees C. The possible explanations for the crack growth behavior were discussed based on the degradation of mechanical properties and the oxidation assisted crack growth, as well as the crack closure effect. A comparison of FCG rate was also made between TMW-4M3 and the commercial superalloy U720Li.

SO RARE METALS
AB Hot corrosion behavior of FGH96 powder metallurgy (P/M) superalloy in 25% NaCl+75% Na2SO4 molten salts at 650, 700, and 750 degrees C was investigated in this paper. The methods of mass loss measurement, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) were used here. The experimental results show that hot corrosion kinetics follows a square power law at 650 degrees C, while a linear one at 700 and 750 degrees C. The corrosion layer is detected to be composed of Cr2O3, NiO, and Ni2S3 at each temperature. The cross-sectional morphologies and corresponding elemental maps indicate that the corrosion layer is a stratified structure of oxide and sulfide. The results and analyses confirm that the hot corrosion mechanism of FGH96 P/M superalloy is a cooperate process of oxidation and sulfidation. Furthermore, the relatively higher concentrations of Cr, Co, and Ti provide better corrosion resistance to the attack of S and Cl-.

TI Solidification and Segregation Behaviors with Solidification Rate in Co
   base superalloy, FSX-414
SO JOURNAL OF THE KOREAN INSTITUTE OF METALS AND MATERIALS
AB Co base superalloys have been widely used for the parts of gas turbine due to their excellent strength, thermal fatigue, oxidation resistance and weldability at high temperature. In this study, directional solidifications were carried out at various solidification rates, including 0.5 similar to 300 mu m/s in the Co base superalloy FSX-414. The cellular interface were formed at a low solidification rate, 1 mu m/s, and the dendritic interface was found at higher solidification rates, 5 similar to 300 mu m/s. As the spacing of dendrite structure decreased, the size and spacing of eutectics decreased. Dendrite arm spacing decreased with increasing solidification rates and temperature gradient. It was interesting to find the M23C6 eutectic microstructure formed between gamma dendrites. Composition analysis showed that Cr and W were segregated severely between the dendrites, which resulted in the formation of Cr-rich M23C6 and W-rich MC carbides.

The results show that the coating with 2 wt% Al in the pack has a three-layer structure, while the coatings with 2.5 wt% and 3 wt% Al have two layers. In addition, the main phases in the coatings with 2 wt% and 3 wt% Al are alpha-Cr and NiAl, respectively, while the main phase in the coating with 2.5 wt% Al is NiAl with several Cr-rich particles and solid-solution Cr atoms in the coating. The oxidation test demonstrates that the coated specimen with 2 wt% Al has the poorest oxidation resistance and the coated specimen with 2.5 wt% Al has the best oxidation resistance.

AB Surface Cr oxidation mechanism of Alloy 617 was investigated in He-CO-CO2 environments with P-co/P-co2 of either 9 or 1320 at temperatures 750-850 degrees C. The activation energy for surface oxidation was 169.0 +/- 13.2 kJ/mol in He-P-co/P-co2 = 9 and 234.4 +/- 8.9 kJ/mol in He-P-co/P-co2 = 1320. The ambient oxygen partial pressure dependence of the measured oxidation rates was consistent with n-type behavior of Cr2O3, in which Cr interstitials are the primary mobile species. The oxidation rates measured were greater than that can be sustained only by lattice diffusion of Cr in Cr2O3, indicating that grain boundary diffusion of Cr plays a role in the Cr2O3 growth kinetics.

The pre-oxidation heat-treatment (PHT) at 1200 degrees C for 5 min resulted in the formation of a protective multi-oxide layer. The behavior of pre-treated and non pre-treated samples during isothermal oxidation at 800, 900 and 1000 degrees C in air was studied. Results showed that rate-constants of the oxidation processes of pre-treated samples were significantly lower than those of the non pre-treated ones. Oxidation at 800, 900 and 1000 degrees C in air for 100 h, resulted in the formation of MnCr2O4, Cr2O3 and SiO2 compounds for both kinds of samples. A diffusion-controlled mechanism is proposed to describe the oxidation process. (C) 2016 The Electrochemical Society. All rights reserved.

SO CORROSION SCIENCE
AB Isothermal oxidation was carried out on gamma'-strengthened Co-Al-W-B-Ni and Co-Al-W-B-Si superalloys at 800, 900, and 1000 degrees C. Ni-addition to Co-Al-W-B alloys leads to an absence of B within the inner oxide layer and at the grain boundaries, as indicated by ToF-SIMS. As a result, also inner Al2O3-formation is inhibited, which leads to inferior oxidation properties compared to Ni-free alloys. In contrast, Si-addition enhances formation of protective Al2O3 at 900 and 1000 degrees C due to enhanced selective Al-oxidation. Si-containing phases at the oxide/alloy interface, at the grain boundaries, and within precipitates are of subordinate importance but may further improve oxidation resistance. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Microstructure of palladium and hafnium co-doped aluminide coatings deposited on pure nickel and CMSX4 nickel super alloy by the CVD method was examined by the SEM and TEM methods. Both coatings have a double layer structure: additive and interdiffusion zones. The additive zone is formed by the hafnium doped beta-(Ni,Pd) Al phase. The interdiffusion zone on pure nickel contains the palladium and hafnium doped gamma'-Ni3Al phase, whereas that on CMSX-4 superalloy the hafnium doped beta-(Ni,Pd) Al phase with precipitations of Topologically Closed-Pack phases (mu and sigma) and Al2O3 at adhesive/interdifusion zones interfaces. Palladium is distributed uniformly in whole coatings. Hafnium forms precipitates that are situated in a Hf-rich belt. In both coatings this belt is in the additive layer, near the line of porosity and Al2O3 precipitates. Palladium and hafnium modified aluminide coatings show better oxidation resistance than those modified only with palladium. (C) 2018 Politechnika Wroclawska. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Degradation by high temperature oxidation and hot corrosion is the main failure mode of components in the hot section of gas turbines, boilers, industrial waste incinerators, metallurgical furnaces and petrochemical installations. Corrosive environment is because of the usage of wide range of fuel containing large amount of Cl and S together with the volatile alkali metals such as K and Na which leads to the degradation of material. To obviate this problem, superalloy Superco 605 has been studied in air as well as in molten salt environment at 900 degrees C for 100 cycles. Weight change measurements were taken by a digital electronic weighing balance having accuracy of 1 mg after each cycle (heating at 900 degrees C for 1 hour. and subsequently cooling in air for 20 min.) which was used to determine the kinetics of corrosion. The oxide scales formed on the surface of the superalloy were characterized by various techniques such as FESEM, EDAX and XRD. It was found that superco 605 shows good oxidation resistance in air at 900 degrees C but poor corrosion resistance in simulated incinerator environment.

AB In advanced industrial gas-turbine systems, there has been a great demand for new single crystal (SC) superalloys with an excellent combination of high-temperature creep strength, hot-corrosion resistance and oxidation resistance. In this study, 12 nickel-based SC superalloys were designed with the aid of the d-electrons concept. Their chemical compositions were in the range of 1.2-1.5%Ti, 3.8-6.5%Cr, 11%Co, 0-1.4%Mo, 0-3.0%Ru, 6.5-7.4%Ta, 5.0-6.4%W, 3.6-5.4%Re, 5.1-5.5%Al, 0.12-0.14%Hf and balanced Ni in wt%. A series of experiments such as creep rapture tests, burner rig tests and cyclic oxidation,tests were conducted with the heat-treated SC specimens of these alloys. Almost all the designed alloys were found to be superior in creep rupture life to a second generation superalloy currently used in the world. For hot-corrosion resistance, estimated from the burner rig tests, any of the designed alloys were comparable or even superior to a second generation superalloy. The. oxidation resistance was very different among the designed alloys, but some of them showed better resistance than the second generation superalloy. Thus the SC alloys containing about 4-5 wt%Re had about 30 degrees C or more higher temperature capability than the second generation superalloy, while exhibiting excellent hot-corrosion resistance and good oxidation resistance.

TI A New Polycrystalline Co-Ni Superalloy
SO JOM
AB In 2006, a new-ordered L1(2) phase, Co-3(Al,W), was discovered that can form coherently in a face-centered cubic (fcc) A1 Co matrix. Since then, a community has developed that is attempting to take these alloys forward into practical applications in gas turbines. A new candidate polycrystalline Co-Ni gamma/gamma' superalloy, V208C, is presented that has the nominal composition 36Co-35Ni-15Cr-10Al-3W-1Ta (at.%). The alloy was produced by conventional powder metallurgy superalloy methods. After forging, a gamma' fraction of similar to 56% and a secondary gamma' size of 88 nm were obtained, with a grain size of 2.5 mu m. The solvus temperature was 1000 degrees C. The density was found to be 8.52 g cm(-3), which is similar to existing Ni alloys with this level of gamma'. The alloy showed the flow stress anomaly and a yield strength of 920 MPa at room temperature and 820 MPa at 800 degrees C, similar to that of Mar-M247. These values are significantly higher than those found for either conventional solution and carbide-strengthened Co alloys or the gamma/gamma' Co superalloys presented in the literature thus far. The oxidation resistance, with a mass gain of 0.08 mg cm(-2) in 100 h at 800 degrees C, is also comparable with that of existing high-temperature Ni superalloys. These results suggest that Co-based and Co-Ni superalloys may hold some promise for the future in gas turbine applications.

TI Cyclic oxidation and interdiffusion behavior of Pt modified NiAlHfCrSi
   coatings on single crystal superalloy containing Mo
SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB beta-NiAlHfCrSi coatings were deposited on a Mo-containing single crystal (SC) superalloy with or without an electro-plated Pt film by electron beam physical vapor deposition (EB-PVD), respectively. Co-doping of Cr and Si caused grain refinement of the coatings and retarded outward diffusion of Pt during heat-treatment in vacuum at 1050 degrees C. During cyclic oxidation at 1150 degrees C, severe scale spallation occurred in the Pt-free coating due to the formation of voids beneath the oxide scale. The Pt modified coating effectively suppressed the formation and growth of voids and exhibited improved cyclic-oxidation resistance. Si-doping not only reduced the oxidation rate of the coating but also enhanced the oxide scale adherence, one of mechanisms for which is that the addition of Si in the coating prevented outward diffusion of refractory elements such as Mo from the alloy substrate.

AB Ni-based superalloy is widely used for high performance components in power generation turbine due to its excellent mechanical properties. However, Ni-based superalloy has low oxidation resistantance. Therefore, surface coating is required to improve oxidation resistance at high temperatures. Al-Si as a coting material was successfully co-deposited on Nibased substrate by pack cementation method at 900 degrees C for about 4 hours. The oxidation test was carried out at high temperature of 1000 degrees C for 100 hours. Micro structural characterization and analysis on crystal orientation were perfomed by using Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FE-SEM) and Electron Back Scatter Diffraction (EBSD) technique, respectively. The results showed that the coating layer with a homogenous layer and had a thickness of 53 mu m consisting of beta-NiAl with cubic structure and Ni2Al3 with hexagonal structure. TGO layer was developed after oxidation and had a thickness of about 5 mu m consisting of alpha-Al2O3 and spinel NiCr2O4. The phase composition map and crystal orientation acquired by EBSD technique was also discussed both in TGO and coating layers.

TI Kinetics and Microstructural Investigation of High-Temperature Oxidation
   of IN-738LC Super Alloy
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING AND PERFORMANCE
AB The present study was carried out to investigate the kinetics and the surface chemistry of the oxide layers formed on the IN-738LC super alloy during high-temperature oxidation at 950 A degrees C in air from 1 to 260 h. Oxidation kinetics were studied by mass gain measurement. The oxide layers were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscope, elemental distribution map, energy-dispersive spectroscopy as well as x-ray diffractometry (XRD). The oxidation kinetics followed the parabolic law. The XRD analysis revealed that the oxide scale contained mainly NiO, Ni (Cr, Al)(2)O-4, Al2O3, TiO2 and Cr2O3. The oxide structure, from the top surface down to the substrate, was clarified by elemental map distribution studies as Ni-Ti oxides, Cr-Ti oxides, Cr2O3 oxide band, Ni-Co-Cr-W oxide and finally a blocky Al2O3 region. The oxidation scales were composed of three distinct layers of the outer and mid layers enriched by TiO2 and Cr2O3, NiCr2O4 oxide, respectively, and the innermost layer was composed of Al2O3 and matrix alloy. The depleted gamma prime layer was formed under the oxidation scales due to the impoverishment of Al and Ti which were induced by the formation of Al2O3 and TiO2.

TI Long-term oxidation behavior and mechanism of DD6 Ni-based single
   crystal superalloy at 1050 degrees C and 1100 degrees C in air
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB By virtue of XRD, OM, SEM and EDS, detailed oxidation behaviors for 2000h exposure of DD6 Ni-based single crystal superalloy ware investigated at 1050 degrees C and 1100 degrees C. The oxidation kinetic curves both follow the parabolic law in the first stage, during which time the oxidation behaviors in interdendritic area and dendrite core area are different. With the oxidation time continuing, the morphologies of the oxides in these two kinds of areas gradually tend to coincide: An outer columnar (Ni, Co)O, an intermediate layer mainly composed of NiTa2O6, CoCo2O4, CoWO4, NiCr2O4 and other complex compounds and spinel phases, an inner continuous layer of alpha-Al2O3. The double diffusion of oxygen anions and Ni and Co cations developed inwards and outwards respectively is responsible for the morphology of the oxide scale. At 1100 degrees C, the Al2O3 film formed in the initial time is unstable, discontinuous and incompact and the inner Al2O3 layer formed after 300 h oxidation is porous. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI Isothermal aging of a gamma '-strengthened Co-Al-W alloy coated with
   vacuum plasma-sprayed MCrAlY bond coats
SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB Cobalt-based superalloys with a gamma/gamma' microstructure were discovered in 2006 and are currently being investigated as an alternative to nickel-based superalloys for high-temperature, high-load applications in gas turbine blades. They promise a better castability combined with a similar creep strength. Superalloy turbine blades are commonly coated with oxidation resistant bond coats. For this reason their compatibility needs to be studied. Co-9Al-9W specimens with a gamma/gamma' microstructure were coated with either a nickel-based or cobalt-based MCrAlY bond coat using vacuum plasma spraying. After aging at 900 degrees C in air for up to 500 h no decomposition of the gamma' phase was found in the bulk superalloy. The interdiffusion zone shows several different W-rich topologically close-packed phases arising from the dissolution of the gamma' phase in this region. The W-rich phases are identified to be mu phase for both bond coats and R phase for the nickel-based bond coat only. Their total volume is higher for the nickel-based bond coat. Therefore the cobalt-based bond coat is better suited for the Co-based superalloy substrate. Room temperature hardness and Young's modulus were measured using nanoindentation in the initial state and after heat treatment. A significantly higher Young's modulus was found for the cobalt-based bond coat (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI On oxidation behaviour of platinum aluminide coated nickel based
   superalloy CMSX-(4)
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The effects of platinum modification on the isothermal oxidation performance of a chemical vapour deposition aluminide coating are examined. Platinum was electrodeposited to varying thicknesses (to a maximum of 16 mu m) onto the CMSX-4 single crystal superalloy, before applying a high temperature/low activity aluminisation process. The oxidation performance at 1100 degrees C improved monotonically with increasing Pt thickness; this was confirmed by thermal gravimetric analysis. The degree of rumpling of the alumina scale was also decreased with increasing platinum. The superior oxidation resistance of platinum modified aluminide coatings is a consequence of the beta-NiAl formed during aluminisation containing an enhanced Al/Ni ratio, reduced levels of Co and Ti and decreased concentrations of the refractory elements Re, W and Ta. This seems to be due at least in part to the microstructural effects caused by the prior diffusion of platinum into the surface, which causes the generation of a gamma-(Ni,Pt)/gamma'-(Ni,Pt)(3)Al microstructure; the upper portion of the Pt diffused coating comprises predominantly the gamma'-(Ni,Pt)(3)Al phase which is rich in Pt and Al and depleted in Co and the refractory elements W and Re. The ramifications of our findings for the design of bond coats required for thermal barrier coating systems are discussed.

TI The grain boundary pinning effect of the mu phase in an advanced
   polycrystalline gamma/gamma' Co-base superalloy
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB A grain boundary pinning phase was introduced into a gamma/gamma' Co-base superalloy by the addition of Mo. The intermetallic phase was identified as mu phase (Co,Ni,Cr)(7)(W,Mo)6 by high-energy X-ray diffraction and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy in the transmission electron microscope. Synchrotron radiation insitu heating experiments confirmed the stability of the grain structure up to 1050 degrees C and therefore the grain boundary pinning effect of this phase. Recrystallization heat treatments at different temperatures resulted in varying amounts of mu phase. The grain size analysis revealed that at least 1% of the phase is necessary to maintain a pinning effect during recrystallization. Atom probe tomography confirmed that Mo partitioned predominantly to the gamma phase. Since the mu phase and the gamma' phase are competing for W, a lower gamma volume fraction was formed in comparison to a Mo-free polycrystalline gamma/gamma' Co-base superalloy variant. However, the homogeneous distribution of small grains resulted in a higher strength compared to the Mo-free alloy without grain boundary pinning phases. The creep resistance at 750 degrees C was similar to the Mo-free alloy as well as the polycrystalline Ni-base superalloy U720Li with a creep rate minimum of 1.5 x 10(-7) s(-1) at 620 MPa.

TI Isothermal oxidation behavior of single-crystal Ni-base superalloy
   containing rhenium in air
SO RARE METAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING
AB The high temperature oxidation behavior of the single-crystal Ni-base superalloy DD32 containing rhenium was investigated at 900 degrees C and 1000 degrees C in air by using SEM, XRD, and SEM/EDAX. It is found that there are two oxidation stages in the oxidation kinetics curves at 900 degrees C and 1000 degrees C. In the initial stage, the mass gain rapidly increases and basically obeys a parabola law due to the formation and growth of NiO. In the second oxidation stage, it obeys the asymptotic level linear law with the oxidation time increasing to a critical time when the mass gain goes to be slow, and the Kp value corresponds to the formation and growth of Al2O3. There are three layers for the oxidation film at 900 degrees C and 1000 degrees C: an outer layer of columnar (Ni,Co)O, an intermediate layer mainly composed of complex oxides and a small amount of spinels, and a continuous inner layer of alpha-Al2O3. The phase rich in Re and W precipitates may play a role of "diffusion barrier", which is distributed in the intermediate layer during oxidation, effectively decreases the diffusion rate of Al element in the substrate outward. As a result, a continuous oxide layer of Al2O3 is formed in the inner layer to restrain the growth of oxide film and decrease the oxidation rate.

SO SCRIPTA MATERIALIA
AB The mechanical properties of gamma'-strengthened Co-Ni-Al-W-Cr model superalloys extending from pure Ni-base to pure Co-base superalloys have been assessed. Differential scanning calorimetry measurements and thermodynamic calculations match well and show that the gamma' solvus temperature decreases with increasing Co-content The gamma/gamma' lattice misfit is negative on the Ni- and positive on the Co-rich side. High Ni-contents decelerate the oxidation kinetics up to a factor of 15. The creep strength of the Ni-base alloy increases by an order of magnitude with additions of Co before it deteriorates strongly upon higher additions despite an increasing gamma' volume fraction.

TI Cyclic Oxidation Behavior of an EB-PVD CoCrAlY Coating Influenced by
   Substrate/coating Interdiffusion
SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF AERONAUTICS
AB To reveal the influence of substrate/coating interdiffusion on the cyclic oxidation property of a metallic coating, cyclic oxidation behavior of an EB-PVD CoCrAlY coating on directionally solidified Ni-based superalloy DZ125 at 1 050 degrees C is investigated. The 40 mu m thick CoCrAlY coating has a cyclic oxidation life of around 160 h, and the oxidation constant is 1.915x10(-7) mg(4).cm(-8).s(-1). However, severe spallation of the oxides containing Co, Cr, Ni, Ta and Ti occurs with longer cyclic oxidation. The degradation in oxidation resistance for the coating is related to the depletion of Al due to the oxide spallation and interdiffusion. Severe interdiffusion between the coating and underlying substrate occurs at 1 050 degrees C. The composition of the substrate has an important effect on the thermal cycling lifetime of the coating. The influencing mechanism is discussed.

TI Fundamental investigation of the degradation laws of aluminide coatings
   during high-temperature oxidation
SO MATERIALS AND CORROSION-WERKSTOFFE UND KORROSION
AB During high-temperature oxidation, the aluminide coating degrades by two mechanisms, one is the oxidation of the outer surface, and the other is A1 diffusion into the substrate. The relevant laws are investigated for coatings on Co-base superalloys oxidised in air at high temperatures. The driving force mainly comes from the oxidation reaction for the outer degradation layer, and the chemical potential for the inner degradation layer. By an approximation approach, it can be concluded that the life of the outward-diffusion coating is roughly directly proportional to the second power of the main-phase thickness of the coating.

TI Effect of rare earth element on the oxidation behavior of novel

SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS RESEARCH
AB A series of oxidation experiments were carried out on these novel gamma/gamma'- strengthened cobalt-based alloys of the systems Co-9Al-10W and Co-9Al-10W-0.02X (X = La, Ce, Dy, Y) at 900 degrees C. The appropriate amounts' addition of rare earth elements leads to improved oxidation properties at 900 degrees C, especially La elements show the best oxidation resistance (129.008 mg/cm(2)). However, the base Co-9Al-10W alloy shows the worst oxidation performance (151.544 mg/cm(2)). Multilayer oxide layers formed during the oxidation process, the outer were mainly CoO and Co3O4 oxides, and the middle layer contained complex oxides (containing Co, Al, and W). The inner layer consists of little discontinuous oxides, included few Al2O3 oxides. There existed a different crack width and the base alloy had the widest crack. Moreover, there exists a phase transformation (gamma/gamma' to gamma/Co3W) at the interface between oxide film and substrate.

TI Microstructural homogenization and high-temperature cyclic oxidation
   behavior of a Ni-based super alloywith high-Cr content
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB A new Ni-based superalloy with high-Cr content was designed for industrial gas turbines application. The microstructural homogenization and high-temperature cyclic oxidation behavior was investigated systematically. The results showed that the optimum heat treatment condition was 1563 K (1290 degrees C)/4 h + 1573 K (1300 degrees C)/6 h, A. C. (air cooling) + 1393 K (1120 degrees C)/2 h, A. C. + 1143 K (870 degrees C)/24 h, A. C., which can completely dissolve the gamma/gamma' eutectic and the Ni-3(TiTa) phase in the interdendritic region. The cyclic oxidation results showed that a multilayer of continuous and dense oxide-rich regions formed and the kinetic curves followed a parabolic law. The mass gain at 1323 K (1050 degrees C) and 1343 K (1070 degrees C) was 4.02 mg/cm(2) and 4.23 mg/cm(2), respectively. No severe spallation of the oxide-rich region was observed. The outer layer of the oxide-rich region mainly consisted of Cr2O3, TiO2, and (Ni, Co) Cr2O4 spinels, while the layer at the substrate-oxide interface was found to be Al2O3. The results show that this new superalloy has a better cyclic oxidation resistance at 1343 K (1070 degrees C) than the commonly used IN738 and GTD-111 superalloys. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI Solution heat-treatment of Nb-modified MAR-M247 superalloy
SO MATERIALS CHARACTERIZATION
AB MAR-M247 superalloy has excellent mechanical properties and good oxidation resistance at elevated temperatures. Niobium is an element known as gamma' phase hardener in nickel-based superalloys, besides promoting homogeneous distribution of MC carbides. This work is inserted in a project that aims to evaluate the total replacement of tantalum by niobium atoms in MAR-M247 superalloy (10.2 Co, 10.2 W, 8.5Cr, 5.6 Al, 1.6 Nb, 1.4 Hf, 1.1 Ti, 0.7 Mo, 0.15 C, 0.06 Zr, 0.015 13, Ni balance-wt.%). Based on microstructural characterizations (SEM and FEG-SEM, both with EDS) of the as-cast material and heat-treated materials as well as utilizing Thermocalc simulations and experiments of differential thermal analysis (DTA), heat-treatment at 1260 degrees C for 8 h was chosen as an ideal condition for the solution of Nb-modified MAR-M247 superalloy. The hardness of as-cast and ideally solution treated materials was 390 +/- 14 HV and 415 +/- 6 HV, respectively. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

CL PEOPLES R CHINA
AB The low pressure plasma spraying (LPPS) method was used to prepare NiCoCrAlTaY bond coating on a nickel base superalloy with the composition(wt, %) of C 0.13-0.22, Cr 8.50-9.50, Co 9.0-11.0, Mo 2.50-3.50, Al 4.80-5.70, Ti 4.10-4.70, Fe <= 1.0, V 0.60-0.90, and Ni in balance. The thermal corrosion tests, including Isothermal and cycle oxidation, were conducted for the specimens of the base alloy and the alloy with coatings. The experimental results showed that the thermal spraying NiCoCrAlTaY bond coating improved the thermal corrosion resistance of the alloy significantly. It has been found that the base alloy had high weight gain of 68.91 g/m(2) at the test condition of 1100 degrees C for 100 hrs, while the weightl gain of the specimens of the alloy with NiCoCrAlTaY bond coating, was only 0.76 similar to 5.72 g/m(2). And the slight weight loss appeared when the specimen with with NiCoCrAlTaY bond coating was treated for 40 hrs at1100 degrees C The results also showed that the addition of tantalum element in the coating was beneficial for the thermal oxidation resistance. It has been found that after oxidation at 1100 degrees C for 100 hrs, the continued Al2O3 film nuderneath the outside layer mixture oxides of Cr, Ni, Al and Co, was formed on the substrate surface after both the isothermal oxidation and cycling oxidation. The coating has a good combination with the nickel base superalloy substrate. (C) 2011 Published Elsevier Ltd.

TI Improvement of the high temperature oxidation of TaC-strengthened
   Co(Cr)-based cast superalloys by the addition of nickel
SO CORROSION ENGINEERING SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB In this work, nickel is added in substitution to cobalt in the composition of a cast cobalt-based chromium-rich superalloy designed to obtain a double-phased {fcc matrix + TaC} microstructure. Two nickel amounts were tested, 13 and 26 wt-%Ni, for 25 wt-%Cr, 0.4 wt-%C and 6 wt-%Ta, the rest being cobalt. The obtained as-cast microstructures are not different from the starting alloy's one, contrarily to the hardness which became lower. The oxidation tests at 1200 degrees C for 170 h demonstrated a significant improvement of the alloy's behaviour, especially for an addition of 26 wt-%Ni. This seems to be attributed to an easier Cr diffusion towards the oxidation front as suggested by the observed Cr contents in extreme surface as well as by the lower Cr concentration gradients. In addition, the TaC seemed to be morphologically more stable in the presence of nickel in the alloys than in the absence of Ni.

TI Oxidation Behavior of Selected Bond Coats Based on the gamma' plus gamma
   Structure and Their Performance in Thermal Barrier Coatings Deposited on
   a Nickel-Based Superalloy
SO OXIDATION OF METALS
AB Three bond coats based on the gamma'-Ni3Al + gamma-Ni microstructure were developed by diffusing pairs of Pt layers and metallic layers with selected compositions into a Ni-based superalloy. Thermal exposure tests at 1,150 A degrees C with 24-h cycling period to room temperature were used to evaluate the thermal stability and oxidation behavior of the bond coats as well as their performance in thermal barrier coating systems utilizing zirconia-7 wt% yttria as the top coat. It is shown that a bond coat developed by a Pt layer and a layer of Ni-6 wt% Re-0.5 wt% Y alloy outperforms the conventional gamma' + gamma Pt bond coats by more than two folds. Most evidence points out that the proper concentrations of Re and Y in the presence of balanced concentrations of other elements, particularly Al, Ti, Cr and Co can significantly enhance the thermal stability and oxidation resistance of gamma' + gamma Pt bond coats.

TI Hot corrosion of nanostructured Cr/Co-Al coatings
SO SURFACE ENGINEERING
AB Nanostructured Cr/Co-Al coatings on Superni-718 superalloy substrate are deposited by direct current/radio frequency magnetron sputtering. The microstructure and hot corrosion behaviour of sputtered Cr/Co-Al coatings on Superni-718 superalloy have been investigated in molten salt of 40 wt-%Na2SO4+60 wt-%V2O5 at 900 degrees C. The results showed that a dense scale formed on the coated samples during thermal cycling. The spinel phases of CoCr2O4, CoAl2O4 and NaAlO2 are present in the scale of the corroded coating, resulting in an effective inhibition of O and S diffusion. The sputtered coatings showed better performance of hot corrosion due to its possession of beta-CoAl phases (as Al reservoir) in the outer layer of the coating and Cr as an intermediate layer. The relevant corrosion mechanisms are discussed.

TI The oxidation behavior of the new nickel-based superalloy Inconel 740
   with and without Na2SO4 deposit
SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB The new nickel-based superalloy, Inconel 740, with and without Na2SO4 deposit were oxidized in still air between 850 and 1000 degreesC to investigate the oxidation and hot corrosion behavior by means of XRD, SEM and EDS. The kinetic curves of the alloy oxidized at 950 degreesC without Na2SO4 deposit and at 850 degreesC with Na2SO4 deposit obeyed the parabolic law, whereas, the uniform parabolic growth behavior of oxide was not followed at 1000 degreesC without Na2SO4 deposit and at 950 degreesC with Na2SO4 deposit due to oxide spallation at 1000 degreesC and the evaporation of Na2CrO4 melt at 950 degreesC, respectively. The oxide scales consisted of Cr2O3, (Ni,Co)Cr2O4, TiO2, Al2O3 and internal oxides at all temperatures. The internal sulfidation took place due to the existence of Na2SO4 deposit. The complex layered structure of oxide scales was in favor of the resistance to oxidation. The deposition of Na2SO4 accelerated the oxidation of the alloy and the degradation of corrosion resistance of alloy with Na2SO4 deposit was attributed to the dissolution of Cr2O3 induced by basic fluxing in molten Na2SO4.

TI Evolution of microstructure and mechanical properties of coated Co-base
   superalloys during heat treatment and thermal exposure
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB New gamma'-strengthened Co-base superalloys show an interesting potential for high temperature applications. However, protective coatings are needed as for Ni-base superalloys to ensure sufficient oxidation and corrosion resistance. Therefore the properties of a commercial coating on a multinary new gamma'-strengthened Co-base superalloy have been studied. Especially the influence of the coating process on the substrate also after long term annealing is discussed. It was found that the highly deformed areas at the coating-substrate interface indicated by a high local misorientation and caused by the sandblasting process led to a recrystallization of the interdiffusion zone during the age hardening heat treatment. A chemical gradient of gamma and gamma' promoting elements was found in the interdiffusion zone causing a change in hardness as measured by nanoindentation. Depending on the composition two separate recrystallized regions formed in the interdiffusion zone, one with single phase gamma-(Co,Ni) and the other with a cellular two phase microstructure of discontinuously grown gamma and gamma'.

AB To propose reactive element (RE) co-doping strategy, the oxidation behaviour of Dy, Hf, Y, Zr single- and co-doped Ni-30AI alloys was comparatively studied. All the alloys containing Dy or Y exhibited improved scale adhesion due to the pinning effect of the pegs at the scale/alloy interfaces and the reduced residual stress by the flaky oxides formed on the alloy surfaces. Compared to the corresponding RE single-doping, Dy/Hf, Dy/Zr, Hf/Y and Y/Zr co-doping further reduced the scale growth rate, revealing a synergistic effect. The role of reactive element co-segregation in the formation of synergistic effect was analyzed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Its oxide scale consists of Al2O3, NiO and Ta2O5. Chlorination and/or oxidation of Ta ruined compactness of scale. The yttrium modified nanocrystalline coating provides the highest corrosion resistance. Its scale is exclusively alumina. Yttrium inhibits the outward diffusion of Ta.

SO ACS COMBINATORIAL SCIENCE
AB The complete ternary system Ni-Co-Al was fabricated as a thin film materials library by combinatorial magnetron sputtering and was annealed subsequently in several steps in Ar and under atmospheric conditions at 500 degrees C. Ni-Co-Al is the base system for both Ni- and Co-based superalloys. Therefore, the phases occurring in this system and their oxidation behavior is of high interest. The Ni-Co-Al materials library was investigated using high-throughput characterization methods such as optical measurements, resistance screening, automated EDX, automated XRD, and XPS. From the obtained data a thin film phase diagram for the Ni-Co-Al system in its state after annealing at 500 degrees C in air was established. Furthermore, a surface oxide composition map of the full Ni-Co-Al system for oxidation at 500 degrees C was concluded. As a result, it could be shown that at 500 degrees C an amount of 10 at. % Al is necessary for a Ni-Co-Al thin film to produce a protective Al-oxide scale.

High-accuracy thermogravimetric analysis was used to locate changes in the kinetics of scale growth. Compositions of three separated layers within the scale have been elucidated in detail. The results demonstrate the substantial impact of the two-phase microstructure on the initiation of oxidation for the appearance of the scale.

TI High-temperature oxidation behavior of arc ion plated NiCoCrAlYSiB
   coatings on cobalt-based superalloy
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS RESEARCH
AB NiCoCrAlYSiB coatings were deposited on the Co-based superalloy K40 by arc ion plating (AIP). The oxidation behavior of the bare alloy and of the coated specimens was tested in static air for 200 h at 1000 degrees C and 100 h at 1050 degrees C. The results showed that the oxidation rate of the system was greatly reduced by the addition of the NiCoCrAlYSiB coatings. Thin and adherent alpha-Al2O3 scales that formed on the coated specimens protected the substrates from further oxidation attack while non-protective oxide scales, mainly of Cr2O3 and CoCr2O4, appeared on bare K40 alloy. Element profiles on metallographic cross sections indicated that apparent interdiffusion occurred between the coatings and the substrates. The interdiffusion behavior and the resulting microstructure were investigated. As compared to aluminide coatings, NiCoCrAlYSiB coatings have less influence on the substrate microstructure.

AB The high-temperature oxidation of Co-based oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) Co-20Cr-(5, 10) Al-2.4Hf-1.5Y(2)O(3) (wt%) superalloys was investigated at 900 C-omicron and 1000 C-omicron. The 10Al (wt%) superalloys possess better oxidation resistance with the formation of alumina scale than the 5Al (wt%) with a duplex scale of CoCr2O4/Cr2O3 and internal Al2O3. The alumina on the 10Al superalloy is composed of theta- and alpha-alumina at 900 C-omicron but dominated by alpha-alumina at 1000 C-omicron. The lower weight gain of 10Al superalloys at 1000 C-omicron than at 900 C-omicron was associated with different growth mechanisms of the Al2O3 scales. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   to 6)Ta Alloys
SO METALS AND MATERIALS INTERNATIONAL
AB The oxidation behavior of Ni-based superalloys was examined by cyclic oxidation tests at 850 and 1000 degrees C. The present study focused on the investigation of two newly developed and three commercial alloys (GTD-111, IN738LC, and CM247LC). The oxidation resistance of the superalloys were evaluated by the oxidation rate constants and the mass gains. The oxidation scales mainly consisted of outer Cr2O3 and inner Al2O3 layers at both temperatures, as well as oxides of minor elements such as TiO2, NiCr2O4, CrTaO4, HfO2, and TaO. The oxidation resistance of the alloys containing larger amounts of Al, W, and Ta and lower Mo and Ti concentrations was higher than those of the other alloys. The ranking of oxidation resistance for the alloys corresponded to the statistical prediction drawn from a response surface analysis. Furthermore, these alloys contained more Ta oxides, such as CrTaO4 and TaO, suggesting that Ta oxides had an active role in improving the oxidation resistance.

TI Effects of alloyed Mn on oxidation behaviour of a Co-Ni-Cr-Fe alloy
   between 1050 and 1250 degrees C
SO CORROSION SCIENCE
AB The effects of Mn content on the oxidation behaviour of a Co-base superalloy with compositions of Co-29Cr-21Ni-23Fe-2.2Nb-1.6Si-xMn (x=0, 0.5, 1, 2) (Co22 alloy for short, wt.%) have been studied. Isothermal oxidation behaviour was investigated, and it showed kinetics of the Mn-containing samples followed a two-stage parabolic law. In the absence of Mn, scales on Co22 alloys consisted mainly of Cr2O3 and SiO2, and small amounts of Fe-Cr, Ni-Cr spinel nodules formed on the surface. When Mn was added, a triple oxide layer could be observed, consisting of Mn-Cr spinel as outer layer, Cr2O3 as middle layer and SiO2 in the innermost layer. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Precipitation phases in the nickel-based superalloy DZ 125 with
   YSZ/CoCrAlY thermal barrier coating
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Interdiffusion behavior of the thermal barrier coating (TBC) with the CoCrAlY bond coat (BC) and directionally solidified Ni-based superalloy DZ 125 was investigated. Severe inward-diffusion of Al, Co and Cr from the BC to the superalloy and outward diffusion of Ni and refractory elements such as W from the superalloy occur during annealing at 1050 degrees C in air. After 100 h annealing, a similar to 30 mu m thick inter-diffusion zone (IDZ) forms between the BC and superalloy, and a similar to 35 mu m thick secondary reaction zone (SRZ) forms beneath the IDZ. The IDZ mainly consists of beta phase and gamma matrix. Besides, small amount of Ta and Hf containing carbides are also observed in the IDZ. Needle and fine granular topologically close-packed (TCP) phases, characterized as rhombohedral mu phases, are abundant in the SRZ. The formation of SRZ is mainly due to the precipitation of refractory elements such as W and Mo from the gamma matrix and beta phase. The formation mechanism of SRZ and mu-TCP phase is discussed.

TI Identifying heating rate dependent oxidation reactions on a nickel-based
   superalloy using synchrotron diffraction
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB Synchrotron grazing incidence X-ray diffraction has been used to newly reveal the heating rate dependent oxidation reactions that develop on a polycrystalline nickel-based superalloy. A continuous layer of precursor oxide was shown to form during the heating stage. Their approximate growth rates, their effect on local surface compositions of the alloy substrate, and their degree of interface planarity are considered critical in determining subsequent oxidation reactions when held for extended thermal exposures. The precursor oxides were predominantly nickel or cobalt based (NiO/CoO and Co3O4/NiCo2O4). Following the fastest heating rates (40 degrees C min(-1) and above), the stable Cr2O3 phase formed, inhibiting Ni or Co diffusion to the surface. At slower heating rates (10-20 degrees C min(-1)), no evidence of the stable Cr2O3 was found, even after 200 h at elevated thermal exposure, instead continued growth of the precursor oxides was observed. Heating at 5 degrees C min(-1) gave rise to an intriguing zone where sufficient precursor and favourable kinetics enabled the formation of a spinel, NiCr2O4, surface layer. Cross sections observed with electron microscopy confirmed this to be planar and continuous. Heating at the slowest tested 2 degrees C min(-1) contrarily gives a non-protective surface layer comprising an outwardly growing NiO/CoO precursor oxide on top of an inwardly growing mixed oxide. The quantities, interfacial morphologies of oxides of the precursor oxide grown and the possible thermodynamic reactions that lead to their formation are discussed.

AB Nickel based superalloys have good oxidation and creep resistance and hence they can function under high mechanical stress and high temperatures. However, their undesirable tribological behaviour is the major technical barrier to the challenging high-temperature, lubricant-free plasma sintering tool application. In this study, nickel based CM247 superalloy surfaces were co-alloyed using innovative active screen plasma technology with both interstitial element (e. g. N) and substitutional alloying elements (e. g. V and Ag) to provide a synergy effect to enhance its tribological properties. The tribological behaviour of the plasma co-alloyed CM247 superalloy surfaces were fully evaluated using reciprocal and pin-on-disc tribometers at temperatures from room temperature to 600 degrees C. The experimental results demonstrate that the co-alloyed surface with N, Ag and V can effectively lower the friction coefficient, which is expected to help demoulding during lubricant-free plasma sintering.

AB To study the oxidation resistances of tool material (carbide YG6X) and workpiece material (superalloy Inconel625), an oxidation resistance experiment was carried out in a high-temperature furnace. The high-temperature oxidation products were analysed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). A diffusion behaviour experiment was conducted on the elements of YG6X and Inconel625 in a vacuum tube furnace, and the specimens from the experiment were analysed using electron energy disperse spectroscopy (EDS). The analysis (experiment) results show that YG6X oxidised at 973 K, and WO3 sublimated at approximately 1100 K, exhibiting a poor oxidation resistance at high temperature. Inconel625 oxidised and formed a dense Cr2O3 oxide layer on the surface at approximately 1073 K, maintaining a good oxidation resistance until a temperature of 1273 K. The contents of the matrix elements decreased because of the diffusion between YG6X and Inconel625. As the temperature increased from 873 K to 1273 K, the diffusion was significant. The intrinsic element concentration decreased significantly, and the element diffusion depth increased. Following is the order of the diffusion degree of the five elements in YG6X and Inconel625: W > Ni > Cr > C > Co.

AB The Ni-based superalloy, Inconel 738LC, was corroded between 800 and 1000 degrees C for up to 100 h in the Ar/0.2%SO2 gas. The formed scales were susceptible to breakage and spallation, due partly to the incorporation of sulfur. They consisted primarily of Cr2O3, along with some TiO2 and NiO. Preferential oxidation of Cr to Cr2O3 led to the Cr depletion in the Al2O3-rich internal oxidation zone, where Ni, Co, W, and Ta tended to accumulate as corrosion progressed.

SO RARE METAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING
AB The solidification process and the segregation behavior of the elements of GH4282 superalloy were investigated by a combination of differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), microstructure observation and thermodynamic calculation. The solidification sequence and the characteristics of elements segregation were obtained. The results show that the solidification sequence of GH4282 is as follows: gamma matrix, MC carbide and a small amount of boride. The solidus-liquidus temperature range determined by DSC is 1316 similar to 4367 degrees C. The measured solvus temperature of MC carbide is 1338 degrees C. Thermodynamic calculations show that C, B, Ti and Mo segregate to the interdendritic regions, while Al segregates to the dendrite cores. Cr, Fe and Co do not exhibit any significant tendency to segregate to either the interdendritic region or to the dendrite core during the solidification process of GH4282 superalloy. These results about segregation behavior of the elements agree well with the as-cast microstructure observation.

AB The role of refractory metals on the bare oxidation behaviour of a range of compositionally complex single crystal Ni-base superalloys has been investigated using a range of techniques. It has been shown that this series of fourth generation alloys were borderline alumina formers at 1,100 A degrees C, and their cyclic oxidation performance was detrimentally affected by increased levels of Mo and Co. In addition, there was strong evidence that Re, Ru and Mo were lost through the process of cyclic oxidation, which supports the hypothesis that these elemental additions were lost through volatilisation/sublimation, contributing to their poor cyclic oxidation performance.

TI Effect of W Content on Oxidation Resistance of Experimental Third
   Generation Single Crystal Superalloys
SO RARE METAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING
AB The isothermal oxidation behaviors of three kinds of experimental third generation single crystal superalloys with different tungsten contents were investigated at 1100 degrees C in air by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning election microscopy (SEM) and energy disperse X-ray analysis (EDS). The results show that three kinds of alloys approximately obey subparabolic rate law during oxidation at 1100 degrees C for 100 h. The mass gain of 8 wt% W-containing alloy is higher than that of 6 wt% and 7 wt% W-containing alloys. The oxide scale exposed at 1100 degrees C consists of three layers: an outer Ni(Co)O layer, an intermediate layer mainly composed of oxides and spinels, and an inner Al2O3 layer. The gamma'-free layer is formed in the base alloy. In the current alloy system, the transition of oxidation mechanism happens with increasing W content at 1100 degrees C; therefore, it is found that the alloys with W content less than 7% exhibit relative balance between oxidation resistance and solution strength.

   with single alpha-Al2O3 film at 1000 degrees C
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB Detailed long-term of 2000 h oxidation behavior of a Ni-based single crystal superalloy was investigated at 1000 degrees C. In the first oxidation stage, alpha-Al2O3 formed immediately, and then the mass gain curve obeys the parabolic law, which corresponds to the growth of alpha-Al2O3 film. A single alpha-Al2O3 film kept on the surface of the specimen before 750 h oxidation. The oxidation is controlled by the inward diffusion of oxygen anions to react with Al cations at the oxide/metal interface. The shape of the exfoliation region of single alpha-Al2O3 film is closed to an annulus, in which the (Ni, Co)O layer formed due to depletion of Al. The three-layer oxide scale formed rapidly after 750 h oxidation. With the continue consumption of Al, a discontinuous inner alpha-Al2O3 layer formed, making oxide scale spall seriously and gain mass rapidly. The states of alpha-Al2O3 film, the controlled film, are different in dendrite core and interdendritic region. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB The single crystal superalloy Rene'N5 (with or without Y-doping and hydrogen annealing) was cyclically oxidized at 1150 degreesC for 1000 h. After considerable scale growth (greater than or equal to 500 h), even the adherent alumina scales formed on Y-doped samples exhibited delayed interfacial spallation during subsequent water immersion tests. performed up to I year after oxidation. Spallation was characterized by weight loss, the amount of spalled area and acoustic emission response. Hydrogen annealing (prior to oxidation) reduced spallation both before and after immersion, but without measurably reducing the bulk sulfur content of the Y-doped alloys. The duration and frequency of sequential. co-located acoustic emission events implied an interfacial crack growth rate at least 10(-3) ms(-1). but possibly higher than 10(2) ms(-1). This is much greater than classic moisture-assisted slow crack growth rates in bulk alumina (10 (6) to 10 (-) (3) m s (- 1)), which may still have occurred undetected by acoustic emission. An alternative failure sequence is proposed: an incubation process for preferential moisture ingress leads to a local decrease in interfacial toughness, thus allowing fast fracture driven by stored strain energy.

TI Ionic segregation on grain boundaries in thermally grown alumina scales
SO MATERIALS AT HIGH TEMPERATURES
AB This study first examined segregation behaviour in the alumina scale formed after 100 h at 1100 degrees C on bare and MCrAlYHfSi-coated single-crystal superalloys with similar to 10 ppma La and Y. For the bare superalloy, Hf and Ti were detected on the grain boundaries of the inner columnar alumina layer. Increasing the oxidation temperature to 1200 degrees C for 2 h did not change the segregation behaviour. With the bond coating, both Y and Hf were segregated to the grain boundaries as expected. However, there was evidence of Ti-rich oxide particles near the gas interface suggesting that Ti diffused from the superalloy through the coating. To further understand these segregation observations with multiple dopants, other alumina-forming systems were examined. Alumina scale grain boundary co-segregation of Ti with Y is common for FeCrAl alloys. Co-segregation of Hf and Ti was observed in the scale formed on co-doped NiAl. No La segregation was detected in the scale formed on NiCrAl with only a 19 ppma La addition, however, the scale was adherent.

TI SULFIDATION-OXIDATION BEHAVIOR OF A NI-CO-CR-SI ALLOY IN AN SO2+O2

SO OXIDATION OF METALS
AB The high-temperature-corrosion behavior of a Ni-Co-Cr-Si superalloy (HAYNES Alloy HR-160) in an SO2+O2 (SO2:O2=2:1) has been studied at 625-degrees-C and 750-degrees-C. Alloy samples were corroded for 72 hr, followed by XRD, SEM, EDS, and XPS analysis on the surface and/or cross-section of the samples, It was found that the simultaneous nucleation of nickel and cobalt oxides and chromia at the initial stage lead to the subsequent formation of a sulphate layer on reaction with the gas phase. This eventually lead to the formation of a thick sulphide layer above the chromia scale. The stable phases for Cr, Ni, and Co in such an atmosphere are chromia as well as Ni and Co sulphates. The existence of a thin sulphate layer was suggested some time ago but could not be detected and was disputed. The XPS analysis in this work now provides evidence for the existence of this sulphate layer. The transport of sulphur through the oxide scale into the alloy substrate is discussed It was concluded that sulphur advanced into the substrate by the oxidation of sulphides, thus liberating the sulphur. The possibility of sulphur transport in the form of SO2 molecules was also discussed. Based on the results and discussion, a schematic corrosion mechanism is presented.

AB MCrAlY alloys can serve as stand-alone overlay coatings or bond coats in thermal barrier coating systems, and their phase constituents play a vital role in determining their performance. In the present investigation, the influence of Co addition on the constituent phases of a NiCrAlY alloy system containing 3 wt.% Re in the temperature range of 800 degrees C-1200 degrees C was predicted through thermodynamic modeling. Based on the modeling results, four NiCrAlY alloy systems with different levels of Co (0,10 wt.%, 20 wt.% and 30 wt.%) were prepared and evaluated experimentally. Scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy results show that the additions of Co increase the fractions of gamma-Ni and beta-NiAl at the expense of gamma'-Ni3Al and alpha-Cr, and thus change the depletion scheme from beta ->gamma' to beta ->gamma during 1100 degrees C oxidation.

TI HIGH TEMPERATURE OXIDATION BEHAVIOR OF A (MCrAlY plus AlSiY) COMPOSITE
   COATING
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB A composite coating (MCrAlY+AlSiY) was prepared on a Ni-based superalloy K465 by arc ion plating technique. The oxidation behaviors of the composite coating and the reference coating NiCoCrAlYSiB were investigated. The results show that the outer layer of composite coating consists of beta-(Ni, Co)Al and dispersed sigma-NiCoCr and Cr3Si, and the inner layer of composite coating consists of Cr-rich phases and minor beta-(Ni, Co)Al after vacuum annealing at 1050 degrees C. Because of the excessive consumption of Al, the spinels and NiO are formed on the surface of the reference coating. For the composite coating, the protective alumina scale is continuous and dense. The enhanced oxidation resistance of the composite coating is related to the gradient distributions of Al-enriched outer layer and Cr-enriched inner layer.

TI Thermal expansion behavior of new Co-based alloys and implications for
   coatings
SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB The thermal expansion behavior of five gamma'-(L1(2)) containing Co-based superalloys was measured using push-rod dilatometry. These results were analyzed to determine the mean coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), the instantaneous CTE, and gamma'-solvus temperature of the alloys. The CTE was found to depend strongly on the gamma'-solvus temperature.
   In turbine applications, these alloys will be part of a multilayer system that generates thermal stresses due to the CTE mismatch between the components. To investigate this phenomenon, the CTE data was incorporated into a thermo-mechanical model to calculate the energy release rate (ERR) for the delamination of coatings from these alloys. The ERR of a thermally grown oxide (TGO) formed on the bare and bond coated Co-based alloys was determined as a function of superalloy and bond coat CTE. The ERR of a thermal barrier coating (TBC) was evaluated as a function of temperature, superalloy LIE, and coating thickness. The ERR was found to be about 1.5 x greater in Co-based superalloys compared to Ni-based superalloys cooled from T = 1100 degrees C to ambient. Strategies for reducing the driving force for delamination are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In the present study, platinum-iridium alloys (Ir = 15.8, 27.3, 36.1, 100at.%) were electroplated on a nickel-base single crystal superalloy TMS-82+ followed by a diffusion treatment at 1373K for 1 h. Interdiffusion behavior between the Pt-Ir films and substrates was investigated in terms of chemical composition, phase constitution and morphology. X-ray analysis revealed that annealed specimens consisted of several fcc solid solutioned phases with various lattice parameters, together with ordered intermetallic compounds (Ll(2)-(Pt,Ni)(3)Al and B2-(IrNi)Al), due to the inward diffusion of Pt and Ir from the electrodeposited films to the superalloy substrates, and the outward diffusion of solute elements (Ni, Al, Cr, Co) in the superalloy substrates into the films during annealing. The depth concentration analysis indicated that the Pt-36.1 Ir film effectively retarded the outward diffusion of solute elements, especially nickel, from the substrate.

TI A magnetron sputtered microcrystalline beta-NiAl coating for SC
   superalloys. Part I. Characterization and comparison of isothermal
   oxidation behavior at 1100 degrees C with a NiCrAlY coating
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB A microcrystalline beta-NiAl coating was prepared on a single-crystal (SC) superalloy substrate via magnetron sputtering and subsequent vacuum annealing. The grain sizes of the coating ranged from about 300 nm to 1 mu m. A reference NiCrAlY coating, which was mainly comprised of gamma'-Ni3Al and alpha-Cr, was prepared by means of vacuum arc evaporation (VAE). Isothermal oxidation tests were carried out at 1100 degrees C in air for 50 h. Both coatings formed thin and adherent alpha-Al2O3 scales during tests, while the oxide scales on the bare superalloy primarily consisted of spinel (Ni,Co)Al2O4 with underlying alpha-Al2O3 scale. The parabolic rate constant of the NiAl-coated specimens was about one order of magnitude lower than that of the NiCrAlY coated specimens. After oxidation tests, only a small amount of gamma' phase was detected at some columnar boundaries of the beta-NiAl coating, and about 2/3 parts of the NiCrAlY coating transformed into gamma phase which resolved the alpha-Cr precipitations, while an Al-depleted zone in thickness of about 10 mu m formed beneath the TGO of the bare superalloy. Inter-diffusion zones and secondary reaction zones were observed on the specimens coated by either beta-NiAl or NiCrAlY. The oxidation mechanism and microstructure evolvement of the specimens during high temperature exposures were discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI High Temperature Oxidation Resistance of NiCrAlYSi Coating Deposited by
   Arc Ion Plating
SO CHINA SURFACE ENGINEERING
AB The high temperature oxidation resistance NiCrAlYSi coating was deposited on nickel-based superalloy DZ22B by arc ion plating. The microstructure, phase and element distribution of the coating were analyzed by SEM, XRD, EDS and electronic probe, respectively. The oxidation behavior of the coating and the substrate were separately investigated at 1 050 degrees C for 200 h. Results show that the coatings are dense and uniform without obvious holes and other defects. After heat treatment, the transition of beta-NiAl to gamma '-Ni3Al occurs and the main phases are gamma '-Ni3Al/gamma-Ni, alpha-Cr and beta-NiAl. The average oxidation rate of coated samples and the substrate alloy are 0.034 0g/(m(2).h) and 0.096 7g/(m(2).h) respectively after 200 h oxidation at a constant temperature of 1 050 degrees C, which indicates that the coatings significantly improve of high temperature oxidation resistance of the substrate. At the early stage of the oxidation, a uniform and dense alpha-Al2O3 protective layer is formed, preventing the diffusion of oxygen into the interior, thus, greatly improves the oxidation resistance. During the process of the oxidation, the element inter-diffusion occurs at the interface between the coating and the substrate, including the internal diffusion of Cr from the coating to the substrate, and the outward diffusion of Co, W and Y from the matrix to the coating.

TI Intergranular crack tip oxidation in a Ni-base superalloy
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB High-temperature intergranular crack tip oxidation under a single 600 s long sustained tensile load at 700 degrees C was studied for the Ni-base superalloy Allvac 718Plus. High-resolution analytical techniques showed oxidation to take place at and immediately ahead of the tip of an open crack, forming a closed but layered oxide structure about the prior (now oxidized) grain boundary. Near the prior grain boundary the oxide is Ni-rich, with a Co-enriched layer furthest away from the metal and a Fe-enriched region below this. A Cr-rich oxide is present below the outer Ni-rich oxides throughout the crack, also in the direction of crack growth. This is believed to have a hindering effect on oxidation ahead of the crack. Ni-3(Nb,Al) gamma' precipitates close to the grain boundaries were found to oxidize and form regions of near-stoichiometric NiO within the oxide layers. Remaining constituents of gamma' (e.g. Al and Nb) were found to be enriched in the surrounding oxidized matrix and also to produce thin oxide layers near the interface between the unoxidized metal and the Cr-rich oxide. The formation of the crack tip oxides is discussed with regard to thermodynamics, kinetics and the influence of applied mechanical load. (C) 2013 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Experimental Study on the Oxidation and Diffusion Behavior of Inconel
   625 and Tool Materials
SO CRYSTALS
AB Oxidation and diffusion simulation experiments were conducted to choose the most suitable material for cutting the Inconel 625 superalloy. Three tool materials, WC/Co, coated carbide, and ceramic were used as tool materials in the oxidation simulation experiment. The three tool materials were heated for 30 min in a high-temperature furnace, and the high-temperature oxidation products were examined with scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Tools were heated for 90 min in a vacuum tube furnace. The element diffusion behaviors of Inconel 625 and the tool materials were analysed with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and XRD. Some of the WC and Co in the WC/Co and coated carbide tool materials was oxidized to WO3, Co3O4, and CoWO4, and the oxidation reaction became more intense as the temperature increased. For the ceramic tool, only TiC was oxidized to TiO2, which indicates good oxidation resistance. In the diffusion couple experiments, the diffusion levels of the three tool materials increased with temperature, but the degree of influence differed. Diffusion of elements was hindered by the (Al, Ti) N coating of the coated carbide and effectively inhibited by the Al2O3 in the ceramic tool. In terms of oxidation and diffusion, the most suitable tool material for cutting Inconel 625 was the ceramic, followed by the coated carbide and then WC/Co.

TI Cyclic Oxidation and Hot Corrosion Behavior of Plasma-Sprayed CoCrAlY
   plus WC-Co Coating on Turbine Alloys
SO JOURNAL OF FAILURE ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION
AB Components in energy-producing systems suffer a variety of degradation processes such as oxidation and molten salt-induced corrosion as a consequence of complex multi-component gaseous environment. Coatings provide a composition that will grow the protective scale at high temperatures having long-term stability. Plasma spraying was used to deposit CoCrAlY + WC-Co composite coatings on turbine alloys of Hastelloy X and AISI 321. The thermocyclic oxidation behavior of coated alloys was investigated in static air and in molten salt (Na2SO4-60%V2O5) environment at 700 degrees C. The thermogravimetric technique was used to approximate the kinetics of oxidation in 50 cycles, each cycle consisting of heating and cooling. X-ray diffraction and SEM/EDAX techniques are used to characterize the oxide scale formed. Coated alloys showed a lower corrosion rate as compared to uncoated alloys. The coatings subjected to oxidation and hot corrosion showed slow scale growth kinetics. Preferential oxidation of Co, Cr, W and its spinel blocks the transport of oxygen and corrosive species into the coating by providing a barrier, thereby making the oxidation rate to reach steady state. As compared to the substrate alloys, coatings show better hot corrosion resistance.

TI Cycle oxidation behavior of nanostructured Ni60-TiB2 composite coating
   sprayed by HVOF technique
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB Cycle oxidation resistance at 800 degrees C in static air was investigated for a nanostructured Ni60-TiB2 composite coating sprayed by high velocity oxy-fuel (HVOF). For comparison, a Ni60-TiB2 conventional composite coating was also studied. The results indicate that, the oxidation processes of both composite coatings are controlled by diffusion mechanism, and the nanostructured composite coating has better cycle oxidation resistance than that of the conventional composite coating. The reasons for this improvement can be attributed to the formation of the intact SiO2 and Cr2O3 protective layer, and the enhanced adhesion between oxide film and nanostructure coating.

AB A new Fe-Ni-Co-Nb-Ti-Si superalloy containing trace additions of selective rare earths and having good combination of very low thermal expansion coefficient, high-resistance to stress accelerated grain boundary oxygen ernbrittlement and fairly good notch-bar rupture strength has been successfully developed. The resistance to oxidation for long time exposure at high-temperatures and the stress rupture life has been improved significantly with trace yttrium addition. The microstructures of the alloys have been studied by means of analytical electron microscopy, chemical and X-ray analysis techniques. The results reveal that the trace Yttrium segregates in the strengthening phase with platelet morphology, and helps in transforming A(3)B type epsilon phase into A(5)B type H phase. The morphology and crystal structures of the grain boundary phases also change with selective additions of rare earth elements. Compared with those in the conventional alloy, the platelet precipitates in the yttrium-containing alloy densely segregate within the grains and along the grain boundaries with smaller size. The segregation of the platelet precipitates within the grains is helpful in improving the strength of the alloy. In addition, its precipitation along the grain boundaries can improve the resistance to stress accelerated grain boundary oxidation and stress rupture property of the alloy and thereby contribute to its temperature stability.

AB 2 at.% and 4 at.% Mo were added to Co-9Al-9W-2Ta-0.02B alloy to replace W (hereafter referred to as the alloys of 2Mo and 4Mo, respectively; Mo-free alloy was referred to as the 0Mo alloy). The effects of Mo additions on the high temperature oxidation behavior of the alloys at 800 degrees C in air have been studied. The results indicated that, after oxidation in air at 800 degrees C for 100 h, the oxide film of the 0Mo alloy remained intact, but the cracking and spallation of the oxide film took place in the alloys of 2Mo and 4Mo. Oxidation kinetic curves revealed weight gain per unit area of the 0Mo alloy was 36.86 mg.cm(-2), which was lower than that of the alloys of 2Mo (65.16 mg.cm(-2)) and 4Mo (48.54mg.cm(-2)). These suggested that the 0Mo alloy displayed superior oxidation resistance compared to the alloys of 2Mo and 4Mo caused by the formation of volatile MoO3 oxide, and sharp compressive stress formed in the outer layer during the oxidation. The oxide layer was composed of three layers of the Co3O4 + CoO outer layer, middle complex oxide layer containing Co, Al and W (Mo), inner Al2O3 layer and y/Co3W zone adhere to the gamma/gamma' substrate.

During the co-deposition process, the phase structure formed on the coating surface changes with the increasing of hafnium contents in packs. When the hafnium contents are 2 wt%, 6 wt% and 12 wt% the coatings consist of the gamma-Ni+gamma'-Ni3Al, beta-NiAl+Al16Hf6Ni7, and Al16Hf6Ni7, respectively. During post heat treatment the beta-NiAl+Al16Hf6Ni7 and Al16Hf6Ni7 coatings are transformed to gamma-Ni+gamma'-Ni3Al and gamma-Ni+gamma'-Ni3Al+Al3HfNi12. Isothermal oxidation tests at 1100 degrees C for 10 h show that there are a lot of spallation on the surface of the substrate without coating, while the Pt and Hf modified gamma-Ni+gamma'-Ni3Al coating formed in the packs with 2 wt% Hf remains to be integrated after being oxidized for 30 h. The addition of the reactive element hafnium makes a further improvement on the oxidation resistance of the Pt+gamma-Ni+gamma'-Ni3Al coatings.

AB A new Ni-base Nb-containing supealloy of low Co-Mo, Ni-24Cr-16(Co+Mo+W)-4.5(Nb+Ti+A1)-0.03C (wt. %), was designed for 700 degrees C advanced ultra-super-critical power plant application, and the boiler superheater/reheater tubes were successfully manufactured. The alloy design was conducted by thermodynamics and dynamics calculation using Thermal-Calc and JmatPro commercial software. The microstructural stability of the new alloy was evaluated by FESEM and TEM. The mechanical properties, such as microhardness and impact toughness at room temperature, were also tested. The calculation results show that molybdenum promotes the formation of a and t phase obviously and cobalt promotes the formation of a, and t simultaneously. In addition, high molybdenum content will decrease the flue gas ash corrosion resistance and cobalt is a kind of strategic resource in the world. Therefore, the concept of "low Co-Mo Ni-base superalloy" was determined. The implementation of "Low Co-Mo" can reduce cost, restrain the formation of harmful phases as well as ensure good oxidation/corrosion resistance on the basis of high Cr content. To optimize the new alloy, both the combined solid solution strengthening of Cr-Co-Mo-W and the precipitation strengthening elements Nb, Ti and Al are adopted, because Nb is a good 7'-strengthening element in combination with Ti and Al for Ni-base superalloy. The experimental results of SEM and TEM show that no harmful phases precipitate after 1000 h-aging at 760 degrees C and 800 degrees C, and the 7' coarsening rate is low, which reveals a good microstructure stability of this new alloy.

TI Oxidation properties in CO(2) of Inconel alloy 600 coated by
   simultaneous aluminizing-chromizing process
SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF AERONAUTICS
AB IN 600 alloy was coated with two different types of coatings, Cr-modified aluminide coating this is called aluminizing-chromizing and Y-doped chromium modified aluminide coating this is called aluminizing-chromizing-yttriumizing. Diffusion coating was carried at 1050 degrees C for 8 h under Ar atmosphere by simultaneous aluminizing-chromizing process and by simultaneous aluminizing-chromizing-yttriumizing. Cyclic oxidation tests were conducted on the uncoated and on the coated Inconel 600 alloy in the temperature range 800-1000 degrees C in CO(2) for 100 h at 10 h cycle. The results showed that the oxidation kinetics for uncoated Inconel 600 alloy in CO(2) is parabolic and the phases present are NiO, (Fe, Cr)(2)O(3), NiFe(2)O(4) and NiCrO(4). The oxidation kinetics for both coated systems in CO(2) was found to be parabolic and the value of k(P) for both coated systems were found to be lower than that for uncoated Inconel 600 alloy. Oxide phases that formed on coated systems are Al(2)O(3) and NiCrO(4). The role of yttrium can be attributed to its ability to improve the adherence of the oxide scale.

AB The 1150 degrees C oxidation behavior of gamma + gamma'-based alloys containing up to 20 at.% Pt and 15-22 at.% Al was investigated in an effort to further develop and optimize alternative bond coating compositions for advanced thermal barrier coating systems. It was found that the co-addition of Pt and Hf was extremely beneficial to oxidation resistance, to the extent that Ni-20Al-20Pt-Hf and Ni-20Al-10Pt-Hf alloys oxidized at significantly slower rates than a Ni-50Al-15Pt beta-NiAl alloy. Moreover it was found that there is an optimum Hf content that depends on Pt content in the alloy. A feasible method to deposit Pt + Hf-modified gamma + gamma' coatings having overall compositions closely approaching those targeted (Ni-Al15-20-Pt15-20-Hf) on the basis of the bulk-alloy study was subsequently developed. Cyclic oxidation testing of a representative gamma + gamma' coating at 1150 degrees C in air revealed the absence of surface rumpling and excellent compatibility with the superalloy substrate as major advantages compared to traditional Pt-modified beta-NiAl coatings.

TI Microstructure and hot corrosion behaviors of two Co modified aluminide
   coatings on a Ni-based superalloy at 700 degrees C
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB Two Co modified aluminide coatings with different Co contents were prepared by pack cementation process and above-the-pack process. The hot corrosion tests of the two coatings were performed in mixed salts of 75 wt.% Na2SO4 + 25 wt.% K2SO4 and 75 wt.% Na2SO4 +25 wt.% NaCI at 700 degrees C, with a simple aluminide coating as the reference coating. X-Ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) with energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS) were used to characterize the coatings and the corrosion scales. Results indicate that the addition of Co improves the hot corrosion resistance of the simple aluminide coating in the mixed sulfate salts, for the sulfide as well as its eutectic of cobalt are more stable, and possess higher melting points than those of nickel. While in the mixed salt containing chloride, the coating with medium Co content possesses the best corrosion resistance, primarily because the nitrides formed in the deposition process deteriorate the corrosion resistance of the coating with highest Co content.

TI EFFECT OF PREALUMINIZATION ON THE PROPERTIES OF ZRO2-8 WT-PERCENT
   Y2O3/CO-29CR-6AL-1Y THERMAL-BARRIER COATINGS
SO OXIDATION OF METALS
AB Specimens of investment-cast Mar-M247 superalloy were vacuum-plasma sprayed with Co-29Cr-6Al-1Y bond coat, and part of the specimens were further pre-aluminized at 980-degrees-C for 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 hours. All the specimens were then deposited with ZrO2-8 wt.% Y2O3 thermal-barrier coatings (TBCs) and thermally cycled at 1050-degrees-C to evaluate the effect of time of the prealuminizing treatment on the performance and failure mechanism of the modified system. Results showed that TBC specimens with pre-aluminized bond coatings exhibited lower oxidation rates and significantly higher cyclic life when compared with unaluminized specimens. The failure of bond-coat pre-aluminized TBC specimens was observed to propagate mainly along the lamellar splats of the top coat, whereas the failure of conventional TBC specimens occurred mainly along the top-coat/spinel oxides interface.

TI Isothermal oxidation and hot corrosion behaviors of diffusion aluminide
   coatings deposited by chemical vapor deposition
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Aluminization has been employed on superalloys to form dense and adhesive alumina surface layers to prolong their service life at high temperature. A chemical vapor deposited aluminizing process had been employed to deposit nickel aluminide coatings on the nickel-based single-crystal superalloys. The kinetics behavior, phase evaluation, microstructure and chemical composition of the aluminide coatings after oxidation and hot corrosion tests were studied in detail. After isothermal oxidation test, a dense and protective alpha-Al2O3 surface layer is formed on the aluminized superalloy and phase transformation reactions occur in the aluminide layer and interdiffusion zone. The inward diffusion of Al element toward the substrate and formation of micro-pores in the interdiffusion zone are probably the main degradation modes of the aluminide coating. Corrosive medium including of mixed of aviation fuels and artificial seawater has not serious deterioration of aluminide coating after hot corrosion at 1123 K, although large of micro-pores and few of microcracks are observed within the aluminide layer, and the typical morphology of the aluminide layer becomes corse and disorder to a certain extent.

TI Effect of rare earth on the microstructures and properties of a low
   expansion superalloy
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB A new Fe-Ni-Co-Nb-Ti-Si superalloy containing trace additions of selective rare earths and having with combination of very low thermal expansion coefficient, high resistance to stress accelerated grain boundary oxygen embrittlement and fairly good notch-bar rupture strength has been successfully developed. The resistance to oxidation for long time exposure at high temperatures and the stress rupture life improves significantly with trace yttrium additions. The microstructures of the alloy have been studied by means of analytical electron microscopy and chemical analysis techniques. The results reveal that the rare earth element segregates in the strengthening phase of platelet morphology. Further it helps in transforming A(3)B type epsilon phase into A(5)B type H phase. The morphology and crystal structures of the grain boundary phases also change with selective additions of rare earth elements. The platelet precipitates become smaller and denser, and forms within the grains and along the grain boundaries with the additions of rare earth elements. The segregation of the platelet precipitates within the grains is helpful in improving the strength of the alloy. In addition its precipitation along the grain boundaries can improve the resistance to stress accelerated grain boundary oxidation and stress rupture property of the alloy and thereby contributed to its excellent elevated temperature stability.

TI Oxidation Behavior of Modified Low Thermal Expansion Thermo-Span
   Superalloy at 650 degrees C
SO RARE METAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING
AB Modified Thermo-Span superalloys of low thermal expansion have high comprehensive tensile and low thermal expansion coefficient. Compare to standard alloy, their Cr element content was decreased and Al element was increased. By means of thermogravimetry (TG), scanning electron microscopy equipped with electron probe (EPMA), the distribution of trace element B in Thermo-Span alloy and its influence on oxidation behavior at 650 degrees C for 100 h have been investigated. The results show that B element in modified Thermo-Span alloy can accelerate precipitation on grain boundaries, and boride precipitation in grain boundaries. The oxidization behavior follows the parabolic curve rule. During the oxidation process, Fe and Co diffuse from the matrix to the outside oxidation layer, and Al, Cr and Ti diffuse from the transition layer towards the matrix. Fe, Co and 0 elements enrich on surface oxidation layer, which forms oxides of Fe and Co, and oxides of Fe in standard alloy. At the same time, Al and Cr are leaning to enrich in the layer between the surface layer and matrix, and there is no Fe and Co element in this middle layer. Boride resists the diffusion of iron from the matrix to the oxidation layer, decreasing the Fe element diffuses outside, the surface oxides of Fe decreasing, and forming the oxides of Fe and Co, hence decreasing the oxide rate of modification Thermo-Span alloy at 650 degrees C for 100 h, and increasing its oxidation resistance.

SO CORROSION SCIENCE
AB A Hf-doped beta-(Ni,Pt)Al coating was prepared by co-deposition of a Pt-Hf composite plating and successive aluminisation. Then, a distinct Hf-rich belt was formed internally between the outer additive (Ni,Pt)Al coating and interdiffusion zone. An isothermal oxidation test at 1100 degrees C revealed a relatively lower oxidation rate constant and decreased oxide scale rumpling tendency for the Hf-doped coating during which the Hf-rich belt partly acted as an effective diffusion barrier. The unique addition of Hf into a beta-(NLPt)Al coating can delay the transitional oxidation period from transient alumina to stable one and postpone the degradation from beta to gamma'.

CY JUL 13-17, 2004
CL Singapore, SINGAPORE
AB The hot-section components in commercial aerogas turbines were typically made of nickel-based superalloys and were protected by coatings. Two kinds of diffusion aluminide coatings, including simple aluminide coating and NiCr-CrAl coating, were prepared on a nickel-based cast superalloy by LP-VCD and pack cementation techniques, respectively. The isothermal oxidation behavior of the cast alloy and the coatings at 1000 and 1100 degrees C and their hot corrosion behaviors in the presence of 75 wt.% Na2SO4+K2SO4 film at 900 degrees C were studied using TGA, scanning electron microscopy (SEM)/energy-dispersive spectrometry (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and electron probe microanalysis (EPMA), respectively. The results showed that NiCr-CrAl coating, not only held a very excellent oxidation resistance due to the alpha-Al2O3 formation on the coating surface during the isothermal process at 1000 and 1100 degrees C, but also possessed excellent hot corrosion resistance in sulphate melt. Internal oxidation and nitridation were found in the cast alloy during the oxidation process. Moreover, the cast alloy suffered from catastrophic hot corrosion, resulting in the serious internal oxidation and sulfidation. The oxidation resistance of the simple aluminide coating was superior to the cast alloy; the simple aluminide coating was damaged completely and lost its protective effect after the hot corrosion test. In addition, the mechanisms for oxidation and corrosion of the cast alloy and the coatings are discussed simultaneously. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Damage mechanisms of coated systems under thermomechanical fatigue
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The damage mechanisms of several kinds of coatings on a single crystal nickel base superalloy under thermomechanical fatigue (TMF) are described. The systems investigated were diffusion platinum aluminide coatings, Co-Ni-Cr-Al-Y overlay coatings, and thermal barrier coatings (TBCs). The TMF experiments were carried out on hollow specimens over a temperature range from 300 to 1050 degrees C, at strain ranges Delta epsilon = 0.5 and 0.7%, and at a strain ratio R = -infinity. No coating cracking was found for the platinum aluminide coating. Instead, specimens failed owing to oxidation induced crack initiation from the uncoated inner surface of the hollow testpieces, although coating surface roughening caused by non-homogeneous oxidation was observed. For the overlay coating, roughening in terms of coating rumpling and coating cracking occurred, resulting in reduced TMF life, For TBC-specimens with a thin ceramic coating processed by electron beam-physical vapour deposition (EB-PVD), TMF life was compatible with that of specimens with the overlay coating. Failure once again occurred owing to Co-Ni-Cr-Al-Y bond coat cracking and propagation into the substrate. In this system, some bond coat cracks penetrated through the top ceramic coat although others did not. In contrast with specimens coated with the overlay alone, no significant rumpling on the bond coat surface was observed and the crack density was low. MST/4233.

TI Comparative evaluation of hot corrosion resistance of nanostructured
   AlCrN and TiAlN coatings on cobalt-based superalloys
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS RESEARCH
AB Molten vanadate-induced hot corrosion is the major cause of failure of superalloys which are generally used at higher temperatures (such as in internal combustion engines, gas turbines, high temperature tooling and dies, and petrochemical industries and marines). This effect can be minimized by applying thermally stable coatings over the superalloy. In this aspect, the current work investigates the effect of nanostructured aluminum chromium nitride (AlCrN) and titanium aluminum nitride (TiAlN) coatings on the hot corrosion behavior of Co-based superalloy, Superco-605, in an aggressive environment of Na2SO4-60% V2O5 (ratio by weight) at 700 degrees C up to 80 cycles. Each cycle consisted of 1 h heating at 700 degrees C followed by 20 min cooling in an ambient temperature. Hot corrosion kinetics was studied using the thermogravimetric technique and found to follow the parabolic rate law. The corrosion surface morphology and phases formed during hot corrosion were studied using field emission scanning electron microscopy equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction techniques. It was found that AlCrN coating had a better hot corrosion resistance than TiAlN coating.

TI Fatigue crack growth behavior of a newly developed Ni-Co-base superalloy
   TMW-2 at elevated temperatures
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB Fatigue crack growth (FCG) rates of a new superalloy TMW-2 in air was studied by a fracture mechanics test method. Compact tension specimens were tested under load control with a triangular wave form to investigate the effects of temperature (400, 650, and 725 degrees C) and load ratio (0.05 and 0.5) on FCG rates. The results showed that the FCG rates increased significantly with increasing the temperature. Compared with the creep effects, the results showed that the degradation of mechanical properties and the oxidation assisted crack growth may dominate the FCG rates of TMW-2 at elevated temperatures. Load ratio had a little (at 400 degrees C) or moderate (at 650 and 725 degrees C) influence on the FCG rates, which increased as the load ratio increased. The load ratio effects were successfully accounted for by applying the Walker model. The fractographic observations showed that the fracture mode was transgranular at 400 degrees C and was mixed transgranular and intergranular at 650 and 725 degrees C. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

SO CHEMICKE LISTY
AB The influence of oxidation temperature on the hardness and microstructure of Co-base alloy coatings were investigated. Coatings were manufactured by PTA cladding on a valve steel X40CrSiMo10-2 substrate. The cobalt alloy was exposed to high temperatures in air from 750 degrees C to 1100 degrees C and in exhaust gases at 750 degrees C. As a result of oxidation treatment the changes in microhardness for cobalt layers were observed. In the outer surface sublayer with thickness of about 0,3 mm a significant decrease of hardness was found. The higher temperature was applied, the bigger decrease of hardness was observed. The hardness measurement presents more sensitive reaction on material changes during the heat treatment than microstructural analyzes.

TI Mechanical properties and fracture modes of an advanced Ni-Co-base disk
   superalloy at elevated temperatures
SO MATERIALS CHARACTERIZATION
AB The successful development of an advanced cast and wrought disk alloy, TMW-4M3, was initiated in the NEDO program supported by the Japanese government in cooperation with Mitsubishi Materials Corporation. This paper reports the mechanical properties and fracture modes of TMW-4M3 disk alloy, in order to support its high temperature uses and to understand prospective failure scenarios. The mechanical properties and fracture modes of tensile, creep, low cycle fatigue, and fatigue crack growth were evaluated up to 760 degrees C on specimens machined from the full-scale pancake-shaped disk. The excellent overall mechanical properties of TMW-4M3 alloy were demonstrated. Fracture modes were compared with different testing conditions and fractographic examinations indicated that the fracture modes shifted with changing test conditions. Surface crack initiation was the main failure mode at elevated temperatures. Crack propagation rate was accelerated above 650 degrees C due primarily to oxidation and degradation of mechanical strength. The results indicated that the TMW-4M3 alloy has at least 650 degrees C general capabilities and is promising for 700 degrees C or more applications. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

SO OXIDATION OF METALS
AB A novel, low-expansion experimental Ni-Cr-Al-Ti-Si bond-coating alloy was investigated in the as-cast state concerning its phase stability, oxidation resistance in ail, and interdiffusion with single-crystal IN-100 at 900, 1000, and 1100 degrees C. Isothermal oxidative thermogravimetry was employed up to 500 hr. Interdiffusion was compared to a commercial Ni-Co-Cr-Al-Y alloy on IN-100. Oxidized Ni-Cl-Al-Ti-Si specimens and diffusion couples were characterized by metallography, SEM, EDX, XRD, and XRF. The Ni-Cr-Al-Ti-Si alloy provides good oxidation resistance in aii at least up to 1000 degrees C. The alloy is an alumina former. Due to its coarse microstructure, other oxides (e.g., rutile) may form and considerably nominate the oxidation behavior. The kinetics of oxidation were correlated with temperature, formation of phases, and morphology of oxides. Interdiffusion fluxes between Ni-Cr-Al-Ti-Si and IN-100 were mainly directed to the superalloy. They were faster than in Ni-Co-Cr-Al-Y/IN-100 diffusion couples.

This precipitate was identified as the hexagonal topologically close-packed (TCP) mu phase with lattice parameters a = 0.473 nm and c = 2.565 nm. The energy-dispersive x-ray (EDX) spectrum of the mu phase suggested a refractory element rich compound comprising the elements Re, W, and Co. Twin domains parallel to (001) were found in the mu phase. The mechanisms of the mu phase and twinning formation were discussed.

TI Oxidation of single crystal PWA 1483 at 950 degrees C in flowing air
SO CORROSION SCIENCE
AB The oxidation behaviour of single crystal PWA 1483 at 950 degrees C was investigated by means of XRD, SEM and EDS. The Parabolic oxidation behaviour, as defined by mass gain and the respective oxide layer thicknesses, is characterized by a parabolic rate constant of about 4 x 10(-6) mg(2)/(cm(4) x s) and the formation of a multi-layered oxide scale. An outer scale contains a Ti-bearing thin film composed of TiO2 and NiTiO3 but mostly Cr in Cr2O3 and (Ni/Co)Cr2O4 besides NiTaO4. This outer scale is connected to a discontinuous layer of Al2O3 and an area of gamma'-depletion within the base material. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Effect of Rhenium Addition on Isothermal Oxidation Behavior of Tribaloy
   T-800 Alloy
SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF AERONAUTICS
AB The effects of 4 wt% rhenium (Re) addition on isothermal oxidation behavior of Tribaloy T-800 alloy have been studied at 800 degrees C and 1 000 degrees C in air. At 800 degrees C, T-800 shows nonuniform oxidation between dendritic and eutectic areas. Re addition clearly promotes the nonuniform oxidation, leading to considerably higher mass gains than that of T-800 at this temperature. At 1 000 degrees C exposure, the thickness of scale on T-800 increases significantly, accompanied by severe scale spallation during cooling to room temperature. On the contrary, T-800Re shows a marked decrease of oxide growth rate compared to the linear one of T-800 at 1 000 degrees C. The scale adhesion is also improved with Re addition at this higher temperature. Therefore, the role of Re depends on the exposure temperature. Re addition gives high oxidation rate at 800 degrees C, however, the excellent oxidation resistance is obtained by the addition of Re at a higher temperature of 1 000 degrees C.

TI Synthesis of simple and platinum-modified aluminide coatings on cobalt

SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB An investigation was conducted to synthesize simple beta-CoAl or beta-(Co,Ni)Al coatings and platinum (Pt)-modified aluminide coatings on cobalt-base superalloys via an industrial vapor phase aluminizing process. Surface morphology and cross-section microstructure of the developed coatings were studied and compared by using optical microscope, scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). Experimental results showed that Al increase in Al-Cr nuggets increases the coating thickness; substrate elements influence the formation of coatings; the increase of the electrodeposited Pt thickness increases the amount of xi PtAl(2) phase after aluminizing process; and the transformation of xi PtAl(2) phase into beta-(Co,Ni,Pt)Al phase can be obtained via a heat treatment process.

TI Microstructure evolution of vacuum plasma sprayed CoNiCrAlY coatings
   after heat treatment and isothermal oxidation
SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB The microstructure of a CoNiCrAlY coating vacuum plasma sprayed onto an aluminized MARM002 Ni-base superalloy was investigated in the as-deposited condition, after heat treatment to promote adhesion, and after oxidation in air for 100 h at 1100 degrees C. The as-sprayed coating comprised three main phases: the solid solution gamma-(Ni, Co), the intermetallic compound p-(Ni, Co)Al and the intermetallic compound gamma'-(Ni, CO)(3)Al that grew as small precipitates inside gamma grains. gamma' phase was present even in the as-sprayed condition because of Al diffusion into the coating from the aluminized substrate during manufacture at temperatures of 800-1000 degrees C. The microstructure was fine-scale and complex with beta phase within gamma grains, at gamma grain boundaries and large beta grains surrounded by gamma matrix. After heat treatment, the microstructure comprised p grains typically of 3-mu m diameter randomly distributed throughout the gamma matrix. There was little or no Al depletion of the coating because of Al diffusion from the substrate aluminized layer. Diffusion of C from the substrate induced the formation of Cr23C6 and M5Y (where M was predominantly Ni and Co) in the assprayed coating; with M5Y transforming to Y2O3 during heat treatment due to internal oxidation. After oxidation, there was a loss of Al despite the aluminized layer, because of the formation of a thermally grown oxide (TGO) layer on the upper surface of the coating, mainly comprising Al2O3 with some Cr2O3. There was a corresponding reduction in p phase fraction and a substantial reduction in the substrate aluminized layer thickness. Some grains persisted close to the TGO at grain boundaries, together with Y2O3 and Cr23C6 particles. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Bondcoats used to protect turbine blades, such as platinum modified NiAl alloys, are designed to develop a protective alumina scale during exposure conditions at high temperatures. However, during high temperature oxidation, the system is subjected to chemical and microstructural changes that arise from the consumption of aluminium to ensure alumina growth and interdiffusion between the underlying nickel-based superalloy and the bondcoat.
   The aim of the present work is to report experimental results concerning the chemical and microstructural evolutions of a NiPtAl bondcoat, deposited on a single crystal nickel-based superalloy, during isothermal oxidation tests at 1100 degrees C, up to 50 h.
   Analytical STEM studies were carried out, in conjunction with Auger experiments, in order to follow the various changes that occur in the bondcoat and at the Al2O3/bondcoat interface. Efforts were concentrated on the effect of interfacial sulfur segregation (at both intact interface and void surface) as a function of the oxidation time, as well as its dependence on phase transformations in the external layer of the bondcoat. Strong S segregation at some bondcoat NiPtAl/Al2O3 interface, especially at gamma '/Al2O3, was found in co-segregation with Cr, which has diffused from the substrate. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB Recent advances in coal combustion have made coal a cleaner, more viable source for power generation. Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) plants pair conventional steam turbines and coal gas turbines. The overall efficiency of each system is largely dependent on the maximum operating temperature of the system, which is limited by the available materials. Superalloys have long been used as a turbine material due to their high temperature strength and general resistance to oxidation. Superalloy GTD-111 DS is currently being used as components in steam turbine engine such as turbine blades and discs and is now being introduced to the syngas environment, which consists of H-2, CO, CH4, and H2S in addition to H2O. H2S is highly corrosive and complicates the corrosion process. The high temperature corrosion behavior of a directionally solidified superalloy, GTD-111 DS has been studied using thermogravimtric analysis coupled with metallographic studies. Parabolic oxidation behavior was observed for test environments including dry and wet air. Simulated syngas environments show aggressive sulfidization that leads to massive sample damage. In the case of wet syngas environments, a protective oxide layer was observed which seem to increase the samples ability to resist further corrosion.

   TaC-containing cast alloys
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB A series of six alloys derived from a Ni-25Cr-0.4C-6Ta (wt.%) base one was developed by substituting nickel by cobalt. They were synthesized by casting and exposed to oxidative environment at two high temperatures. Their bulk microstructures were studied in as-cast condition and in two high temperature aged states. Their surfaces after oxidation during aging were characterized. The cobalt enrichment succeeded in avoiding chromium carbides formation and in stabilizing the TaC carbides at high temperature. As the high temperature morphologic stability of TaC was not perfect, it was much better than the one of the chromium carbides, but can be improved by the total removal of nickel. Unfortunately, at the same time, the oxidation behavior, initially good, shows increased rate of the oxides formation. The room temperature hardness was also significantly increased by the substitution of Ni by Co, and decreased after aging when carbides became rounder or fragmented. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI Effects of cyclic stress and temperature on oxidation damage of a
   nickel-based superalloy
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB Oxidation damage, combined with fatigue, is a concern for nickel-based superalloys utilised as disc rotors in high pressure compressor and turbine of aero-engines. A study has been carried out for a nickel-based alloy RR1000, which includes cyclic experiments at selected temperatures (700-800 degrees C) and microscopy examination using focused ion beam (FIB). The results suggest that the major mechanism of oxidation damage consists of the formation of surface oxide scales and internal micro-voids and oxide particles beneath the oxide scales, which become more severe with the increase of temperature. Applying a cyclic stress does not change the nature of oxidation damage but tends to enhance the extent of oxidation damage for temperatures at 750 degrees C and 800 degrees C. The influence of cyclic stress on oxidation damage appears to be insignificant at 700 degrees C, indicating a combined effect of cyclic stress and temperature. Further energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDXS) analyses show the enrichment of Cr and Ti, together with lower Ni and Co levels, in the surface oxide scales, suggesting the formation of brittle Cr2O3, TiO2, NiO and Co3O4 oxides on the specimen surface. Penetration of oxygen into the material and associated internal oxidation, which leads to further material embrittlement and associated failure, are evidenced from both secondary ion imaging and EDXS analyses.

AB The Al/W ratio was increased in a new polycrystalline gamma/gamma' Co-based superalloy in order to introduce a grain boundary pinning phase while at the same time reducing the density and increasing the oxidation resistance. The grain boundary pinning phase was identified as beta-phase (B2-(Ni,Co)Al) by high-energy X-ray diffraction. The grain boundary pinning effect was confirmed to be effective up to temperatures of 1050 degrees C by synchrotron radiation in-situ heating experiments. The precipitation of the beta phase led to a reduced gamma' volume fraction thereby decreasing the high-temperature strength. The density was lowered to 8.52 g/cm(3), so the specific strength was equivalent to the strength of the reference alloy up to 750 degrees C. Due to the low gamma' volume fraction and the low W content, the creep resistance was also reduced compared with the reference alloy. The oxidation resistance, however, was improved by the formation of a thin, continuous Al-oxide layer during oxidation at 900 degrees C for 50 hours.

TI A new computational approach for modelling the microstructural evolution
   and residual lifetime assessment of MCrAlY coatings
SO MATERIALS AT HIGH TEMPERATURES
AB MCrAlY (M=Ni, Co) coatings are commonly used to protect the underlying superalloy component in industrial gas turbines and aeroengines from oxidation attack. They also function as bond coats for thermal barrier coatings (TBC). The chemical life time of the coated component is mainly governed by the depletion of the beta-phase in the bond coat as a result of simultaneously occurring surface oxidation and interdiffusion between the coating and the substrate. A new computational approach to model the microstructural evolution in MCrAlY (M=Ni, Co) coatings on Ni base superalloys was undertaken in the present study. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and wavelength dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (WDX) was employed to characterise MCrAlY coated superalloy samples after exposure at 1000 and 1100 degrees C. Phases were identified by electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and correlated with SEM/EDX/WDX analyses.
   Modelling of the microstructural evolution was carried out considering simultaneously occurring surface oxidation and interdiffusion processes. A flux based calculation of the concentration profiles and stable phases was performed, taking into account diffusion of all elements in the gamma, gamma ' and beta-NiAl phases. Good agreement was found between the observed and computed phase distributions after specific time intervals. The computed widths of the beta-depletion zones showed satisfactory agreement with the measurements. Additionally, the model was able to predict the formation of a TCP-phase and its penetration into the substrate with increasing exposure time in one of the investigated coating systems.

AB Multilayered MCrAlY type coatings have the potential to be optimised to protect superalloy components against both corrosion and oxidation simultaneously. In this paper, a dual layered coating (NiCr(Co)AlY on top of a NiCoCrAlY coating) has been aged and the microstructural evolution has been observed and quantified using various electron microscopy based techniques. In addition, the microstructural evolution of the coating has been modelled using a diffusion based model capable of predicting the ageing of multilayer coatings. It is demonstrated that the model is reasonably accurate in predicting both the phase and chemical distributions through the coating system during ageing, and therefore has the potential to be used as a design tool for the improvement of future layered coating systems.

TI Development of Ni-based single crystal superalloys for power-generation

SO TETSU TO HAGANE-JOURNAL OF THE IRON AND STEEL INSTITUTE OF JAPAN
AB In advanced industrial gas-turbine systems, there has been a great demand for new single crystal (SC) superalloys with an excellent combination of high-temperature creep strength, hot-corrosion resistance and oxidation resistance. In this study, ten nickel-based SC superalloys were designed with the aid of the d-electrons concept. Their chemical compositions were in the range of 1.2-1.5% Ti, 3.8-6.5% Cr, 11% Co, 01.4% Mo, 6.5-7.4% Ta, 5.0-6.0% W, 3.6-5.4% Re, 5.1-5.5% Al, 0.12-0.14% Hf and balanced Ni in mass% units. A series of experiments such as creep rupture tests, burner rig tests and cyclic oxidation tests was conducted with the heat-treated SC specimens of these alloys. All the designed alloys were found to be superior in the creep rupture life to a second generation superalloy, CMSX-4. In the hot-corrosion resistance estimated from the burner rig tests, any designed alloys were comparable or even superior to CMSX-4. The oxidation resistance was very different amount the designed alloys, but some of them showed higher resistance than CMSX-4. Thus the SC alloys containing about 4-5 mass% Re had about 20 K higher temperature capability than CMSX-4, while exhibiting excellent hot-corrosion resistance and oxidation resistance.

The performance tests of duplex ZrO2-8 wt.%Y2O3/MCrAlY thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) were conducted at 1050-degrees-C, 1075-degrees-C, 1100-degrees-C, 1150-degrees-C and 1200-degrees-C. The results of the experiments in this study showed that TBC specimens with the aluminised MCrAlY bond coat exhibited higher cyclic lives (except for the Ni-22Cr-10Al-1Y bond coat), at all the temperatures tested, than specimens on which the bond coat was not aluminised. The microstructures of the Co-29Cr-6Al-1Y, Co-32Ni-21Cr-8Al-0.5Y and Ni-22Cr-1OAl-1Y bond coats with or without aluminising treatment were examined in detail using a scanning electron microscope equipped with an electron probe microanalyzer.

The experimental results showed that the deformation mechanism of K640S alloy is dislocation slip; that the dislocation could be decomposed into continuous stacking faults with different orientations; and that with the increase of the number of dislocations, the dislocation tangle interacts with the decomposed stacking fault to increase the tensile strength of the alloy. As the stretching proceeded further, a plurality of slip systems were activated between different grains to coordinate the deformation, and the grains were gradually plastically deformed. The stress concentration occurred at the carbide interfaces, and microcracks were formed, causing mixed crystal fracture to the alloy.

TI Improvement and micro-mechanism of a low expansion superalloy
SO RARE METALS
AB Chromium free low expansion superalloys Incoloy 900 series based on the system Fe-Ni-Co-Nb-Ti are precipitation-strengthen austenitic alloys with combination of very low thermal expansion coefficient and high tensile strength. The most important problem of these alloys is the susceptibility to stress accelerated grain boundary oxygen embrittlement (SAGBO) due to the absence of chromium. The oxidation resistance of the alloys after they were exposed for long time at high temperatures and the notch bar rupture strength have been improved with appropriate rare earth (RE) addition. With trace yttrium addition, the platelet precipitates become smaller and denser and the phase of precipitate transforms from epsilon phase to H phase. The crystal structures of the platelet phases in the conventional and Y-containing superalloys have been investigated and determined. The interface between the H phase and the matrix hits also been demonstrated.

TI Hot corrosion behavior of Co modified NiAl coating on nickel base
   superalloys
SO CORROSION SCIENCE
AB The microstructure and corrosion behavior was studied for a Co modified NiAl coating formed on the superalloy DZ125 by pack cementation process. The hot corrosion kinetics showed that the mass gain of the coated specimen was three orders of magnitude lower than that of the uncoated specimen at 1173 K up to 100 h. The corrosion product formed on the surface of the coating mainly consisted of a protective alpha-Al2O3 film. The presence of Co in the coating could promote the establishment of a protective Al2O3 scale on the coating and restrain the internal diffusion of sulphur in the coating. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB MCrA1Y alloys (where M stands for Ni,Co or both) are commonly used as overlay protective coatings in gas turbine engine components against high temperature oxidation and corrosion. The protective effect of these alloys is due to the formation of a continuous thermally stable oxide layer on the coating surface. In this work several types of MCrA1Y alloys, differing in their elemental composition, have been deposited on austenitic stainless steel by means of laser cladding. The microstructure of the coatings have been characterized by SEM-EDS and XRD. As expected, elemental composition compatible with gamma Ni/gamma' Ni3A1, gamma Ni/beta-NiAl or gamma Co/beta-(Co,Ni)A1 phases are observed in hypoeutectic or hypereutectic microstructures depending on the alloy composition. The high temperature oxidation behavior of the coatings was evaluated by air furnace oxidation tests at 1100 degrees C for 200 h. The oxidized surface of the samples was examined by SEM-EDS and the oxides present identified by theoretical stoichiometric calculations. Results indicate the formation of a uniform A1(3)O(2) protective oxide scale with NiO, CoO, Y2O3/YA1O(3) and Cr2O3 oxide inclusions.

TI EFFECT OF NOTCH ORIENTATION AND LOCAL RECRYSTALLIZATION ON THERMAL
   FATIGUE PROPERTIES OF A DIRECTIONALLY SOLIDIFIED Co-BASED SUPERALLOY
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB The directionally solidificated (DS) Co-based superalloys are widely used in aircraft turbine vanes due to the good stress-rupture parameters and excellent hot corrosion resistance. The cyclic change of temperatures and complex stress state thermal fatigue (TF) cracks happen frequently in vanes during service. However, most of the work are conducted in Ni-based superalloys and there is rare report concerning the TF behavior of DS Co-based superalloys. Furthermore, due to the residual strain accumulated during processing, shot peening, grinding and recrystallization (RX) frequently occur when the DS components are exposed to high temperatures. It is believed that RX may change the microstructure, especially adding more grain boundaries to DS alloys, and result in the reduction of the mechanical properties of DS superalloys. Therefore, in this work, V-notch plate specimens with notch direction perpendicular and parallel to the DS orientation are machined from the DS plate. Local RX grains are prepared (local indented and then heat treated) in the notch areas of some samples. TF test is conducted between 1000 degrees C to room temperature. The effect of DS orientation and RX on TF properties of a DS Co-based superalloy is investigated. The results indicate that the cracks propagate along the interdendritic regions in the samples with notches parallel to the DS direction, which exhibites lower TF properties than samples with notches vertical to the DS direction. TF cracks initiate and propagate along RX boundaries in samples containing RX grains. Precipitation of M23C6 carbides is found along the RX boundaries during TF tests. Due to the oxidation at the tip of crack, M23C6 desquamates and leads to the formation of micro voids, which accelerates the crack propagation and decreases TF properties of tested alloy. In samples with notches parallel to the DS direction, cracks preferentially propagate along the RX grain boundaries.

AB Cast NiCrAl alloys with additions of Y, La, Hf and Ti were evaluated at 1100 degrees C in wet (10 and 50% H2O) and dry air (0% H2O) in order to optimize such dopants for superalloy bond coatings. The results suggest that the typical Y addition in most coatings could be replaced by La. Also, scale adhesion in cyclic testing was improved with the co-addition of Hf with La or Y. Ti was added to investigate its incorporation in coatings on superalloys containing significant Ti additions. Particularly with co-doped alloys, the addition of Ti had little effect on scale adhesion but did reduce the depth of internal oxidation. Water vapor increased spallation, especially for the least adherent alloys, such as Y,Ti-doped NiCrAl. For the co-doped compositions with Hf, water vapor had a limited effect on scale adhesion and on the alumina growth rate in isothermal exposures. In addition to specimen mass change, the extent of internal oxidation and the depletion of beta phase in the substrate were evaluated. Analytical transmission electron microscopy showed that Y, La and Hf co-segregated to the alumina scale grain boundaries and formed dopant-rich oxide precipitates in the scale.

TI Grain Boundary Oxidation Effect of GH4738 Superalloy on Fatigue Crack
   Growth
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB The low cycle fatigue (LCF) experiments of nickel-based turbine disc alloy GH4738 have been carried out at different temperatures in air to investigate the influence of temperature on fatigue crack growth (FCG) behavior of GH4738 alloy. The FCG curves (da/dN-Delta K and a-N) and their regularity have been obtained. The results show that there is a sensitive range of temperature in which the fatigue life for GH4738 decreases sharply. The microstructures and fracture surface morphologies of the GH4738 samples tested at different temperatures were observed by FE-SEM, and changes of the mechanical properties of GH4738 at high temperature were also taken into account through modifying the stress intensity factor amplitude, Delta K. The interruption experiments were carried out at 700 degrees C and room temperature, respectively, to investigate the crack growth mode and oxidation degree at the crack tip and grain boundary of the samples. And the essential reason of temperature influence on FCG behavior of GH4738 was discussed. The result showed that as the temperature increases, the fatigue crack growth rate (FCGR) of GH4738 accelerates, the fracture surface tends to coarse, and the failure mode converts from a mixed transgranular and intergranular fracture to totally intergranular fracture. The fatigue crack growth lifetime decreases remarkably at 650 similar to 700 degrees C , existing a temperature-sensitive region under Delta K=40 MPa.m(1/2) and 30 similar to 40 mu m grain size conditions, which is mainly caused by the oxidation at elevated temperature, independent of the microstructure and mechanical property. Oxygen diffuses into the grain boundary through crack tip and slip band, or penetrates directly into the grain boundary, reacts with active elements (Co, Ti, Al) and generates brittle oxides. These brittle oxides result in weakening of grain boundary and significant decrease of fatigue property of GH4738.

TI Oxidation and Hot Corrosion Behavior of Plasma-Sprayed MCrAlY-Cr2O3
   Coatings
SO JOURNAL OF THERMAL SPRAY TECHNOLOGY
AB The oxidation and hot corrosion behavior of two atmospheric plasma-sprayed NiCoCrAlY-Cr2O3 and CoNiCrAlY-Cr2O3 coatings, which are primarily designed for wear applications at high temperature, were investigated in this study. The two coatings were exposed to air and molten salt (75%Na2SO4-25%NaCl) environment at 800 A degrees C under cyclic conditions. Oxidation and hot corrosion kinetic curves were obtained by thermogravimetric technique. X-ray diffraction analysis and scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive x-ray spectrometry were employed to characterize the coatings' microstructure, surface oxides, and composition. The results showed that both coatings provided the necessary oxidation resistance with oxidation rates of about 1.03 x 10(-2) and 1.36 x 10(-2) mg/cm(2) h, respectively. The excellent oxidation behavior of these two coatings is attributed to formation of protective (Ni,Co)Cr2O4 spinel on the surface, while as-deposited Cr2O3 in the coatings also acted as a barrier to diffusion of oxidative and corrosive substances. The greater presence of Co in the CoNiCrAlY-Cr2O3 coating restrained internal diffusion of sulfur and slowed down the coating's degradation. Thus, the CoNiCrAlY-Cr2O3 coating was found to be more protective than the NiCoCrAlY-Cr2O3 coating under hot corrosion condition.

TI Influence of oxidation on fatigue crack initiation and propagation in
   turbine disc alloy N18
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FATIGUE
AB Fatigue crack initiation and propagation behaviour in subsolvus heat treated turbine disc alloy N18 has been assessed in air and vacuum at 650 and 725 degrees C under three-point loading. Fatigue crack initiation processes have been evaluated using single edge U-notch specimens under a 1-1-1-1 trapezoidal loading waveform along with interrupted tests at 650 degrees C to allow intermittent observations of the notch surface. The results show apparent grain boundary (GB) oxidation can occur under an oxygen partial pressure of 10(-2)-10(-3) Pa. Cracks mainly initiate from grain boundaries or gamma/gamma' interfaces due to the formation and subsequent cracking of Cr-rich and/or Co-rich oxides, and occasionally initiate from surface pores. Fatigue life in these tests appears to be dominated by this crack initiation process and is significantly reduced by increasing temperature and/or application of an oxidizing environment. Crack growth tests conducted under 1-1-1-1 and 1-20-1-1 loading waveforms indicate that oxidation significantly degrades the crack growth resistance of N18 and is associated with more intergranular fracture surface features. Additional oxidation effects on propagation caused by higher temperature or prolonging dwell time appear limited, whereas a prolonged dwell period seems to instead promote additional creep process, which further enhance crack growth, especially at higher temperature.

TI Alumina formation and microstructural changes of aluminized CoNiCrAlY
   coating during high temperature exposure in the temperature range 925
   degrees C-1075 degrees C
SO MATERIALS AT HIGH TEMPERATURES
AB MCrAlY (M = Ni, Co) coatings are commonly used on gas-turbine components as oxidation resistant overlay coatings and bondcoats for thermal barrier systems. In the present work the microstructural features and oxidation behavior of an aluminized Co-base MCrAlY-coating on a Ni-based superalloy have been investigated in the temperature range 925-1075 degrees C. Microstructural studies of the oxidized coatings by SEM/EBSD were complemented with numerical thermodynamic calculations using the software package ThermoCalc. In the as-received condition the outer part of the coating consisted mostly of beta-(Ni,Co)Al. Formation of sigma-CoCr was observed at the interface between the beta-layer and the inner initial CoNiCrAlY. During high-temperature air exposure alumina based surface scales were formed but the oxidation induced Al depletion of the aluminized coating did not result in formation of the gamma'-(Ni3Al) phase. Rather, the subscale formation of Co/Cr-rich phases was observed and a direct transformation of beta- into gamma-Ni phase after longer times. It is expected that these subscale microstructural changes thus affect the alumina formation and growth as well as the critical aluminum depletion in a different manner as in the case of corresponding beta-NiAl coatings, although a direct comparison between various coating systems was not possible on the basis of the present results.

SO JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING FOR GAS TURBINES AND POWER-TRANSACTIONS OF THE
   ASME
CT 41st International Gas Turbine and Aeroengine Congress and Exhibition
CY JUN 10-13, 1996
CL BIRMINGHAM, ENGLAND
AB INCONEL(R) alloy 783 is art oxidation-resistant low coefficient of thermal expansion (low CTE) superalloy developed for gas turbine applications. Turbine efficiency can be increased through the use of low-CTE shrouds and case components that maintain tight blade tip clearances at different turbine operating temperatures. To achieve low CTE, alloys based on Ni-Fe-Co compositions require Cr content be maintained at low levels. Added Cr lowers the Curie temperature and thereby increases thermal expansion rate over a wider temperature range. The necessary lack of Cr minimizes resistance to both general oxidation and stress-accelerated grain boundary oxygen enhanced cracking (SAGBO). Increased amounts of Al in alloys strengthened by y' alone also promotes SAGBO. Alloy 783 is the culmination in the development of an alloy system with very high aluminum content that, in addition to forming y', causes beta aluminide phase precipitation in the austenitic matrix. It was discovered that this type of structure can be processed to resist both SAGBO and general oxidation, while providing low thermal expansion and useful mechanical properties up to 700 degrees C. The high Al content also reduces density to 5 percent below that of superalloys such as INCONEL alloy 718. Key aspects of the alloy development are presented, including the assessment of SAGBO resistance by evaluating elevated temperature crack growth in air The alloy, now commercially available, has been successfully fabricated and welded into gas turbine engine components.

TI Reversible catastrophic oxidation of a 38Fe-34Ni-25Cr alloy induced by
   sodium sulphate at low oxygen potential atmospheres
SO CORROSION SCIENCE
AB The chromia-forming nickel-based alloy Haynes (R) HR-120 was oxidised with and without Na2SO4 deposit in a CO/H-2/CO2 (45/45/10%vol.) simulated process atmosphere at 900 degrees C for 96 h. During the first hours of oxidation, samples covered by sodium sulphate exhibit higher oxidation rate than non-covered ones. However, after 24 h both sulphate-covered and uncovered specimens follow the same linear kinetics. In this very low oxygen partial pressure environment (10(-18) atm), the presence of Na2SO4 promotes the growth of localized iron-rich oxide nodules leading to the observed accelerated oxidation. The development of these nodules is discussed to be the result of the chromia dissolution induced by a basic fluxing mechanism. As soon as the salt is evaporated, slower kinetics are observed and the nodules disappear. In these specific conditions, the oxidation could be considered as a self-healing process.

TI Effects of process parameters of vacuum pre-oxidation on the
   microstructural evolution of CoCrAlY coating deposited by HVOF
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB The CoCrAlY coatings deposited using the high velocity oxygen fuel process (HVOF) onto the Inconel 718 superalloy were employed by three different vacuum pre-oxidation heat treatments, and subsequently, the specimens were subjected to isothermal oxidation exposure testing in air at 1050 degrees C for up to 100 h. The spinel oxides were found in the CoCrAlY coatings during the high velocity oxygen fuel process, and subsequently, after isothermal oxidation exposure in air, both the spinel and CoO oxides were formed in the TGO of the NVHT specimen. The evolution of both the phase transformation and the thermally grown oxides' (TGO) growth rate could be significantly influenced by adjusting certain process parameters of vacuum pre-oxidation heat treatments. The TGO of the VHT specimen was predominantly composed of theta-Al2O3 and alpha-Al2O3; however, Co(Cr, Al)(2)O-4 and alumina were observed in the TGO of the VHT950 and VHT1000 specimens. The theta-Al2O3 to alpha-Al2O3 phase transformation in the TGO of the VHT specimen could be delayed after isothermal oxidation exposure. The TGO growth rate was significantly suppressed after the vacuum pre-oxidation heat treatments, and the order of the TGO growth rate was as follows: NVHT<VHT950<VHT<VHT1000. The tensile stress at the alumina area of the TGO in the VHT and VHT950 specimens reduced considerably compared to that in the NVHT specimen, and finally, for the VHT1000 specimen, the tensile stress turned to compressive stress. The elemental interdiffusion behaviour between the HVOF-coating and nickel-based superalloy was characterized, and the diffusion activation energy of cobalt, aluminium and chromium were attempted to be estimated.

SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB This study focuses on investigating the microstructure and oxidation behavior of Al and Hf co-deposition diffusion coatings deposited by Pt electroplating followed by combined aluminizing and hafnizing using the pack cementation technique. The composition (in wt.%) of the packs was 2NiAl-2NH(4)Cl-xHf-(96 - x)Al2O3 with different Hf levels (x = 2, 6, 12 and 16), and the corresponding microstructure of the coatings was gamma-Ni + gamma'-Ni3Al, NiAl + Al16Hf6Ni7, Al16Hf6Ni7 and Al1.65HfNi0.35, respectively. In the post heat-treatment process, with Hf and Al diffusing towards the superalloy substrate and Ni diffusing in the opposite direction, Al16Hf6Ni7 and Al1.65HfNi0.35 were transformed into Ni3Al + Al3HfNi12 and NiAl + Al3HfNi12, respectively. The isothermal oxidation tests at 1000 degrees C in air indicated that the coating formed in the packs containing 2 wt.% Hf had the lowest weight gain, while the weight gain of the coating formed in the packs having 6 wt.% Hf was the largest. The mechanisms of Hf-rich phase formation and their effects on oxidation resistance of the coatings were discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A series of candidate alumina-forming austenitic (AFA) stainless steels designed to evaluate the effects of variation in Al, C, Cr, Mn, Nb, and Ni content on high-temperature tensile properties, creep, and oxidation/corrosion resistance were studied. The compositions assessed were based on medium Ni (20-25 wt%) and low Ni (12 wt%) AFA variations strengthened primarily by MC and/or M23C6 carbide precipitates, and a high Ni (32 wt%) AFA superalloy variation strengthened primarily by gamma '-Ni3Al intermetallic precipitates. Tensile and creep properties were measured at 650 and 750/760 degrees C, oxidation resistance from 650 to 900 C in air with water vapor and steam environments, and sulfidation-oxidation resistance in Ar-20%H-2-20%H-2(O)-5% H2S at 550 and 650 degrees C. Optimized composition ranges for different use temperatures ranges based on these evaluations are presented. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI HIGH TEMPERATURE OXIDATION BEHAVIOUR OF CoCrTaAlY+10%Al2O3 COATINGS
   PRODUCED BY HVOF
SO METALLURGIA ITALIANA
AB High temperature oxidation causes degradation of materials in aircraft engines. Typical coatings like MCrAlY (where M is Co, Ni or Fe) are used to prevent or retard oxidation. High Velocity Oxygen Fuel (HVOF) is a thermal spray technique used in this field.
   This work aims to characterize a reinforced CoCrTaAlY (+10% Al2O3) coating that has been thermally sprayed on CMSX-4 superalloy discs by HVOF. The samples were exposed at 1100 degrees C for long times (100-500 h) in air to develop oxidation. Interdiffusion processes were activated at high temperatures and microhardness values decreased as a function of time and distance from the surface. After 500h oxidation, hardness values in the coating were comparable to that in the matrix, with a 25% reduction compared to the pre-oxidized condition. At the same time, a strong aluminum oxide developed on the surface to protect the coating; the oxide was 5 pm thick after 96 h and higher than 12 pm after 50Ch. microstructure characterization was performed by light microscopy and SEM.

TI STUDY ON HOT CORROSION RESISTANCE OF A NEW DIRECTIONAL SOLIDIFICATION
   Ni-BASED SUPERALLOY
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB The hot corrosion resistance of a new directional solidification (DS) Ni-based super-alloy DZ68 was studied and compared with K438 alloy. The results indicate that the microstructure of DZ68 alloy is more uniform than K438 alloy after heat treatment. There are small size carbides in the microstructure of DZ68 alloy after heat treatment, but there are big size carbides and a lot (gamma + gamma') eutectic in the microstructure of K438 alloy. The hot corrosion of DZ68 alloy is uniform, and the corrosion products are mainly (Ni, Co)Cr2O4 and Al2O3, More (Ni, Co)Cr2O4 exists in outer corrosion layer and more Al2O3 exists in inner corrosion layer. For the K438 alloy the hot corrosion is not uniform, NiO is the mainly corrosion product in outer corrosion layer and CrS is the main corrosion product in inner corrosion layer, Moreover, the segregation of Ti can induce segregation of other elements in the two alloys, which leads to a severe local corrosion of alloys. Under the same experimental condition, the corrosion resistance of DZ68 alloy is a little better than that of K438 alloy.

TI Effect of Heat Treatment on the Microstructure and Properties of
   HVOF-Sprayed Co-Cr-W Coating
SO JOURNAL OF THERMAL SPRAY TECHNOLOGY
AB Co-Cr-W HVOF-sprayed protective coatings are used for their high oxidation and wear resistance. Apart from the oxidation resistance, the stability of their mechanical properties in relation to thermal loading is crucial with respect to the most common high-temperature application areas. This work is focused mainly on evaluation of the heat-induced changes in the phase composition and related mechanical properties. It was shown that the original powder, composed fully from face-centered cubic Co-based alloy, partly changes its phase composition during spraying to a hexagonal close-packed (hcp) structure. The annealing further increases the ratio of the hcp phase in the structure. The heat-induced phase changes are accompanied by an increase in the coatings' hardness and cohesion strength. The abrasive and adhesive wear behavior was evaluated. While the coatings' heat treatment had a positive effect on the coefficient of friction, the abrasive and adhesive wear resistance of annealed coating was lower compared to as-sprayed coating.

TI Simulating the effect of aluminizing on a CoNiCrAlY-coated Ni-base
   superalloy
SO CALPHAD-COMPUTER COUPLING OF PHASE DIAGRAMS AND THERMOCHEMISTRY
AB MCrAlY (M = Ni, Co) coatings are commonly used on gas-turbine components as oxidation resistant overlay coatings and bondcoats for thermal barrier systems. The present work focuses on the effect of the aluminizing process on the CoNiCrAIY coating microstructure. In the as-received condition the outer part of the coating consisted mostly of beta-(Ni,Co)AI with interspersed precipitates of Cr-rich carbide and Cr-rich boride precipitates. Formation of sigma-CoCr was observed at the interface between the beta-layer and the inner initial CoNiCrAlY microstructure. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) combined with energy and wavelength-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX/WDX) was employed to characterize the aluminized CoNiCrAIY coating. Phases were then identified by electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD). Detailed microstructural studies of the coating were corroborated with the help of coupled thermodynamic-kinetic calculations to model the aluminizing process. The calculations were performed with the in-house developed code employing the commercially available thermodynamic and kinetic databases (ThermoCalc). The mechanisms of the observed microstructural changes were elucidated with the help of the modelling results.

AB With the goal of investigating the reported detrimental effect of water vapor on thermal barrier coating (TBC) performance, furnace cycle experiments were conducted in dry O-2 and air with 10 and 50% water vapor at 1100 degrees C. The TBC systems evaluated were air plasma-sprayed (APS), yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) top coatings with high velocity oxy fuel (HVOF)-deposited NiCoCrAlY or NiCoCrAlYHfSi bond coating. Average TBC lifetime was reduced by 30% in air with 10% water vapor compared to cycling in dry O-2, using 1 h cycle durations. Superalloy substrates with Y and La additions also were investigated but showed no statistical change in the average TBC lifetime compared to the base CMSX4 superalloy. In all cases, the bond coating with Hf and Si additions increased YSZ lifetime by 20% or more. Experiments that increased water vapor to 50% showed no further decrease in TBC lifetime. Increasing the cycle frequency to 100 h resulted in a large increase in TBC lifetime, especially for the NiCoCrAlYHfSi bond coatings. Co-doping the NiCoCrAl bond coat with Y and Hf was beneficial to TBC lifetime, but did not mitigate the detrimental impact of water vapor. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SO OXIDATION OF METALS
CT 4th International Symposium on High-Temperature Oxidation and Corrosion
   (ISHOC)
CY JUL 23-27, 2014
CL Hakodate, JAPAN
AB A multilayer coating, which consisted of a Cr-Si co-deposited layer as the diffusion barrier, a plasma sprayed NiCrAlY middle layer, and an aluminized top layer, was developed. During the aluminizing treatment, Cr in the NiCrAlY layer was released as the gamma/gamma' structure of this layer transformed to the beta phase. The released Cr was inhibited by the inner Cr-Si layer to diffuse into the substrate, and a Cr layer eventually formed over the Cr-Si layer. The Cr layer impeded the inward diffusion of Al due to the low solubility of Al in the Cr layer so that more Al atoms remain in the coating and contributed to the oxidation resistance of the coating. The multilayer coating exhibited better oxidation and spallation resistance than coatings without a Cr-Si layer, at least at 1050 A degrees C for up to 1000 h.

TI Influences of Cr and Co on the Growth of Thermally Grown Oxide in
   Thermal Barrier Coating during High-Temperature Exposure
SO COATINGS
AB Thermal barrier coating (TBC) is a critical material in the aerospace domain to increase the lifetime of gas turbine components subjected to thermal load. The properties of TBC are strongly related to the growth of thermally grown oxide (TGO) whose main constituent is Al2O3. However, the oxidation of Cr and Co can affect the growth of TGO, which is not studied sufficiently. In this paper, high-temperature exposure at 1000 degrees C was performed to investigate the effect of Cr and Co oxides on TGO growth. The morphology and composition analysis of the interface between the ceramic top coat and the bond coat (TC/BC) were investigated by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and the energy dispersion spectrum (EDS). The thermodynamics and kinetics of oxidation were analyzed. The results indicated that the oxidation kinetics basically followed the sub-parabolic law with exposure time. Additionally, the major factor affecting the formation of oxides was the diffusion rate at the initial stage of exposure, then oxides depended on thermodynamics, and the oxidation was influenced by both of them in the last stage. The major elements to be oxidized were different at different stages. Moreover, the replacement reaction of Cr2O3 and the phase conversion of Al2O3 resulted in thickness variations of the TGO and Al-depleted zone during high-temperature exposure.

SO CORROSION ENGINEERING SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The oxidation tests of the Nimonic 263 alloy exposed to deaerated supercritical water at 600-700 degrees C under 25 MPa were carried out for up to 1000 h. Oxidation rate increased with an increase in temperature. The microstructure and phase composition of oxide scale were analysed by scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. It can be seen that a complex oxide structure formed on the surface of Nimonic 263 including an outer layer of Ni-Fe/Ni-Cr spinel oxide, Ni/Co hydroxide and TiO2 and an inner layer of a mixture of NiCr2O4 and Cr2O3 while the innermost layer is made up of Cr2O3. The MoO3 can be observed at 600 degrees C but disappeared with the increasing temperature. The growth mechanism of oxide scale was discussed.

AB The effect of two base alloys, viz. Ni-based superalloy Rene 80 and Co-based alloy ECY768, on the oxidation and interdiffusion behavior of a NiCoCrAlY Re-containing coating after exposure for up to 2000 h at 1050A degrees C in synthetic air has been evaluated. Scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy was employed to measure the element concentrations, and phases were identified by electron backscatter diffraction. Significant depletion of beta-NiAl within the coating, enrichment of gamma'-phase, and formation of A mu-phase in the alloy and Kirkendall porosity at the coating-alloy interface were observed in the coating on Rene 80. In contrast, the coating on the Co-base alloy ECY768 formed large amounts of Cr/Re-rich carbides and the depletion of beta-NiAl phase was less pronounced than that observed on the Ni-base alloy. These findings could be interpreted using an in-house-developed thermodynamic-kinetic CALPHAD-based computer model.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY
AB Inconel 718 is widely used in sophisticated engineering applications due to its unique properties such as high oxidation resistance and corrosion resistance even at high temperatures and retains a mechanical strength under these conditions as well. But machining such an exotic material is costly due to the rapid tool wear. An attempt has been made to improve the performance of cemented tungsten carbide (WC-Co, K20) tool through various posttreatments namely cryogenic treatment and controlled heating and oil quenching. The treated tools were evaluated for their properties through microhardness and X-ray diffraction technique (XRD). The treated tools were subjected to machining (turning) of difficult-to-cut material, i.e., superalloy Inconel 718 to check their performance enhancement. Results showed that post-treated tools performed better while machining (turning) of superalloy Inconel 718 indicating that selected posttreatments can be potential posttreatment methods for improving machining ability of cemented tungsten carbide tools.

TI Hot corrosion of the Ni-20%Cr alloy and waspaloy immersed in Na2SO4
SO TETSU TO HAGANE-JOURNAL OF THE IRON AND STEEL INSTITUTE OF JAPAN
AB The nickel-based superalloy of Waspaloy and the Ni-20%Cr alloy were hot-corroded in the molten NaZSO(4) under the flowing air for up to 720 ks at 1273 to 1473K to clarify the sulfidation/oxidation behavior by means of XRD, OM, SEM, EPMA and TEM. They formed a subscale which was composed of intergranular and intragranular compounds in the alloy interior together with an external scale on the alloy. The kinetic of the subscale formations was followed by a parabolic rate law. The external scale and subscale formed on the Ni-20%Cr alloy consisted of CrzO(3) and CrzS(3), Cr;S-6 and a small amount of Cr2O3, respectively. Those formed on Waspaloy consisted of (Cr - Co Ti)(2)O-3 and TiS-, Cr2S3, Cr3S6, AlO3 and (Cr - Co - Ti)zO(3), respectively. In order to observe directly the three dimensional morphology of the subscale, a metal matrix was dissolved using an organic solution that does not dissolve the metallic sulfides or oxides which constitute the subscale. The organic solution developed in this investigation consisted of bromine, cetylpyridinium bromide and acetonitrile. The SEM images of the three-dimensional subscale extracted from the corroded alloys with the organic solution showed that the intergranular compounds formed thin walls of sulfides and oxides along grain boundaries and an intragranular sulfide formed isolated needles in the alloy grain interior near the external scale.

Cr has been added to provide oxidation resistance and Ni has then been added to widen and stabilise the gamma' phase field. The alloy presented has a solvus of 1010 degrees C and a density of 8.7 g cm(-3). The room temperature flow stress is over 1000 MPa and this reduces dramatically above 800 degrees C. The flow stress anomaly is observed. A microstructure with both similar to 50 nm gamma ' produced on cooling and larger 100-200 nm gamma ' can be obtained. Isothermal oxidation at 800 degrees C in air for 200 h gave a mass gain of 0.96 mg cm(-2). After hot deformation in the 650-850 degrees C temperature range, both anti phase boundaries (APBs) and stacking faults could be observed. An APB energy of 71 mJm(-2) was measured, which is comparable to that found in commercial nickel superalloys.

SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB The recently-discovered metastable gamma'-Co-3(Ta0.76V0.24) phase formed on aging in a Co-6Ta-6V (at.%) ternary alloy is stabilized by partial replacement of Ta and V with Al and Ti. In two alloys with composition Co-6Al-3Ta-3V and Co-5Al-3Ta-3V-1Ti with gamma+gamma' microstructure, the gamma'-precipitates remain stable for up to 168 h at 850 and 900 C, with no precipitation of additional phases. Adding Ni and B and doubling the Ti concentration produces a gamma/gamma' superalloy, Co-10Ni-5Al-3Ta-3V-2Ti-0.04B (at.%), with gamma' precipitates which are stable up to six weeks of aging at 850 degrees C, while slowly coarsening and coalescing from cuboidal to elongated shapes. After one day of aging at 850 degrees C, the gamma' nanoprecipitates have a (Co0.83Ni0.17)(3)(Ta0.42Al0.23Ti0.19V0.15B0.01) composition, with Al and Ti replacing at the same rate both Ta and V in the original metastable Co-3(Ta0.76V0.24) phase. To improve oxidation resistance, 4% Cr is added to the new superalloy, resulting in a somewhat higher volume fraction of finer cuboidal gamma' precipitates after one week of aging at 850 degrees C, but no other deleterious phases. These W-and Mo-free gamma/gamma' superalloys show good creep resistance at 850 degrees C, on par with two other recent Co-base gamma/gamma' superalloys: (i) Co-9W-9Al-8Cr (at.%) which has higher density due to its high W content, and (ii) Co-30Ni-10Al-5Mo-2Nb (at.%) which has lower density (as it is W-free) but contains triple the Ni concentration.

AB To improve the oxidation/corrosion resistance of MCrAlY coatings (M for Ni and/or Co), elements like Y; Si and Ta have been added into the coatings in past decades. In this study the oxidation performance of a Ni-based MCrAlY coating with small proportion of Ru, Mo and/or Jr were investigated after high-temperature exposure. The oxidation tests were carried out at 900 degrees C, 1000 degrees C or 1100 degrees C. The microstructure study showed that the addition of Ru, Mo and/or Jr had significant influence on the oxidation behavior at the coating surface and the microstructural evolution in the material. The microstructural evolution was quantitatively evaluated by measuring the phase degradation of beta-NiAl in the coating and gamma'-Ni3Al in the substrate of superalloy. Since no oxides of Ru, Mo and Jr were found on the coating surface, it was believed that the effects by those elements were mainly due to their dissolution in the metallic phases in the coatings.

AB Laser-aided direct metal deposition (LADMD) technique was used to fabricate Co-285+WC coatings on 1018 mild steels. The effects of the processing parameters (laser power P, addition amount of WC, scanning speed V) on the microhardness of the deposited coatings was analyzed. Results indicate that the microhardness of the matrix and the Rockwell hardness of the deposited coatings increases with the addition of WC and the P/V value. The addition amount of WC has the most important effect on the two hardness values, followed by the scanning speed and the laser power. Results of the optimized specimen in this study indicate that the deposited coating is composed of undissolved WC, dendrites, eutectics and the coral structures. The wear mechanism of the deposited coating is a mixture of abrasive, adhesive and oxidation wear.

TI Analysis of service condition of large hot forging die and refabrication
   of die by bimetal-layer weld surfacing technology with a cobalt-based
   superalloy and a ferrous alloy
SO JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING PROCESSES
AB Large forming load at high temperature causes the occurrences of plastic deformation, wear, mechanical fatigue, and thermal fatigue in the large hot forging dies and resulted in their short service lives. In this study, temperature field, stress field, and wear condition of large hot forging die were predicted and evaluated by finite element modelling (FEM) analysis. Corroborated by the experimental results, analysis results demonstrated that failures mainly occurred in bridge, boss, and groove regions of the large hot forging dies. According to the analysis and experimental results, the failed large hot forging dies were refabricated by bimetal-layer weld surfacing technology with a cobalt-based superalloy (Co03) and a ferrous alloy (JXHC15). No failure was observed on these refabricated dies, after production of 25 pieces. In comparison with the conventional fabrication or prefabrication methods, this bimetal-layer weld surfacing technology reduced the fabrication cost, shortened the fabrication cycle, and elongated the service lives of large hot forging die effectively.

AB in this study, the Hastelloy-X superalloy samples were firstly overlaid by a CoNiCrAlY bond coating utilizing a high pressure, high velocity oxygen fuel (HVOF) spray process. Then platinum thin film approx. 7.5 mu m thick was introduced to selected test samples of CoNiCrAlY coatings by a magnetron sputtering deposition process. Then the HVOF sprayed superalloy coupons, with and without Pt coating were pack aluminized for 4 h at 850 degrees C to produce (Co,Ni)Al and PtAl2 aluminide phases on their surfaces, respectively. All specimens were subjected to a thermal cycling test at 1100 degrees C. Then the aluminizing and Pt-aluminizing effects relative to cyclical oxidation behavior and microstructure evolutions of the coatings were evaluated. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffractometry (XRD) and electron probe microanalyzer (EPMA) were used to identify crystalline phases and microstructures of each coating. Results clearly indicated that the surface roughness of the HVOF sprayed CoNiCrAlY coatings were unchanged after aluminizing or the Pt-aluminizing process. The oxide scales spalled after 50 h and 100 h cyclic oxidation for the HVOF sprayed sample and aluminized sample respectively, while the oxide scale attached successfully to the substrate for the Pt-aluminized sample after testing for 150 h. It is obvious that the Pt-aluminizing process significantly improves the oxidation resistance of HVOF sprayed coatings, while the isolated aluminizing process demonstrated negligible effect.

TI Microstructure evolution of cobalt aluminide coating on nickel-based
   superalloys during exposure at 1050 degrees C
SO VACUUM
AB Cobalt aluminide coating was deposited onto two directionally solidified Ni-based superalloys (DZ 466 and DS GTD111) by low-pressure chemical vapor deposition. Interdiffusion behaviors of the two coating/superalloy systems were examined during long-term thermal exposure at 1050 degrees C. It was observed that the inward diffusion of Al and Co from the coating to the substrate and the outward diffusion of Ni and refractory elements such as W, Ta and Cr etc. from the substrate occurred during annealing. This phenomenon induced the degradation of coating matrix and several precipitations of chromium containing phases. Degradation rate and precipitate categories are of great differences for the two studied superalloys. The initial precipitates presented in the coating system had a morphological heredity-effect (MHE) to the final Upsilon phase microstructure. Mechanism referred to elements distribution was discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Blades and vanes made from Ni - and Co - base superalloys that are used in the hot section of all gas turbine engines are coated to enhance resistance to hot corrosion. The most widely used coatings are those based on the intermetallic compounds NiAl and CoAl, which are formed by diffusion interaction of aluminium with surfaces of the nickel and cobalt alloys, respectively. Simple aluminide coatings resist high - temperature oxidation by the formation of protective layer of alumina and can be used up to about 1 150 degrees C. The coatings degrade by loss of aluminium due to spalling of oxides under thermal cycling conditions. HPT blades of DV - 2 jet engines are made from Ni - based superalloy ZS6K. For improving alloy's high temperature resistance are blades coated with Al - Si diffusion layer. Depending on jet engine flying regime an overcrossing of working temperature may occur. It may result into coarsening of the gamma prime particles, thus decreasing its strengthening effect. A real case study of DV-2 jet engine turbine blades after high temperature exposition is discussed in this article. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Thermomechanical Fatigue Damage Evolution in a Superalloy/Thermal
   Barrier System Containing a Circular Through Hole
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CERAMIC SOCIETY
AB The results of an investigation of thermomechanical fatigue (TMF) on a superalloy specimen, with an applied thermal barrier coating (TBC) and a circular through hole, are presented. Tensile loads were applied in phase with increasing temperature. Damage evolution in the form of cracks develops in the TBC adjacent to the hole. These cracks run perpendicular to the loading axis. Stress mapping of the thermally grown oxide (TGO) using luminescence spectroscopy determined an increase in compressive residual stress with increasing TMF cycling. Scanning electron microscopy examination, following cross sectioning, determined the TBC cracks to be vertical separations of the columnar yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) top coat. Microscopic damage mechanisms in the form of plasticity (bending of YSZ columns) and TGO cracking were observed. Imperfections in the bond coat are associated with these vertical separations. Energy-dispersive element mapping of these imperfections indicated a composition of alumina and mixed Cr, Co, and Ni oxides.

TI Phase structure, morphology evolution and protective behaviors of

SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB A chemical vapor deposited (CVD) aluminizing process had been employed to deposit platinum modified aluminide coatings on the nickel-based single-crystal superalloys. The kinetics behavior, phase evolution, microstructure and chemical composition of the (Ni, Pt)Al coatings after oxidation and hot corrosion tests were studied in detail. After isothermal oxidation test, a protective alpha-Al2O3 scale is formed on the coating surface and, two new phases of (Ni, Pt)(3)Al-4 and gamma'-(Ni, Pt)(3)Al due to phase transformation reactions occur in the aluminide layer. The inward diffusion of Al element toward the substrate and, formation of micro-pores in the interface of aluminide layer and interdiffusion zone are probably the main degradation modes of the coating. Corrosive medium including of mixed of aviation fuels and artificial seawater has not serious deterioration of the coating after hot corrosion and furthermore a network of grain boundary ridges is still co-existed on the coating surface, although large of micro-pores and some of grain boundaries are appeared within the aluminide layer.

TI Microstructure characterization of Co-20Cr-(5,10)Al oxide dispersion
   strengthened superalloys
SO MATERIALS CHARACTERIZATION
AB In order to develop Co-based oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) superalloys with excellent mechanical properties and oxidation resistance at the temperature above 1000 degrees C, Co-20Cr-(5,10)Al ODS superalloys were designed and fabricated by mechanical alloying (MA), spark plasma sintering (SPS), hot rolling and the final annealing at 1200 degrees C. Two different phases were identified; the Co solid solution of a fcc structure, and the B2 phase highly enriched with Aluminum. Composition and volume fraction of both phases are almost consistent with the Co-Cr-Al ternary phase diagram computed with the Pandat software. Another coarse fcc phase with smaller content of oxide particles was also characterized. This phase was probably formed through an incipient melting at the initial stage of SPS process. Fine oxides particles are densely distributed inside both, the fcc solid solution and the B2 phase. Grain boundaries and phase boundaries are decorated with the oxide particles, which are beneficial to grains and phases stability at elevated temperature. The observed unique core-shell structure was characterized as Y2Hf7O17 type in a core and Y2Hf2O7 type at a periphery of the oxide particles. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

SO CALPHAD-COMPUTER COUPLING OF PHASE DIAGRAMS AND THERMOCHEMISTRY
AB A database for cobalt-base superalloys was built up by combing the binary and ternary thermodynamic descriptions available in the SSOL (SGTE) database and from the literature. Using this database, results of thermodynamic calculations for several cobalt-base superalloys were compared to the experimentally observed n-microstructure of the alloys after homogenization at high temperatures and quenching. Three examples are presented: prediction of phase equilibria versus temperature and composition; selection of highly refractory materials using isothermal sections; and evaluation of local melting temperature in the case of skin formation of Co-base alloy during air oxidation at 1300 degreesC.

TI Influence of Aluminum and Rhenium on the Isothermal Oxidation Behavior
   of CoNiCrAlY Alloys
SO OXIDATION OF METALS
AB The oxidation behavior of a Co32Ni21Cr8Al0.6Y (wt%) alloy with and without the addition of 3.5 wt% rhenium, 2 wt% aluminum or a combination of the two was investigated at 1000 A degrees C. Results showed that increasing the Al content from 8 to 10 wt% led to an increase of the alloy beta-phase, but did not affect the oxidation behavior. Re addition induced (Cr,Re,Y)-rich phase to precipitate in the alloy, accelerated the theta- to alpha-alumina transformation, reduced the oxidation rate and enhanced the rate of alloy Al diffusion. Adding both Al and Re further improved the oxidation behavior by promoting the development of the external alumina scale and suppressing the formation of Ni, Co containing spinel. This alloy also showed the largest reduction of oxidation rate and emerged to be the most beneficial. A continuous Cr-Re rich layer was observed at the oxide/alloy interface of the Re, Al containing alloy after longer oxidation times, but this layer is not expected to affect the continued growth of the alumina scale.

AB To take advantage of the synergistic effects of Pt and Zr, a kind of Zr-doped, Pt-modified aluminide coating has been prepared by a hybrid process, first electroplating a Pt layer and then co-depositing Zr and Al elements by an above-the-pack process. The microstructure and isothermal oxidation behavior of the coating has been studied, using a Pt-modified aluminide coating as a reference. Results showed that the Zr-doped, Pt-modified aluminide coating was primarily composed of beta-(Ni,Pt)Al phase, with small amounts of PtAl2- and Zr-rich phases dispersed in it. The addition of Zr diminished voids on the coating surface since Zr could hinder the growth of beta-NiAl grains. It also helped to increase the spalling resistance of the oxide scale and reduce the oxidation rate, which made the Zr-doped, Pt-modified aluminide coating possess better oxidation resistance than the reference Pt-modified aluminide coating at the temperature of 1100 degrees C.

TI AIR-ENVIRONMENT - CREEP INTERACTION IN A NICKEL-BASE SUPERALLOY
SO ENGINEERING FAILURE ANALYSIS
AB A Nimonic 263 alloy, widely used for combustion chamber applications in aeroengines, was exposed to air at 1020 degrees C to study the oxidation-creep interaction at 780 degrees C in the stress range of 160-275 MPa. Prior exposure of the alloy led to degradation of creep properties, resulting in enhanced creep rate, poor rupture lifetime and creep ductility embrittlement. Degradation of creep properties in the air-exposed alloy has been discussed in terms of oxygen-induced damage in the grain boundary due to the formation of CO gas bubbles and the depletion of gamma' in the near-surface region.

SO OXIDATION OF METALS
AB Experimental results are reported on the chemical and microstructural evolutions of a (NiPt)Al coating, deposited on a single-crystal, nickel-base superalloy, during isothermal-oxidation tests at 1100 degrees C, up to 50 hr. Analytical STEM studies were carried out, in conjunction with Auger experiments, in order to follow the various changes that occur in the bondcoat (beta into gamma' phase transformation, TCP and alpha-Cr precipitation, S-diffusion pathways) and at the Al2O3/bondcoat interface. Efforts were concentrated on the effect of interfacial sulfur segregation (at both intact interfaces and void surfaces) as a function of the oxidation time and its dependence on phase transformations in the external layer of the bondcoat. An important result concerning the co-segregation of S and Cr at the alumina/bondcoat interface was realized in this system due to Cr diffusion from the substrate into the bondcoat. This S segregation adversely affected Al2O3-bondcoat adhesion where extensive interfacial voids formed at the interface.

TI Isothermal Oxidation of Aluminized Coatings on High-Entropy Alloys
SO ENTROPY
AB The isothermal oxidation resistance of Al0.2Co1.5CrFeNi1.5Ti0.3 high-entropy alloy is analyzed and the microstructural evolution of the oxide layer is studied. The limited aluminum, about 3.6 at %, leads to the non-continuous alumina. The present alloy is insufficient for severe circumstances only due to chromium oxide that is 10 mu m after 1173 K for 360 h. Thus, the aluminized high-entropy alloys (HEAs) are further prepared by the industrial packing cementation process at 1273 K and 1323 K. The aluminizing coating is 50 mu m at 1273 K after 5 h. The coating growth is controlled by the diffusion of aluminum. The interdiffusion zone reveals two regions that are the Ti-, Co-, Ni-rich area and the Fe-, Cr-rich area. The oxidation resistance of aluminizing HEA improves outstandingly, and sustains at 1173 K and 1273 K for 441 h without any spallation. The alumina at the surface and the stable interface contribute to the performance of this Al0.2Co1.5CrFeNi1.5Ti0.3 alloy.

TI Effect of microstructure on early oxidation of MCrAlY coatings
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB Two MCrAlY coatings with the same nominal composition, but different microstructures are deposited onto Hastelloy (R) X superalloy substrates by low-pressure plasma spraying (LPPS) and high velocity oxygen fuel (HVOF) spraying, respectively. The early oxidation behaviour of the coatings at 1150 degrees C is studied. For the LPPS coating with relative coarse grains, the gamma and beta-phase show different oxidation behaviours: the oxide on the gamma-phase shows a multi-layer structure, consisting of outer (Ni,Co) (Cr,Al)(2)O-4, intermediate (Cr,Al)(2)O-3 and inner alpha-Al2O3; the oxidation of the beta-phase, however, is characterised by selective oxidation of aluminium and the oxide is composed of a mixture of theta and alpha-Al2O3. a For the nanocrystalline HVOF coating, it does not show site-specific oxidation and the oxidation is characterised by formation of an exclusive alpha-Al2O3 scale over the surface. The microstructure-dependent oxidation is quantitatively described from the perspective of oxidation kinetics, with contribution from both lattice and grain boundary diffusion taken into consideration. A critical grain size of the gamma-phase, below which formation of an exclusive Al2O3 scale can be achieved, is predicted and verified. The study gives new insights into oxidation of MCrAlY coatings.

TI Microstructural Observations on Oxidized Ni-Based Superalloy TMS-75 and
   PGM-Doped Derivatives
SO JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB The isothermal oxidation behavior of experimental third and fourth generation Ni-based superalloys was studied at temperatures between 900 and 1100 degrees C. It was found that the lower Cr concentration in third and fourth generation alloys compared to second generation alloys negatively affects the ability of the alloy to form and maintain a protective alumina scale especially at lower temperatures (900 degrees C). An extensive internal reaction zone comprised of oxide and nitride phases is observed underneath a nonprotective external oxide scale. At higher temperatures, a continuous alumina scale forms underneath (Ni,Co)O and spinel layers. Due to the low level of reactive element (RE) additions in these experimental alloys, scale adhesion is poor. An increase of Cr content is necessary to ensure formation of a protective alumina scale at lower temperatures. Addition of Y and/or Zr is recommended for improved oxide adhesion, resulting in better overall oxidation performance. (C) 2010 The Electrochemical Society.

AB The hot components of gas turbine are loaded by high stresses in presence of high-temperature oxidation and hot corrosion environment during service process. It is important to simulate the interaction of stress and hot corrosion on the components in real service situation. Effect of the ratios of salt mixtures of Na2SO4/NaCl and the coating amounts of salt mixtures on the microstructure and the high temperature stress-rupture properties of a corrosion resistant directionally solidified superalloy at 850 degrees C/500MT'a were investigated. The results demonstrated that the stress-rupture life decreased with the coated salt mixture ratio of Na2SO4/NaCl changing from 3:1 to 9:1. Stress-rupture lives of the alloy decreased from 63 h to 42 h, while the coated salt mixtures amount increased from 1 mg/cm(2) to 4 mg/cm(2), hereby the salt mixture contained 75% Na2SO4 and 25% NaCl. When the coating ratio of Na2SO4/NaCl was 9:1, the stratified corrosion products layers were composed of the (Ni, Co)O, Ni(Al, Cr)(2)O-4 layer, bright grey phase that be identified as CrWO4, and the underlying dispersed particle shape phase CrSx, the underlying layer forms the sulfides eutectic and leads to catastrophic destruction for the alloy, which decreased the stress-rupture lives dramatically.

TI Pre-oxidation of Inconel alloys for inhibition of carbon deposition from
   heated jet fuel
SO OXIDATION OF METALS
AB Exposure of superalloy surfaces to jet fuel at elevated temperatures leads to the formation of carbonaceous deposits and metal sulfides. The formation of stable oxide layers on alloy surfaces can reduce the activity of the constituent transition metals that catalyze the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons and the subsequent carbon deposit growth. The metals Ni, Cr, Fe, Mn, Al, Ti and Nb + Ta form thermodynamically stable oxide layers after oxidation above 800 degrees C under O-2 flow. In this study, we investigated the formation of oxides and spinels on three different Ni-base superalloys (Inconel 600, Inconel 718, and Inconel X750) and their activity towards carbon and sulfur deposit formation from jet fuel (JP-8) thermal stressing at 600 degrees C and 34 atm (500 psig) for 5 hr. Metal oxide formation during pre-oxidation and the behavior of pre-oxidized samples in thermal stressing were found to depend strongly on the minor element composition of these superalloys.

AB The isothermal oxidation behavior at 900 and 1100 degrees C in pure oxygen of several commercial single-crystal Ni-base superalloys (CMSX2, CMSX4, CMSX6, AM3, MC2, SRR99) and modified versions of some of them has been investigated. Oxide scales formed at 900 degrees C are adherent and reveal the dendritic microstructure of the subjacent alloy. These scales are composed of three layers 1- (Ti,Co,Ni)-rich oxides, 2- Cr-rich oxides and 3- (Ta,W,Ti)-rich oxides. Al-internal oxidation zone and y' depleted zone are identified. Oxide scales formed at 1100 degrees C are not adherent and spall off extensively regardless of cooling rate. The critical temperature drop to initiate spallation (Delta T) depends on the oxide layer thickness (xi) and the interfacial rupture energy (y(F)). For a given oxide/metal couple (Delta T)(2) xi/y(F), is constant (EVANS and LOBB model). AM3 and CMSX4 alloys follow this model while AM3 and MC2 modified alloys have different behavior. Addition of Si and Hf and substitution of Mo by Re or Pt and Ti by Ta improve oxidation resistance at 900 degrees C and scale adherence at 1100 degrees C.

SO JOURNAL OF NANOMATERIALS
AB A thermal sprayed CoCrAlY coating was prepared by air plasma spray on the surface of Ni-based superalloy GH4169; then, a nanoscale aluminum film was deposited with electron beam vacuum deposition on it. The coatings irradiated by high-current pulsed electron beam were investigated. After HCPEB treatment, the Al film was remelted into the bond coat. XRD result shows that Al and Al2O3 phase were recorded in the irradiated and aluminized coatings, while Co-based oxides which originally existed in the initial samples disappeared. Microstructure observations reveal that the original coating with porosity, cavities, and inclusions was significantly changed after HCPEB treatment as compact appearance of interconnected bulged nodules. Moreover, the grains on the irradiated coating were very refined and homogeneously dispersed on the surface, which could effectively inhibit the corrosive gases and improve the coating oxidation resistance.

TI On the role of processing parameters in sintered new Co-based (W,Al)
   alloys
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB The demand for enhanced material performance and efficiency in high-temperature applications has motivated the development of novel Co-based superalloys. Co-Al-W-based superalloys with the gamma/gamma' structure have suitable properties for use at high temperature and are good candidates for replacing Ni-based superalloys in some applications. The current generation of Co-Al-W-based alloys has superior wear, corrosion, and oxidation resistance. The poor precipitation strengthening of these alloys compared to that of Ni-based superalloys can be overcome by designing the alloying system to promote gamma'-Co-3(Al, W) precipitation. In this work, the compositions of the selected Co-Al-W-based alloys were chosen because they improve the precipitation strengthening of the alloys. Starting from powders, the materials were fabricated by mechanical alloying (MA) and subsequently consolidated by field assisted hot pressing (FAHP). The prepared Co-Al-W superalloys have a large amount of well-dispersed nanoprecipitates in their microstructures and have nearly full density. The effects of the MA and consolidation process (FAHP) conditions on the microstructures and mechanical properties of selected samples are determined by comparing the samples. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

SO METALLOGRAPHY MICROSTRUCTURE AND ANALYSIS
AB Superalloys are widely used for high-temperature applications. But these alloys also suffered from severe degradation where corrosion problem frequently encountered due to the presence of molten salt deposits. To obviate this problem, three nickel-and cobalt-based superalloys had been exposed to (Na2SO4-25% NaCl) at 900 degrees C for 100 cycles. The resulting corrosion products were characterized using scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy. It was observed that both Ni-based alloys exhibited improved corrosion resistance over the Co-based alloy in this aggressive environment. In Ni-based alloys, the scale contained oxides such as NiO, Cr2O3, Fe2O3, and spinel NiCr2O4, whereas in case of Co-based alloy, the scale contained CoO and CoNiO2.

TI Comparison of oxidation resistance of NiCoCrAlTaY-coated and -uncoated
   Mar-M247 superalloys in the air at 1150 degrees C
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Oxidation resistance of NiCoCrAlTaY coated and uncoated Mar-M247 superalloys were compared experimentally in the air at 1150 A degrees C. It was found that the oxidation behavior of the NiCoCrAlTaY coated and uncoated Mar-M247 superalloys generally followed the parabolic kinetics with the rate of 1.5 and 9.8 x 10(-3) mg(2)/cm(4) h for each one. Microstructural observation and elemental analysis indicated that after 200 h the uncoated alloy covered with an oxide scale of 6-10 times thicker than the coated one, beneath which a fairly continuous and relatively thin alpha-Al2O3 could be found along the interface close to the substrate. Comparatively, the NiCoCrAlTaY coated alloy uniformly produced the continuous, dense and thick alpha-Al2O3 layer adhesive to the coating to prevent the metal elements against excessive oxidation, and finally formed the steady oxide scales: outer (Ni, Co)(Al, Cr)(2)O-4 spinels, NiO, (Al, Cr)(2)Ni-3; inner protective alpha-Al2O3 with a little Cr2O3. On the surface of the uncoated alloy, however, it mainly formed the Ni-rich oxides in which a large quantity of cracks propagated to result in the more oxidation.

TI Microstructural changes as postmortem temperature indicator in

SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB Microstructural changes in a metallic oxidation protection coating (Ni-Co-Cr-Al-Y) applied on a nickel base superalloy were investigated by means of scanning and transmission electron microscopy. The changes are due either to thermal mechanical fatigue testing under high thermal gradients or to defined isothermal heat treatments. The coated specimens were quenched from temperatures between 840 and 1100degreesC to ambient temperature. The resultant phases, their local distribution and compositions were determined by energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy and electron diffraction. Phase equilibria at respective temperatures were determined by thermodynamic calculations based on the CALPHAD method. The calculated and experimentally determined phase distributions were compared. A particular microstructural feature, namely the existence and spatial distribution of spherical gamma' Ni3Al precipitates in the coating and the diffusion zone between substrate and coating, was used as a postmortem indicator for the maximum temperature experienced by the specimen during testing. This paper gives a road map for developing a microstructural-based temperature calibration for complex metallic materials using thermodynamic simulations. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The low cycle fatigue behavior of a new cast and wrought Ni-Co-base superalloy TMW-4M3 was studied at 400, 650 and 725 degrees C under various strain ranges (0.79-1.22%). Detailed studies were performed on cyclic hardening/softening behavior, deformation substructure, fatigue life, as well as crack initiation and subsequent propagation. Continuous cyclic hardening until fracture was observed under various imposed strain ranges at 400 degrees C. Such hardening behavior was absent, whereas cyclic softening from the first cycle to failure at 650 and 725 degrees C was observed, except at 650 degrees C and low strain range (0.8%) where specimen exhibited relative stable stress response until failure initiation. Transmission electron microscopy analysis reveals that the cyclic hardening is due to the inhomogeneous dislocation activity and interactions of dislocations, and that cyclic softening is related to shearing of precipitates by stacking fault and coupled dislocation pairs combining with thermal activation process. Fatigue life decreased with increasing the test temperature or strain range. The relation between fatigue life and plastic strain followed the Coffin-Manson relation. Cracks often initiated on or near the surfaces of specimen during cycling, while subsurface carbide clusters initiation was also observed. Oxidation plays key role in accelerating crack propagation at 650 and 725 degrees C.

TI Analysis of carboneceous deposits from thermal stressing of a JP-8 fuel
   on superalloy foils in a flow reactor
SO INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH
AB A flow reactor study was carried out to investigate the carbon deposition on nickel-, cobalt-, molybdenum-, and iron-based alloy foils during thermal stressing of a JP-8 fuel at 500 degreesC wall temperature and 34 atm (500 psig), for 5 h at a fuel flow rate of 4 mL/min. Temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) analysis and SEM examination showed that the amount and the nature of the carbonaceous deposits on the foils depend strongly on the chemical composition of the foil surface. The amount of carbon deposited on metal foils decreased in the order Inconel 600 > Havar > Fecralloy > Waspaloy > Hastelloy-C > MoRe > Inconel 718. The presence of minor components, such as Ti, Al, and Nb, in the alloys appears to be responsible for reducing carbon deposition from jet fuel thermal stressing. This effect can be attributed to the formation of a passive layer on alloy surfaces that limits the access of deposit precursors to base metals, Ni, Fe, and Co, that catalyze deposit formation.

SO CORROSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-KOREA
AB Alloy 617 is a candidate Ni-based superalloy for intermediate heat exchanger (IHX) of a high-temperature gas reactor (VHTR), because of its good creep strength and corrosion resistance at high temperature. Small amount of impurities such as H2O, H-2, CO and CH4 are introduced inevitably in helium, as a coolant during operation of a VHTR. Reactions of material and impurities are accelerated with increase of temperature to 950 degrees C of operating temperature of a VHTR, leading to material corrosion aggravation. In this circumstance, high-temperature corrosion tests were performed at 950 degrees C in air and impure helium environments, up to 250 hours in this study. Oxidation rate of 950 degrees C in an air environment was higher than that of impure helium, explained by difference in outer oxide morphology and microstructure as a function of oxygen partial pressure. An equiaxed Cr-rich surface oxide layer was formed in an air environment, and a columnar Cr-rich oxide was formed in an impure helium environment.

TI Use of plasma spray technology for deposition of high temperature
   oxidation/corrosion resistant coatings - a review
SO MATERIALS AND CORROSION-WERKSTOFFE UND KORROSION
AB High temperature oxidation is one of the main failure modes of the hot-section components in gas turbines, boilers, waste incinerations, diesel engines, coal gasification plants, chemical plants and other energy generation systems. In such applications the use of Fe-, Ni- and Co-based alloys, especially of superalloys is well known. The superior mechanical strength and good corrosion resistance of the superalloys at high temperature make them favorites for such applications. However, the presence of combustion gases constitutes an extreme environment and hot corrosion is inevitable when superalloys are used at high temperatures for long durations of time. Therefore these alloys need to be protected against this type of oxidation. Several countermeasures have been suggested in the literature to combat the same. One such countermeasure against hot corrosion and oxidation constitutes the deposition of protective coatings on these alloys. Among the various techniques used for deposition of coatings, plasma spraying is a versatile technology that has been successful as a reliable cost-effective solution for many industrial problems. It allows the spraying of a wide range of high performance materials from superalloys and refractory intermetallic compounds to ceramics with continuously increasing commercial applications. Furthermore it does not cause deterioration of the substrate alloys, and relatively thick coatings can be formed with high deposition rates. In this paper the technique of plasma spraying has been detailed and the role of plasma sprayed coatings to arrest high temperature oxidation has been discussed with the help of a comprehensive literature survey. The main focus of this investigation is the studies related to plasma sprayed Ni-CrA1Y, Ni-Cr, Nickel aluminide and Co-based coatings.

TI Spalling failure of a thermal barrier coating associated with aluminum
   depletion in the bond-coat
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB A plasma-sprayed thermal barrier coating is observed to spall after oxidation at 1121 degrees C from a CoNiCrAlY bond-coated superalloy at the interface between the thermally grown oxide (TGO) and the zirconia thermal barrier coating (TBC). Phase characterization by photostimulated luminescence and X-ray diffraction, as well as microstructural characterization by scanning electron microscopy, indicates that the spalling is associated with the conversion of the initially formed alpha-alumina thermally grown oxide to alpha-chromia and a (CoNi)(CrAl) spinel. It is proposed that the phase conversion occurs after the alumina TGO has cracked on thermal cycling and the underlying bond-coat alloy is depleted of aluminum with concurrent enrichment of the oxide by Cr, Co and Ni. The observations suggest that monitoring the luminescence intensity as a function of oxidation time might form the basis of a nondestructive tool for detecting the onset of failure based on the disappearance of alpha-alumina.

AB A MCrAlY+AlSiY composite coating was prepared by arc ion plating. Hot corrosion behaviours of the composite coating and the reference NiCoCrAlYSiB coating were investigated. The results indicate that the composite coating consisted of beta-(Ni,Co)Al with dispersed sigma-NiCoCr and Cr3Si in outer layer and Cr-rich phases in inner layer after annealing. As being corroded for 200 h, the composite coating proved better corrosion resistance than that of reference NiCoCrAlYSiB coating. The enhanced corrosion resistance of the composite coating was due to the gradient distribution of Al-enriched outer layer and Cr-enriched inner layer. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI DEVELOPMENT OF NI-BASED DS SUPERALLOY WITH EXCELLENT OXIDATION
   RESISTANCE AND LCF PROPERTIES FOR POWER-GENERATION GAS TURBINES
SO SUPERALLOYS 2012
CT 12th International Symposium on Superalloys
CY SEP 09-13, 2012

AB In advanced industrial gas-turbine systems, there is a great demand for a new, excellent superalloy which can be used for large gas-turbine blades. Because it is very difficult to produce a large-scale Ni-based Single Crystal (SC) blade, we have developed new Directionally Solidified (DS) superalloys with an excellent combination of high-temperature creep strength, low-cycle-fatigue strength, good oxidation resistance, castability and hot-corrosion resistance. In this study, three kinds of Ni-based DS superalloys were designed with the aid of the d-electrons concept. The chemical compositions of these alloys were in the range of 1.4%Ti, 8.2%Cr, 11%Co, (0-1.0)%Ru, 3.6%Ta, 9.2%W, 1.0%Re, 5.2%Al, 1.40%Hf and balanced Ni in weight percent (wt%). Creep rupture tests, hot-corrosion burner-rig tests, low-cyclefatigue tests and oxidation tests were conducted with heat-treated DS specimens of these alloys. Two of the designed alloys showed the same level of creep rupture life as those of the 2nd generation DS superalloys currently in wide use. Oxidation tests at 1313K proved that the oxidation resistance of all the designed alloys was superior to that of all the reference alloys. The results of the hot-corrosion burner-rig tests showed that all the designed alloys had better corrosion resistance than the 2nd generation DS superalloys. As for Low-Cycle-Fatigue (LCF) strength, it was found that even 0.6%Ru addition greatly improved LCF strength, and the 0.6%Ru containing Alloy-B showed better LCF strength than any commercially used reference DS superalloys. A casting test was accomplished in a model bucket of a first stage blade of a 25MW-class gas turbine.
   Alloy-B is potentially a suitable alloy for making gas turbine blades with prolonged lifetimes and low maintenance costs in recent 1500 degrees C-class or even higher class gas turbines for power generation.

AB In this study, the microstructure of the bond coat of the YSZ/NiCrAlCo-Y2O3 systems after isothermal oxidation was examined. The ceramic top coating (YSZ) and bond coat (NiCrAlCo-Y2O3) were manufactured by atmospheric plasma spraying (APS) process and were sprayed onto Inconel 718 superalloy. The thickness of the NiCrAlCo-Y2O3 bond coat was 140 +/- 10 mu m. Isothermal oxidation tests were performed at 1050 degrees C during 100 and 200 h in static air. The thermally grown oxide (TGO) layer was formed at the interface between the top coat and the bond coat as a consequence of the isothermal oxidation tests. Cross-section samples after isothermal oxidation were evaluated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The analysis of EDS was performed to the TGO and the lamellas of bond coat near to the TGO. The results showed that the TGO layer was composed mainly of chromium and oxygen as resulting from its diffusion and oxidation. The analysis of the lamellas near to the TGO showed elements such as Ni, Cr, and Co, which are related to the chemical composition of the bond coat. Additionally, Inconel 718 alloys constituents such as Fe and Nb were found in the same area as the result of the diffusion of these elements through the bond coat.

AB The oxidation characteristics of Alloy 617, a candidate structural material for the key components in the very high-temperature gas-cooled reactor (VHTR), were investigated. High-temperature oxidation tests were conducted at 900 and 1100 degrees C in air and helium environments and the results were analysed. Alloy 617 showed parabolic oxidation behaviour at 900 degrees C, but unstable oxidation behaviour at 1100 degrees C, even in a low oxygen-containing helium environment. The SEM micrographs also revealed that the surface oxides became unstable and non-continuous as the temperature or the exposure time increased. According to the elemental analysis, Cr-rich oxides were formed on the surface and Al-rich discrete internal oxides were formed below the surface oxide layer. After 100 h in 1100 degrees C air, the Cr-rich surface oxide became unstable and non-continuous, and the matrix elements like Ni and Co were exposed and oxidized. Depletion of grain boundary carbides as well as matrix carbides was observed during the oxidation in both environments. When tensile loading was applied during high-temperature oxidation, the thickness of the surface oxide layer, the internal oxidation, and decarburization were enhanced because of the increase in diffusion of oxidizing agent and gaseous reaction products. Such enhancement would have detrimental effects on the high-temperature mechanical properties, especially the creep resistance of Alloy 617 for the VHTR application. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Effect of Ru on the Oxidation Behavior of a Ni-Base Single-Crystal
   Superalloy
SO SCIENCE OF ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB The effect of Ru on the isothermal oxidation of Ni-base single crystal superalloys has been investigated by discontinuous thermogravimetric analysis. The scale structures were analyzed using XRD, SEM and EDX. The kinetic curves of the alloys exposed at 1000 degrees C and 1100 degrees C obeyed the parabolic law, and the addition of Ru had minimal direct effect on the oxide phase types. The scales for three alloys with various Ru additions were mainly composed of an outer (Ni, Co) O layer, a second complex oxides layer, and an inner Al2O3 layer. The spallation of the scale was observed after a long time oxidation at 1000 degrees C and 1100 degrees C. The mass gains of the alloys with Ru addition were higher than those of the alloys without Ru addition when exposed to high temperatures at 1000 degrees C and 1100 degrees C. This showed that the addition of Ru can reduce the oxidation resistance in the alloy oxidation at high temperatures due to Ru inhibiting the formation of Al2O3 layer. Furthermore, the rate of oxidation for the alloy with 3 Ru addition at 1100 degrees C was slower than that of the alloy with 1.5 Ru addition since the weak-bond in NiWO4 was limited by Ru addition. The internal nitride was obtained from the three alloys with Ru addition due to the loose Al2O3 films.

AB In this study, the Hastelloy-X superalloy samples were overlaid by a CoNiCrAlY bond coating using a high pressure high velocity oxygen fuel (HVOF) spray process. A thin platinum film around 7.5 mu m thick was further applied to the surface of CoNiCrAlY coating by the magnetron sputtering deposition. Then the superalloy coupons with bare bond coat and with Pt deposited bond coat were pack aluminized at 850 degrees C for 4 h to produce (Ni,Co)Al and PtAl2 phases on surfaces, respectively. After that, all samples were overlaid with the yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) top coats by air plasma spraying (APS). Then specimens were subjected to a thermal cycling test at 1100 degrees C. Thermal cycling tests were 1 h at 1100 degrees C followed by 10 min of forced-air cooling to ambient temperature outside the furnace. The weights of all the specimens were measured every 2 cycles. Then effects of aluminizing and Pt-aluminizing on the cyclic oxidation performance and microstructure evolutions of the coatings were evaluated. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffractometry (XRD) and electron probe microanalyzer (EPMA) were used to identify crystalline phases and microstructures of each coating. The results proved that the roughness of the CoNiCrAlY coating was not changed after the aluminizing or the Pt-aluminizing process. The specific weight gain of the thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) with aluminizing or with Pt-aluminizing bond coating was lower than that of TBCs with only HVOF sprayed bond coat. The cyclic oxidation life of sprayed MCrAlY/ZrO2-Y2O3 thermal barrier coating can be improved effectively by either aluminizing or Pt-aluminizing treatment. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.

CL Hakodate, JAPAN
AB The microstructure and hot corrosion behavior of a Si-Y-Co-modified aluminide coating prepared on a nickel base superalloy DZ125 by the pack cementation process was studied. The Co-Al-Si-Y coated specimen had a mass gain of only 0.25 mg/cm(2) after being exposed to NaCl + Na2SO4 salt for 100 h at 1173 K. Thus the addition of Si to a Y-Co-modified aluminide coating increased its hot corrosion resistance by 40 %. The improved hot corrosion resistance of the Co-Al-Si-Y coating was mainly attributed to the formation of an Al2O3 scale with SiO2 on the surface of the coating during the hot corrosion test. SiO2 can prohibit the high fluxing rate of dissolution of the protective Al2O3 scale and prevent rapid corrosion attack owing to its low solubility over a wide range of salt acidity and its weak oxygen permeability.
   Graphical Abstract
   The Co-Al-Si-Y coated specimen had a mass gain of only 0.25 mg/cm(2) after being exposed to NaCl + Na2SO4 salt for 100 h at 1173 K. The addition of Si to a Y-Co-modified aluminide coating improved its hot corrosion resistance.

TI CREEP MECHANISM OF A Ni-Co BASE WROUGHT SUPERALLOY
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB Ni-based wrought superalloys are widely used in the hot section of aircraft gas turbine engines for their capability in retaining strength and resisting creep, fatigue, and oxidation at elevated temperature. With the development of the newer generation turbine disk alloys, it is highly imperative for aircraft engine manufacturers to substantiate the use of the materials by conducting a thorough examination of their mechanical properties. As these components are subjected to elevated temperatures and complex stress state in the service process where time dependent creep is the primary deformation failure mechanism and life-limiting factor for the component, it is of great importance to evaluate the relationship between microstructure, creep behavior and the underlying creep deformation mechanism. Therefore, the main objective of the present research aims at investigating the fundamental relationship between external creep condition and internal creep deformation mechanism in a new wrought superalloy with low stacking fault energy (SFE). In order to study the influences of the loading stress level and temperature on the creep deformation mechanism, stress range of 345-840 MPa and temperature range of 650-815 degrees C were selected to carry out the creep experiment. The results show that two kinds of gamma' with different diameters distributed in the matrix and the larger one began to coarsen when the creep temperature increased to 725 degrees C. Under creep temperature of 650 degrees C, the formation of SF resulted from the shearing of gamma' by dislocations dominated the creep deformation. When the temperature range was raised up to 725-760 degrees C, SF and microtwins were the main microstructures after creep deformation. With further increasing the temperature and load, instead of accommodating only in the gamma', the SF and microtwins penetrated the whole gamma' and matrix area. When the temperature was increased to 815 degrees C, the climb/bypass mechanism controlled the creep process.

TI SEM/TEM Investigation of Aluminide Coating Co-Doped with Pt and Hf
   Deposited on Inconel 625
SO MATERIALS
AB The effect of simultaneous introduction of Hf and Pt into aluminide coating deposited on Inconel 625 alloy was investigated using scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM/TEM) methods. The coating consisted of two layers: the additive and the interdiffusion. The additive layer and part of the interdiffusion layer consist of the -NiAl type phase. The middle part of the interdiffusion layer comprised an interpenetrating finger-like structure formed by the -NiAl and TCP sigma type phases with numerous fine Cr precipitates in the former and occasional larger precipitates of NbC carbides interspersed in between them. The sigma type phase inclusions are situated at the border between the substrate and the interdiffusion layer. The experiment showed that platinum fully dissolves in the -NiAl-type matrix, while most of the introduced hafnium accumulates in HfO2 dioxide precipitates located close to the additive/interdifusion interface.

TI Surface chemistry evolution of F-doped Ni-base superalloy upon heat
   treatment
SO MATERIALS AND CORROSION-WERKSTOFFE UND KORROSION
AB Ni-based superalloys with Al-contents between 3 and 5wt% exhibit insufficient oxidation resistance at temperatures above 900 degrees C. A change of the oxidation mechanism has been achieved after doping surface-near regions with fluorine by ion implantation and subsequent heat treatment. With that, the formation of a protective alumina scale was observed. This study is dedicated to the nature of the kinetic bias for the alumina scale formation. The samples of alloy IN738 (3.5wt% Al) were implanted with F-ions (10(17)F/cm(2) at 38keV). The depth profiles of O, Ni, Cr, Co, Ti, and Al were determined using secondary neutrals mass spectrometry (SNMS), whereas the F-depth profiles were measured by non-destructive proton-induced gamma-ray emission (PIGE). Directly after F-implantation no Al-enrichment near the surface was observed. After heating up to temperatures between 400 and 800 degrees C, no distinct alumina scale formation was observed. At 1000 and 1050 degrees C, a distinct Al-rich region has formed. Extending the oxidation time up to 12h leads to a pronounced Al-profile, suggesting the growth of a pure alumina scale near the surface.

AB To further improve the cost-benefit of MCrAlX (X is a reactive element like Y, Hf, Ta, etc.) alloys, the microhardness, microstructure and oxidation behavior of two Ni-based alloys, Ni60Co30Al10 and Ni60Co10Cr20Al10 without reactive elements were studied by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and microhardness Vickers. These alloys were synthesized by mechanical alloying in a high energy ball mill and conventional sintering at 1100 degrees C under inert atmosphere. Milling time and Cr additions have a significant effect on microhardness of as-milled and sintered samples. Bulk samples were oxidized at 1000 degrees C for different times to analyze the possible growth of protective oxide scale, as well as the effect of Cr addition on the chemical composition of the oxide scale. After 3 h of oxidation the formation of Al2O3 oxide scale in the Ni60Co30Al10 alloy is evident. By reducing the Co content and incorporating 20 wt% of Cr, the formation of an Al2O3 oxide scale with the presence of Cr2O3 was observed. Even the formation of homogeneous, continuous and protective oxide products in the surface of samples is evident, the rnicrostructural changes after oxidation treatments have a significant effect on the decrease in microhardness of both alloys.

TI Effect of alloy composition on the oxidation-induced boron depletion in
   cast Ni-base superalloy components
SO MATERIALS AND CORROSION-WERKSTOFFE UND KORROSION
AB The high temperature air oxidation of the two conventionally cast Ni-based superalloys Rene 80 containing 92wtppm boron and CM 247 containing 110wtppm of boron was studied at temperatures between 850 and 1050 degrees C and times ranging from 1 to 100h. Analysis by GD-OES and SEM/WDX/EBSD revealed the surface scale on Rene 80 after exposure at 1050 degrees C to consist of Cr2O3 with TiO2 in the outer part and BCrO3 and CrTi2O5 in the inner part. Internal Al2O3 precipitates were present below the external scale. After 1h exposure of CM 247 an inner dense alumina scale formed over eutectic alloy regions containing coarse precipitates. Over dendritic regions a Cr-rich oxide scale with BCrO3-precipitates formed initially and aluminum was internally oxidized. After longer oxidation times an alumina sub-scale grew from the internal precipitates, and oxidation of the initially present depleted alloy zones resulted in formation of outer Ni and Co rich oxides. In both alloys, boron depletion in the bulk alloy occurred due to formation of the mentioned boron rich oxide. The extent of depletion was substantially higher for the chromia forming Rene 80 than for CM 247. In the latter material the boron depletion was suppressed after the formation of the dense, inner alumina scale.

AB Pt-modified Ni aluminicles and MCrAlY coatings (where M = Ni and/or Co) are widely used on turbine blades and vanes for protection against oxidation and corrosion and as bond coatings in thermal barrier coating (TBC) systems. The present work shows the ability of a new fabrication technique, the Spark Plasma Sintering, to develop rapidly new coating compositions and microstructurres. This technique allows combining powders and metallic foils on a superalloy substrate in order to obtain multilayered coatings in a single short experiment. Fabrication of MCrAlY overlays with local Pt and/or Al enrichment is shown, as well as fabrication of coatings made of xi-PtAl2, epsilon-PtAl, alpha-AlNiPt2, martensitic beta-(Ni,Pt)Al or Pt-rich gamma/gamma' phases. The realization of a complete TBC system with a porous and adherent Yttria Stabilized Zirconia (YSZ) layer on a gamma/gamma' low mass bond coating is also demonstrated. Difficulties of fabrication are reviewed and discussed, such as Y segregation, risks of carburization, local overheating, or difficulty to coat complex shape parts. Finally, some first results of cyclic oxidation are given. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Protection comes from the higher aluminium content in the coating to form Al2O3 at high temperature. However, these coatings may be harmful to the mechanical properties of the alloys as a result of the interdiffusion or thermal mismatch between the coating and substrate. Recently, a new kind of coating has been developed: high temperature oxidation resistant and hot corrosion resistant nanocrystalline coating, the composition of which is the same as the substrate. The only difference is that the grain size of the coating is several orders of magnitude smaller than that of the substrate. The formation of protective Al2O3 scale is not from the high aluminium. content, but from the grain boundary diffusion. The main advantages of this kind of coating are that neither interdiffusion nor thermal mismatch exist between coating and substrate. The present paper reviews the high temperature oxidation and hot corrosion resistant nanocrystalline coating with particular reference to the authors' own results.

TI Exploring the hindering mechanism of element Ti on the adherence of
   CoO-bearing one-coat enamel/steel
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED CERAMIC TECHNOLOGY
AB The effect of element Ti on adherence between a CoO-bearing single-layer enamel coating and steel was investigated. Falling-weights tests were carried out and cross-sections at interface of the enamel/substrate were analyzed with a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) coupled with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). Results show that addition of TiO2 reduced adherence of the enamel coating by hindering the formation of anchor-like alloy precipitates. The decrease of anchor points lies in the following three reasons: I. The diffusion path of Co2+ ions to the interface was lengthened because of the blocking effect of rutile and the FeTiO3 crystals; II. Formation of CoTiO3 crystals leads to a reduction of free Co2+ ions; III. Co-Fe precipitates form away from the enamel/substrate interface, as FeTiO3 crystals provide extra surface for the nucleation of Fe-Co alloy precipitates.

TI Effects of preoxidation on the nucleation and growth behavior of
   chemically vapor-deposited alpha-Al2O3 on a single-crystal Ni-based
   superalloy
SO METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND
   MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB A chemical vapor deposition (CVD) procedure was developed for preparing a high-quality alpha-Al2O3 coating layer on the surface of a single-crystal Ni-based superalloy using AlCl3, CO2 and H-2 as precursors. A critical part of this procedure was a short-time preoxidation step (1 min) with CO2 and H-2 in the CVD chamber, prior to introducing the AlCl3 precursor. Without this preoxidation step, extensive whisker formation was observed on the alloy surface. Characterization results showed that the preoxidation step resulted in the formation of a continuous oxide layer (similar to50 nm) on the alloy surface. The outer part of this layer (similar to20 nm) appeared to contain mixed oxides, whereas the inner part (similar to30 nm) mainly consisted of alpha-Al2O3 grains with theta-Al2O3 as a minor phase. We observed that the nucleation of alpha-Al2O3 in the preoxidized layer was promoted by (1) rapid heating (10 seconds) of the alloy surface to the temperature region where alpha-Al2O3 was expected to nucleate; (2) the low oxygen pressure environment of the preoxidation step, which kept the rate of oxidation low; and (3) contamination of the reactor chamber with HfCl4. The preoxidized layer served as an effective diffusion barrier for mitigating the interaction with some of the alloying elements such as Co and Cr with the CVD precursors and eliminating whisker formation on the alloy surface.

TI Thermal expansions of the beta and gamma phases in a Co-Ni-Fe superalloy
   determined by x-ray diffraction
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS RESEARCH
AB Commercially useful multiphase alloy Inconel 783 is made up of Ni(28%), Fe(25%), and Co(35%) with smaller amounts of Cr, Al, Nb, Mo, Ti, C, and Si. Ln this work, relative temperature variations of the lattice constants a(T)/a(0) of the gamma (face-centered-cubic) and beta (body-centered-cubic) phases of this alloy are determined from 97 to 773 K using analyses of their x-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns. Plots of a(T)/a(0) for the two phases vary from 1.0 at 97 K to 1.012 at 773 K and show that (i) for T > 500 K, thermal expansion of the beta phase is larger than that of the gamma phase; and (ii) an abrupt jump is observed near 300 K. The appearance of new lines above 700 K in XRD representing Co2CrO4 and CoCr2O4 is interpreted in terms of the oxidation of the gamma phase, whereas the beta phase is oxidation resistant. The anomalous change in a(T)/a(0), observed near 300 K and accompanied by a similar change in the temperature variation of the initial magnetic susceptibility, is not well understood. A brief discussion on the implications of these results is presented.

TI Synthesis and properties of open-cell Ni-Cr-Fe-Al alloy foams by pack
   co-deposition process
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY
AB A pack cementation process for the co-deposition of Cr, Fe and Al onto open-cell nickel foam was developed. The reticulated open-cell Ni-Cr-Fe-Al foams were annealed to homogenize the material with 18.8 wt.% Cr, 11.3 wt.% Fe and 7.7 wt.% Al. The microstructure and phase composition of the Ni-Cr-Fe-Al foams were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). X-ray diffraction (XRD) and energy dispersive analysis (EDS). The results show that the coating is uniform and dense along the perimeter of the Ni strut, and consists of three layers: a Cr-Fe outer layer, an inner layer containing mostly Al and a transition zone. After homogenization annealing, the alloyed foams retain the hollow struts structure of the original pure nickel foams and the low relative densities. The Ni-Cr-Fe-Al alloy foams exhibit enhancement in absolute strength as compared to the pure nickel and Ni-35.2Cr foams. Furthermore, the Ni-Cr-Fe-Al alloy foams show excellent oxidation resistance and outperform the chromia-forming Ni-35.2Cr alloy foam after oxidation,it 900 and 1000 degrees C, which is mainly due to its high aluminum and chromium content leading to the formation of a continuous and adherent duplex oxide layer.

TI An Atom Probe Tomography study of site preference and partitioning in a
   nickel-based superalloy
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB Atom Probe Tomography (APT) has been utilised for an in-depth examination of the commercial polycrystalline Ni-based superalloy RR1000, assessing compositions of the primary, secondary and tertiary gamma' phases. Clear differences in the phase chemistries are noted, particularly for the tertiary gamma' to which much of the alloy strength is attributed. Trace amounts of Hf are found to segregate strongly to the primary and secondary gamma' phases, but also exhibit an extended diffusion profile across the gamma-gamma' interface up to 80 nm wide. Ti, Al and Mo demonstrate similar, yet not as pronounced diffusion profiles, indicating assumed phase chemistries may not be representative of those regions adjacent to the gamma-gamma' interface. Within gamma', unique element site-occupancy preferences for this alloy were identified. Finally, the grain boundary chemistry across a gamma-gamma interface and that of an intragranular boride were analysed, identifying the latter as a mixed M5B3 boride rich in Mo and Cr. These demonstrate further the depth of information on Ni-alloys accessible by APT, while the overall implications of results in comparison with other in-service/model alloys are also discussed.

AB A silicate ceramic and a Co-based superalloy are put in contact at 700 degrees C and are submitted to fretting wear (small amplitude reciprocating movements). The present interface is a plane to plane 4 mm contact that is studied in cross section through SEM-EDX, high resolution TEM and XPS. The tribological test results in the formation of thick (20 mu m), compact third body that adheres on both counterparts in the interface. This third body, which is formed from mixed, grinded and sintered debris reacting with surrounding oxygen, is a glaze layer. The glaze layer created on the ceramic seems homogeneous at microscale but evidences a nanostructure of metallic 20 nm crystalline grains embedded in an amorphous oxidized matrix. This structure is similar in the layer adhering on the alloy but the matrix is crystalline, suggesting that the amorphization is promoted by ceramic elements. The main wear process argued is the wrenching of metallic grains that undergo further grinding without recrystallization, associated with diffusion and selective oxidation of some metallic elements.

   superalloy in Na2SO4-60%V2O5 environment at 900 degrees C - Part I:
   Characterization of the coatings
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING AND PERFORMANCE
AB This article demonstrates the successful formulation of NiCrBSi, Cr3C2-NiCr, Ni-20Cr, and Stellite-6 coatings on an Fe-based superalloy by a high-velocity oxyfuel (HVOF) process for hot corrosion applications. The microstructure, porosity, coating thickness, phase formation, and microhardness properties of the coatings have been characterized using the combined techniques of optical microscopy, x-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive x-ray analysis. A microhardness tester was used to determine the hardness of the coatings. The coatings in general exhibit characteristic splat-like, layered morphologies due to the deposition and resolidification of successive molten or semimolten powder particles. The NiCrBSi, Cr3C2-NiCr, and Ni-20Cr coatings have shown a nickel-base face-centered cubic (fcc) structure as a principal phase, whereas Stellite-6 coating has an fcc Co-rich metallic matrix. Oxides/spinel oxides are formed in small fraction as intersplat lamellae or globules oriented parallel to the substrate surface. Coatings possess some unmelted/partially melted particles, inclusions, and porosity less than 2%. The microhardness of the coatings is found to be higher than the superalloys. The Cr3C2-NiCr coating has indicated a maximum microhardness of 990 Hv, while a Ni-20Cr coating has shown a minimum value of about 600 Hv. This article is focused on the characterization of HVOF coatings. The hot corrosion behavior of these coatings in a molten salt (Na2SO4-60%V2O5) environment at 900 degrees C under cyclic conditions is being presented as part II included in this issue.

AB A low pressure plasma sprayed (LPPS) NiCoCrAlY aircraft turbine blade overlay coating was investigated by differential thermal analysis (DTA). A pronounced irreversible endothermic reaction peak was observed at 975 degreesC for the as-sprayed coating. No equivalent reaction is observed for the LPPS coating in the annealed state and in Ni-Co-Cr-Al (Ni:Co = 2:1) compositions after slow furnace cool-down as well. The reaction scheme for the partial ternary AlNi-Cr-Ni system was taken as a reference standard for understanding the irreversible reaction, and was reexamined where necessary. The four-phase solid state reaction in the ternary system at 995 degreesC, according to gamma-Ni + beta-NiAl --> gamma'-Ni3Al + alpha-Cr, is compared with the occurrence of the reaction observed at 975 degreesC on the as-sprayed NiCoCrAlY coating material. It runs most likely according to gamma-Ni + -gamma'-Ni(3)AI --> alpha-Cr + beta-NiAl. The reaction at 975 degreesC is discussed in terms of metastable phase formation sequences.

AB Electron Beam-Physical Vapor Desposited Thermal Barrier Coatings (EB-PVD TBC) on the Ni-base superalloy IN738LC were tested in respect to non-isothermal and cyclic oxidation resistance at 1100 degrees C. Two types of MCrAlY's (M = Ni, Co), a Co-base and a Ni-base, were used as bond coats (BC) for the TBC's. Additionally, free standing MCrAlY specimens of 2 mm thickness were manufactured by vacuum plasma spraying. The results of the present studies strongly indicate, that an important lifetime governing factor of the TBC is the yttrium incorporation into the alumina based Thermal Grown Oxide (TGO) which results in an increase of the TGO growth rate and in parallel in a decrease of the yttrium concentration in the coating. If the yttrium concentration has been decreased beneath a critical level, its positive effect on TGO adherence is lost, resulting in TGO spallation. The time required for yttrium exhaustion will not only depend on the initial yttrium content but also on the yttrium reservoir, which is directly proportional to the BC thickness. The transport of yttrium into the TGO seems to occur slower in a Co-based than in a Ni-based coating, resulting in a longer life time for the TBC on the CoNiCrAlY-BC. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

TI Mechanical and microstructural characterization of MCrAlY coatings
   produced by laser cladding: The influence of the Ni, Co and Al content
SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB Laser metal deposition (LMD) and laser cladding (LC) are alternative methods to thermal spraying processes to produce dense, high-quality coatings. In this work, two MCrAlY coatings (M = Ni + Co) have been prepared onto stainless steel substrate using a coaxial LC technique under two different Ni/Co and Al proportions. The mechanical properties were then evaluated with microhardness, nanoindentation, and three-point bending tests. The microstructure and composition of coatings were characterized by X-ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis and Field Emission Electron Microscopy (FESEM) coupled to an Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) detector. The study revealed that the gamma/beta phases formed in the MCrAIY coating microstructure result in a lower elastic modulus than the austenitic stainless steel substrate, while an inverse behavior for hardness was observed due the presence of the aluminum-rich beta-phase. Under flexural loads, the failure of coatings showed plasticity and anisotropy characteristics depending on the two laser tracks orientations evaluated.

TI Improvement of Corrosion Resistance of Hastelloy-N Alloy in LiF-NaF-KF
   Molten Salt by Laser Cladding Pure Metallic Coatings
SO COATINGS
AB The corrosion protection of Hastelloy-N alloy in LiF-NaF-KF (commonly referred to as FLiNaK) molten salt has been developed by pure Ni and Co coatings using the laser cladding technique. An immersion experiment with samples was performed in molten FLiNaK salt at 900 degrees C for 100 h. It was found that the corrosion rates of the pure Ni-coated specimen and the pure Co-coated specimen are 39.9% and 35.7% of that of Hastelloy-N alloy, respectively. A careful microstructural characterization indicates that a selective dissolution of the elemental Cr occurred in the surface of bare Hastelloy-N alloy, showing a severe intergranular corrosion. For pure metal-coated specimens, in contrast, only metal oxide formed during the laser cladding process dissolved into the molten fluoride salt. The dense pure metal (Ni or Co) coatings exhibit a slightly general corrosion and protect the Hastelloy-N substrate effectively. The possible corrosion mechanism for both coated and uncoated Hastelloy-N under the current experimental condition are discussed in this work.

TI The effect of Mn1.5Co1.5O4 coatings on the development of near surface

SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB The effect of reactively sintered Mn1.5Co1.5O4 (MCO) coatings on the development of surface microstructure for Haynes 230 (H230) oxidized in air at 800 degrees C has been studied using a combination of thermo-gravimetric analysis and electron microscopy techniques. The bare alloy exhibits a parabolic rate constant of 8.8 x 10(-9) mg(2)m(-4)s(-1) and forms a two-layer oxide scale with a continuous chromia layer and a thinner discontinuous MnCr2O4 overlayer. For the MCO-coated H230, the reduction step of the reactive sintering process converts the MCO coating to a mixture of Co and MnO with a thin Cr-rich oxide layer at the interface with the alloy substrate. Following the re-oxidation step, there is a 200 nm chromia layer and a 400 nm cubic spinel reaction layer (RL) between the alloy and the MCO. These layers thicken to 800 nm and 1.2 mu m, respectively after 1000 h oxidation. These observations are compared to our previous studies of MCO-coated Crofer 22 APU, and the implications for long-term SOFC performance are discussed. (C) 2014 United Technologies Research Center.

TI Erosion wear characteristics of HVOF Sprayed WC-Co-Cr and CoNiCrAlY
   coatings on IS-2062 structural steel
SO MATERIALS RESEARCH EXPRESS
AB Structural steel components of thermal power plants are exposed to the oxidative and erosive environment during the operation of the plants. Such steels have good structural properties but lack resistance to erosion. Hard coatings are deposited on structural steels to improve their erosion resistance while maintaining good structural properties. The current work emphasizes the role of HVOFsprayed WC-12Co-4Cr and Co-32-Ni-21Cr-8Al-0.5Y coatings on the erosive wear of IS-2062 structural steel. Coatings are evaluated in terms of hardness, erosion rate, adhesion to the substrate, surface roughness and porosity. The erosion tests are carried out using an air jet erosion tester at 30 degrees and 90 degrees impact angles under room temperature environment. From this investigation, it has been observed that WC-Co-Cr coating on IS-2062 structural steel provides better erosion resistance than Co-32-Ni-21Cr-8Al-0.5Y coating at both the impact angles. However, the higher erosion rate is found at 90 degrees impact angle than that at 30 degrees impact angle for both the coatings suggesting a dominating brittle erosion mechanism. Microhardness and surface roughness of the coatings played an important role in the erosion resistance of WC-Co-Cr and CoNiCrAlY coatings.

The results show that bond coat (BC) is composed of beta-(Ni,Co)Al and gamma solid solution at the initial cycles. beta phase is completely transformed into gamma at 185 cycles. The thermally grown oxide (TGO), which consists of an Al2O3 layer and a thin spinel layer, has a high growth rate and grows irregularly because of preferential oxidation of Hf rich phases in the BC. This TBC system has a larger critical TGO thickness for failure. The thickness of TGO at planar place is approximately 10 mu m when the TBCs spalled. Interfacial toughness decreases substantially at the initial stage of thermal cycling.

TI Preparation and Structure of Al plus Si Codeposited Coatings on.
   Ni-based Superalloys
SO RARE METAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING
AB The Al+Si codeposited coatings were prepared on DZ417G superalloy substrates by aluminization and siliconization using pack cementation. XRD, SEM and EDS were used to study the microstructure and morphology of coatings. The results show that during the co-deposition process, the structure formed on the coating surface changes with the change of Al and Si contents. In addition, the post heat-treatment also has an effect on the structure of coatings. When the composition (in wt%) of the packs is XAl-4NH(4)Cl-4Si-(92-X)Al2O3 (X= I, 4 and 6), the corresponding structures of the coatings are NiSi and Ni2Al3 after pack cementation, respectively. When Si content increases to 6 wt% and 10 wt%, the structure of the coatings is also NiSi or Ni2Al3. After post heat-treatment, because of Ni, Cr and Mo diffusion from the substrate, NiSi transforms to AlNi6Si3 or S-Ni2Si, while Ni2Al3 transforms to beta-NiAl. The Si level in the beta-NiAl coatings is very small. Cr or Mo dissolves into AlNi6Si3, delta-Ni2Si and beta-NiAl. Al content plays a role in the formations of coatings. When Al content is low in the pack, the structure of coatings is NiSi after Al + Si codeposition. However, when the Al content is above 4 wt%, the structures of coatings are Ni2Al3 after pack cementation. Cr-rich AlNi6Si3, Cr- and Mo-rich delta-Ni2Si as well as beta-NiAl coatings are formed after Al + Si codeposition followed by post heat-treatment.

AB To meet the requirements of 700 degrees C ultra-supercritical (USC) coal-fired power plants, a new Ni-Fe based alloy (GH984G) has been developed. GH984G has excellent creep strength, thermal stability and resistance to oxidation/corrosion. Harmful phases were not observed even if after thermal exposure at 650-750 degrees C for 35,000 h. After exposure at 700 degrees C for 30,000 h, the yield strength has no obvious change. Its 105 h creep strength at 700 degrees C is up to 137 MPa and comparable to the level of 617B. The oxidation/corrosion evaluate at 700-800 degrees C up to 2000 h shows that it can meet the requirements of 700 degrees C USC coal-fired power plants. Currently, the pipes and tubes with different sizes have been manufactured. Moreover, it is an economic alloy due to the elimination of Co and containing more than 20% Fe. This makes it an interesting alternative for 700 degrees C USC coal-fired power plants and is now being evaluated at test platform for key components of China.

TI Protective coatings for aeronautic and power generation turbines
   components deposited by plasma spray
SO BOLETIN DE LA SOCIEDAD ESPANOLA DE CERAMICA Y VIDRIO
AB Coatings produced by aluminium diffusion, called aluminide are employed to increase the oxidation and corrosion resistance, increasing the life of Ni and Co base superalloys components at temperatures comprised between 900 and 1050 degrees C. Consequently these coatings are frequently employed in aeronautic and Fewer generation turbines as well as in the chemical industry. Aluminides are industrially produced by pack cementation or CVD and recently it has been demonstrated that its resistance significantly increases when Cr is added (chrome-aluminides). During this work, a feasibility study has been carried out in order to determine if plasma spray can be employed for depositing this type of coatings on turbine blades. Therefore, aluminium and aluminium/chromium layers were deposited on Ni base IN100 superalloy specimens that were subsequently subjected to a diffusion heat treatment under Ar flow Characterisation and analysis of the coatings were carried out by metallography, SEM and EDS. Cyclic oxidation tests were carried out at 1050 degrees C while molten sulphate hot corrosion was performed at 900 degrees C. The results of this preliminary study are promising and indicate that plasma spray can be developed as an industrial process for production of aluminide and chrome-aluminide coatings.

TI Microstructure assessment at high temperature in NiCoCrAlY overlay
   coating obtained by laser metal deposition
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY-JMR&T
AB Laser metal deposition (LMD) and laser cladding (LC) could be innovative methods to the current thermal spray techniques for obtaining dense and high-quality bond coats with nickel and cobalt based superalloys in thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) systems. The microstructural evolution of the coatings when is subjected to high temperatures allows us to evaluate their oxidation behavior and integrity in the time, and is especially important in the development of bond coats for new TBCs systems. In this work, the microstructural evolution of a dense NiCoCrAlY overlay coating obtained by coaxial laser cladding and subjected to isothermal oxidation tests at 1100 degrees C up to 200 h was evaluated. The initial coating microstructure is composed of a beta-NiAl phase within the gamma-Ni matrix phase, and some Y inclusions, confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). At high temperature, the thermally-grown oxides (TGO) protect the underlying coating and substrate from oxidation, modifying the initial microstructure of the coating. The formation, morphology and evolution of oxides alpha-Al2O3, Y2O3, YA1O(3) and (Ni,Co)(AlCr2)(2) O-4-type spinel oxides on the cross section of the oxidized coating on different oxidation stages were evaluated using focused ion beam (FIB) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), and indexed by XRD and TEM. After oxidation tests, no cracks or spallation on oxidized sample for NiCoCrAlY coating were observed, and the formation of Y-Al oxides in TGO scale are strongly dependent on the initial Y distribution of as-built condition in the coating.

TI Preparation of a Duplex Nanocrystalline Coating by Magnetron Sputtering
   and Its Oxidation Performance
SO JOURNAL OF NANOSCIENCE AND NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB A duplex nanocrystalline coating was prepared in this study by magnetron sputtering on N5 single-crystal super alloy (Ni: Bal, Co: 7.5, Cr: 7.0, Al: 6.2, Ta: 6.5, Re: 3.0, Mo: 1.5 and W: 5.0, wt%). The novel nanocrystalline coating consists of two layers, the inner layer having the same composition with the alloy substrate for avoiding elements inter diffusion while the outer layer has 7.6 wt% higher Al to quickly ensure the formation of a protective Al2O3 layer. Both two layers were deposited within one magnetron sputtering apparatus that contained two targets. The main target was having the same alloy substrate in composition and secondary target with pure Al. The difference in Al content between the two layers was achieved by controlling the secondary target during sputtering. This study revealed a way for preparing a series of similar coatings with varying compositions and improving performance. After oxidation at 1050 degrees C, a protective Al2O3 layer was quickly formed on the duplex nanocrystalline coating and no TCP phases were detected in the alloy substrate.

SO JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES
CT 8th Grove Fuel Cell Symposium

CL London, ENGLAND
AB Oxide scale formations in anode gas atmospheres were investigated for three different Fe-Cr alloys as interconnects in solid oxide fuel cells (ZMG232, SUS430, and Fe-Cr-W). Oxidation with anode gases (CH4, H2O, CO, and CO2) caused a relatively thick oxide scale formation on the alloy surfaces even in low oxygen partial pressures at 1073 K. The distribution of elements in the oxide scale and the growth rates of oxide scales were compared among the examined alloys by glow discharge optical emission spectrometry (GDOES). Mn-Fe-Cr spinels and Cr2O3 were formed on ZMG232 and SUS430 surfaces, whereas only Cr2O3 formation was observed on Fe-Cr-W surface. Oxide scale thickness grew with annealing time by a parabolic relationship, and the growth rates were in the orders of 10(-6) to 10(-5)mum(2) s(-1) at 1073 K. The electrical conductivity after forming oxide scales was different depending on the oxide scale phases and thickness. The conductivity was in the order of 10S cm(-2) at 973 K for ZMG232 alloy.

TI Looking for New Polycrystalline MC-Reinforced Cobalt-Based Superalloys
   Candidate to Applications at 1200 degrees C
SO ADVANCES IN MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
AB For applications for which temperatures higher than 1150 degrees C can be encountered the currently best superalloys, the gamma/gamma' single crystals, cannot be used under stress because of the disappearance of their reinforcing gamma' precipitates at such temperatures which are higher than their solvus. Cobalt-based alloys strengthened by refractory and highly stable carbides may represent an alternative solution. In this work the interest was focused on MC carbides of several types. Alloys were elaborated with atomically equivalent quantities in M element (among Ti, Ta, Nb, Hf, or Zr) and in C. Script-like eutectic TiC, TaC, NbC, HfC, and ZrC carbides were successfully obtained in the interdendritic spaces. Unfortunately, only one type, HfC, demonstrated high morphological stability during about 50 hours at 1200 degrees C. The concerned alloy, of the Co-25Cr-0.5C-7.4Hf type (in wt.%), was further characterized in flexural creep resistance and air-oxidation resistance at the same temperature. The creep behaviour was very good, notably by comparison with amore classical Co-25Cr-0.5C-7.5Ta alloy, proving that the interest of HfC is higher than the TaC one. In contrast the oxidation by air was faster and its behaviour not really chromia-forming. Significant improvements of this chemical resistance are expected before taking benefit from the mechanical superiority of this alloy.

   application to the recycling of Ni-Co-Fe-based end-of-life superalloys
   via remelting
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MINERALS METALLURGY AND MATERIALS
AB To design optimal pyrometallurgical processes for nickel and cobalt recycling, and more particularly for the end-of-life process of Ni-Co-Fe-based end-of-life (EoL) superalloys, knowledge of their activity coefficients in slags is essential. In this study, the activity coefficients of NiO and CoO in CaO-Al2O3-SiO2 slag, a candidate slag used for the EoL superalloy remelting process, were measured using gas/slag/metal equilibrium experiments. These activity coefficients were then used to consider the recycling efficiency of nickel and cobalt by remelting EoL superalloys using CaO-Al2O3-SiO2 slag. The activity coefficients of NiO and CoO in CaO-Al2O3-SiO2 slag both show a positive deviation from Raoult's law, with values that vary from 1 to 5 depending on the change in basicity. The activity coefficients of NiO and CoO peak in the slag with a composition near B = (%CaO)/(%SiO2) = 1, where B is the basicity. We observed that controlling the slag composition at approximately B = 1 effectively reduces the cobalt and nickel oxidation losses and promotes the oxidation removal of iron during the remelting process of EoL superalloys.

SO CORROSION ENGINEERING SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB This paper aims to investigate the hot corrosion resistance of high velocity oxy-fuel (HVOF) sprayed cobalt based (Stellite-6) and nickel based (Ni-20Cr) coatings deposited on the superalloy Superni-718 (Ni-19Cr-18.5Fe-5.13Ta-3.05Mo-0.9Ti-0.5Al-0.18Mn-0.18Si-0.15Cu0.04C) in the Na(2)SO(4)-60%V(2)O(5) salt environment at 900 degrees C under cyclic conditions. The X-ray diffractometry, scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive analysis and electron probe microanalyser techniques were used to study the corrosion products with respect to their morphology, phase composition and element concentration. The thermogravimetric technique was used to establish the kinetics of corrosion. The bare alloy underwent severe hot corrosion attack. The Ni-20Cr coating shows excellent hot corrosion resistance with negligible spallation, whereas Stellite-6 coating reveals less hot corrosion resistance and more spallation. The hot corrosion resistance of Ni-20Cr coating has been attributed to the formation of oxides of chromium, nickel and spinel of nickel chromium. The oxides of silicon, chromium, cobalt and spinels of cobalt-chromium and nickel-chromium have contributed for hot corrosion resistance of Stellite-6 coatings.

TI Sulphidation Behavior of a Non Harmful Water-Based Al and Al-Si Slurry
   Coating on CM247 Superalloy
SO OXIDATION OF METALS
AB Slurry aluminide coatings are widely applied to protect metallic surfaces from oxidation and corrosion. They are frequently used in gas turbine engine nozzles because of economical advantages and a straight-forward manufacturing route. A variety of commercial slurries are available to aluminize the surfaces of nickel-based superalloys, however, they have two main disadvantages. First, the phosphates and chromates or halides used as binders and to activate the diffusion species are environmentally harmful; second, the conventional systems have to be heat-treated in an inert atmosphere. As an outcome of the PARTICOAT project the variety of slurry derived coatings has been extended by tailoring the particle size of the metallic source. By doing that, environmentally friendly water-based slurries were developed to produce in a one-step process und atmospheric conditions, a thermal barrier system based on an aluminum diffusion layer and an alumina foam layer which serves as bond coat as well as top coat (TC). CM 247 nickel base superalloy was coated and heat-treated in air using newly developed Al and Al-Si slurries. The oxidation behavior was investigated at 1,000 A degrees C and then compared to pack-cemented aluminide coatings. The sulphidation behavior was investigated at 1,000 A degrees C in an atmosphere of 1.5 vol% SO2 in synthetic air for Al and Al-Si slurry coated samples with and without the alumina foam TC layer. PARTICOAT Al-based slurries,, after the initial stabilization of the TC, showed similar oxidation kinetics as pack cemented aluminides when exposed to air. When the coatings were exposed to sulphide-containing atmospheres, their oxidation rates increased, producing typical type I corrosion damage. Coatings without TC produced more protective oxide scales. The weight gain and coating area affected by corrosion were slightly lower for the Al-based slurries after 1,000 h of exposure than for the Al-Si based ones. The new coating presented here offers unique advantages in comparison to state-of-the-art slurry and pack cemented coatings by opening a potential way to manufacture a complete thermal barrier coating system by a simple, inexpensive and environmentally safe deposition and heat-treatment in air.

Corrosion products have been characterized using X-ray diffractometer (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive analysis (SEM/EDAX). Cr3C2-(NiCr) + 0.2%wtZr coating provides very good corrosion resistance in air oxidation for all the three coated superalloys. As all the three coated superalloys shows parabolic behaviour with parabolic rate constant as 0.07 x 10(-10) (g(2) cm(-4) s(-1)) for Superni 718, 0.43 x 10(-10) (g(2) cm(-4) s(-1)) for Superni 600 and 0.3 x 10(-10) (g(2) cm(-4) s(-1)) for Superco 605 This coating is also effective in the molten salt environment but coating on Co-based superalloy Superco 605 did not perform satisfactorily. The parabolic rate constants for coated Superni 718 is 0.61 x 10-10 (g(2) cm(-4) s(-1)), for coated Superni 600 is 6.72 x 10(-1) (g(2) cm(-4) s(-1)) and for coated Superco 605 is 17.5 x 10(-10) (g(2) cm(-4) s(-1)).

AB Furnace thermal cycling lifetime and microstructural degradation are reported for thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) with air plasma sprayed (APS) ZrO2-8 wt.%Y2O3 (YSZ) and APS CoNiCrAlY bond coats. TBCs examined in this study consisted of 600 mu m-thick APS YSZ, 175 mu m-thick APS CoNiCrAlYSi and 5 mm-thick Haynes 230 superalloy substrate. Furnace thermal cycling was carried out using 1-, 10- and 50-hour thermal cycles that consisted of 10-minute heat-up to 1121 degrees C, dwell at 1121 degrees C and followed by 10-minute forced-air-quench. To further document microstructural degradation of APS CoNiCrAlY coatings, free-standing APS CoNiCrAlY coatings were produced and isothermally oxidized at 1124C for LIP to 300 h. Despite the significant internal oxidation of APS CoNiCrAlY bond coats, APS TBCs exhibited excellent thermal cycling lifetime. Microstructural evolution of TBCs with an emphasis on the development of thermally grown oxide including internal oxidation was examined by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning TEM. Site-specific TEM specimen was prepared by using Focus Ion Beam In-situ Lift-out technique. Extensive internal oxidation was observed including formation of Al2O3, (Al,Cr)(2)O-3 and (Ni,Co)(Al, Cr)(2)O-4 identified by electron diffraction. Quantitative microscopy and a simple rule of mixture were employed to understand the excellent performance of these TBCs with APS CoNiCrAlY bond coats based on reduced thermal expansion mismatch.

Results indicated that a dual layered TGO, which consisted of top (Ni,Co)(Cr,Al)(2)O-4 spinel and underlying alpha-Al2O3, was formed at the NiCoCrAlY/4YSZ interface with thickness of 8.4 mu m, accompanying with visible cracks at the interface. In contrast, a single-layer and adherent alpha-Al2O3 scale with thickness of 5.6 mu m was formed at the interface of Pt-modified NiCoCrAlY and 4YSZ top coating. The modification of Pt on NiCoCrAlY favored the exclusive formation of alpha-Al2O3 and the reduction of TGO growth rate, and thus could effectively improve overall oxidation performance and extend service life of TBCs. Oxidation and degradation mechanisms of the TBCs with/without Pt-modification were discussed.

TI Comparison of O adsorption on Ni3Al (001), (011), and (111) surfaces
   through first-principles calculations
SO PHYSICA B-CONDENSED MATTER
AB First-principles calculations were performed to study the properties of O adsorption on Ni3Al (0 0 1), (0 1 1), and (1 1 1) surfaces using the Cambridge serial total package (CASTEP) code. Stable adsorption sites are identified. The atomic and electronic structures and adsorption energies are predicted. The adsorption sites for O on the Ni3Al (0 0 1) surface are at the 2Ni-2Al fourfold hollow site, whereas O prefers to adsorb at the Ni-Al bridge site on (0 1 1) surface and 2Ni-Al threefold hollow site on (1 1 1) surface. It is found that O shows the strongest affinity for Al and the state of O is the most stabilized when O adsorbs on (0 0 1) surface, while the affinity of O for Al on (0 1 1) surface is weaker than (0 0 1) surface, and (1 1 1) surface is the weakest. The stronger O and Al affinity indicates more stable Al2O3 when oxidized. The experiment has shown that the oxidation resistance of single crystal superalloy in different orientations improves in the order of (1 11), (0 1 1), and (0 0 1) surface, suggesting that the oxidation in different crystallographic orientations may be related to the affinity of O for Al in the surface.

TI CYCLIC OXIDATION AND HOT CORROSION BEHAVIORS OF A GRADIENT NiCoCrAlYSi
   COATING
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB MCrAlY (M=Ni and/or Co) coatings are widely used as overlays or bond coats for thermal barrier coatings due to their good performance against high temperature oxidation and hot corrosion. Usually, high Al content in the MCrAlY coatings can benefit the performance and lifetimes of the coatings. However, MCrAIY coatings usually contain only restricted Al content because high Al content might lead to brittleness and potential crack. Design of gradient coating can be used to solve the problem, since it can provide a balance between high Al content and high stress bearing ability. Therefore, much attention has been paid to coatings with gradient structures, and these coatings show good oxidation and corrosion resistance. In this work, a gradient and a conventional NiCoCrAlYSi coating were prepared by arc ion plating technique and subsequent annealing treatment. Cyclic oxidation tests of the two coatings were carried out between room temperature and 1000 degrees C. The hot corrosion tests of the coatings were performed in two different mixed salts of 75%Na2SO4+25%K2SO4 and 75%Na2SO4+25%NaCl (mass fraction) at 900 degrees C. The results indicated that the gradient coating possessed a graded distribution of Al-rich outer layer and Cr-rich inner layer after annealing treatment, and it showed better performance of re-healing alumina scale due to its possession of more beta phase as Al reservoir during the cyclic oxidation. The degradation process of the gradient coating was favorably retarded by the formation of Cr(W, Re)-rich precipitates in the interdiffusion zone. In sulphates, the two coatings showed good corrosion resistance. The presence of NaCl aggravated the corrosion extent of the two coatings. Compared with the conventional coating, the gradient coating postponed the formation of internal oxidation and sulfidation, resulting from the gradient distribution of Al-enriched outer layer and Cr-enriched inner layer.

TI Factors affecting the microstructure of platinum-modified aluminide
   coatings during a vapor phase aluminizing process
SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB Platinum (Pt)-modified aluminide coatings were developed by electroplating a thin layer of Pt followed by an industrial vapor phase aluminizing process. The goal of this work was to systematically investigate the effect of critical coating process parameters (such as the electroplated Pt thicknesses, Al contents in Cr-Al nuggets, diffusion heat treatments) and substrates on the final Pt-modified aluminide coatings. Surface morphology and cross-section microstructure of the developed coatings were inspected and compared by using Optical Microscope, Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). Experimental results showed that the Al and/or Pt increase shall favor the formation of xi-PtAl(2) phase; transformation of xi-PtAl(2) into beta-(Ni,Pt)Al phase can be obtained via a heat treatment process; Cr, Co elements in the studied Ni-base superalloy substrates did not show significant influence on coating outer layer microstructure; while substrate elements affect the microstructure of the coating interdiffusion layer.

TI Influence of surface treatment of bondcoat and yttrium in bondcoat on
   oxidation behavior of thermal barrier coatings
SO JOURNAL OF THE JAPAN INSTITUTE OF METALS
AB This paper focuses on the oxide layer formed at bondcoat/topcoat interface of thermal barrier coatings (TBCs), which grows faster in comparison with the oxide layer formed on overlay coatings, although both bondcoat and overlay coating are made of MCrAlY alloy (M is Ni or Co, or combination of Ni and Co). The authors clarify the influence of (D the surface treatment (shot peening) of bondcoat and (2) yttrium in bondcoat on the oxidation behavior of the thermal barrier coatings. Oxidation tests were carried out at 950 degrees C in air by means of TBC specimens. The specimen consists of Ni-base superalloy (Inconel738LC), CoNiCrAlY bondcoat and ZrO2-Y2O3 topcoat. In the TBC specimen with as-sprayed bondcoat, the oxide layer consisted of "wart-like oxide" and "continuous alumina layer". The wart-like oxide is caused due to un-melted particles of CoNiCrAlY alloy that remained at the bondcoat /topcoat interface in spraying process. The surface treatment of bondcoat prevented the formation of wart-like oxide because the unmelted particles were removed. In the TBC specimen with as-sprayed bondcoat, yttrium-rich oxide particles were included in the continuous alumina layer. The surface treatment of bondcoat and/or the removal of yttrium from the chemical composition of bondcoat in TBC specimen prevented the formation of the yttrium-rich oxide particles in the continuous oxide layer, and as a result, the growth of continuous alumina layer was decreased. There is a possibility that the application of the bondcoat without yttrium restrains the growth of the continuous oxide layer in TBC.

TI Oxidation behavior of Fe-Cr- and Ni-Cr-based alloy interconnects in
   CH4-H2O for solid oxide fuel cells
SO JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Oxide scale formations in CH4-H2O atmospheres were compared for different alloys as interconnects in solid oxide fuel cells (Fe-Cr and Ni-Cr alloys). Oxidation with anode gases (CH4, H2O, CO, and CO2) caused a relatively thick oxide scale formation on the alloy surfaces even in the low oxygen partial pressures at 1073 K. The distribution of elements in the oxide scale and the growth rates of oxide scales were precisely analyzed among the examined alloys by glow discharge optical emission spectrometry. Mn spinels formed on the top surface of oxide scales for both Fe-Cr and Ni-Cr alloys. Oxide scale thickness grew with annealing time by a parabolic relationship, and the growth rates were in the orders of 10(-6)-10(-5) mu m(2) s(-1) at 1073 K. Ni-Cr alloy shows relatively low growth rate compared with the Fe-Cr alloy. The electrical conductivity after forming oxide scales was different depending on the oxide scale phases and thickness, which was on the order of 10-100 S cm(-1) at 1073 K.

AB The effect of Nb on the properties and microstructure of two novel powder metallurgy (P/M) Ni-based superalloys was evaluated, and the results critically compared with the Rolls-Royce alloy RR1000. The Nb-containing alloy was found to exhibit improved tensile and creep properties as well as superior oxidation resistance compared with both RR1000 and the Nb-free variant tested. The beneficial effect of Nb on the tensile and creep properties was due to the microstructures obtained following the post-solution heat treatments, which led to a higher gamma' volume fraction and a finer tertiary gamma' distribution. In addition, an increase in the anti-phase-boundary energy of the gamma' phase is also expected with the addition of Nb, further contributing to the strength of the material. However, these modifications in the gamma' distribution detrimentally affect the dwell fatigue crack-growth behavior of the material, although this behavior can be improved through modified heat treatments. The oxidation resistance of the Nb-containing alloy was also enhanced as Nb is believed to accelerate the formation of a defect-free Cr2O3 scale. Overall, both developmental alloys, with and without the addition of Nb, were found to exhibit superior properties than RR1000.

AB Aeronautic gas turbine blades, vanes and combustion chambers are protected against high temperature oxidation and corrosion by single or multilayered coatings. These include environmental coatings, generally based on Pt-modified Ni aluminides or MCrAlY overlays (where M = Ni and/or Co), thermal barrier coating (TBC) systems including a ceramic thermally insulating layer, and abradable seals. The present work shows the ability of the Spark Plasma Sintering technique to rapidly develop new coatings compositions and microstructures. This technique allows combining powders and metallic foils on a superalloy substrate in order to obtain multilayered coatings in a single short production step. Fabrication of MCrAlY overlays with local Pt and/or Al enrichments is shown, as well as fabrication of coatings made of zeta-PtAl2, epsilon-PtAl, alpha-AlNiPt2, martensitic and beta-(Ni,Pt)Al or Pt-rich gamma/gamma' phases, including their doping with reactive elements. The fabrication of a complete TBC system with a porous and adherent Yttria Stabilized Zirconia (YSZ) layer on a bond-coating is also demonstrated, as well as the fabrication of a CoNiCrAlY-based cermet coating for abradable seal application. Difficulties of fabrication are reviewed, such as Y segregation, risks of carburization, local over-heating, or difficulty to coat complex shaped parts. Solutions are given to overcome these difficulties.

TI The preparation and hot corrosion resistance of gradient NiCoCrAlYSiB
   coatings
SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB An Al and Cr gradient NiCoCrAlYSiB coating was prepared by a two-step deposition: (i) deposition of a NiCoCrAlYSiB layer onto Ni-based superalloy surface by arc ion plating (AIP); and (ii) co-deposition of NiCoCrAlYSiB and Cr-Al by AIP and magnetron sputtering (MS), respectively. The results of EPMA show that Al and Cr have a gradient distribution in the surface layer of the gradient coatings. After annealing, the NiCoCrAlYSiB coatings consist of gamma/gamma' and beta-NiAl, while the gradient coatings consist of sigma-(Cr, Co), AlCr2, and Al8Cr5, besides gamma/gamma' and beta-NiAl. The phases of sigma-(Cr, Co), AlCr2, and Al8Cr5 can act as reservoir phases of Cr and Al to improve the hot corrosion resistance and lifetime of the coatings. In order to investigate the effect of Al and Cr on the hot corrosion of coatings, NiCoCrAlYSiB coatings and the gradient coatings were coated with 0.5 mg (Na2SO4+K2SO4 20 wt.% salt mixture)/cm(2) and oxidized at 900 degrees C for 20 h. XRD and EDS results show that there are only the alumina formed on the NiCoCrAlYSiB coatings, so the basic fluxing of Al2O3 occurred, which caused an accelerated hot corrosion after 10 h. For the gradient coatings, there formed Al2O3 and Cr2O3 at the primary stage of hot corrosion. Cr2O3 is easier to react with Na2SO4 than Al2O3, which reduces the oxygen ion activity of Na2SO4, so Al2O3 was protected. The formation of the continual and protective layer of Al2O3 and Cr2O3 leads to the hot corrosion kinetics of gradient coatings similar to oxidation kinetics. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

TI Comparison of thermal expansion and oxidation behavior of various
   high-temperature coating materials and superalloys
SO MATERIALS AT HIGH TEMPERATURES
AB The thermal expansion mismatch between a metallic substrate and its external oxide scale generates a strain on cooling that is a primary cause of spallation of protective oxide scales. This study compares thermal expansion behavior and cyclic oxidation performance of the two major composition classes of high-temperature commercial coatings for protection of single-crystal superalloys. The thermal expansion of cast MCrAlY (M = Ni and/or Co) alloys and cast aluminides (NiAl, (Ni,Pt)Al and Ni(3)Al) was measured at temperatures up to 1300degreesC and compared to that of a single-crystal Ni-base superalloy. The tendency for scale spallation from each alloy was evaluated by cyclic oxidation testing at 1150degreesC. The coefficients of thermal expansion for the aluminides were lower than those of the MCrAlY-based alloys at all temperatures and scale adherence to the Hf-doped aluminides was generally superior. Scale adherence to the various compositions of MCrAlY-type alloys did not directly correlate to their thermal expansion behavior or substrate strength. For both types of materials, the presence of a reactive element (Y,Hf, etc.) had no detectable effect on thermal expansion but a major effect on scale adherence. There was no obvious influence of At content on the thermal expansion of beta phase Ni-Al compositions. The addition of Pt resulted in a lower average thermal expansion for hyperstoichiometric (Ni,Pt)AI at temperatures above 930degreesC, but this effect was not observed in hypostoichiometric (Ni,Pt)AI.

TI High-Temperature Corrosion Behavior of Alloy 617 in Helium Environment
   of Very High Temperature Gas Reactor
SO KOREAN JOURNAL OF METALS AND MATERIALS
AB Alloy 617 is a Ni-base superalloy and a candidate material for the intermediate heat exchanger (IHX) of a very high temperature gas reactor (VHTR) which is one of the next generation nuclear reactors under development. The high operating temperature of VHTR enables various applications such as mass production of hydrogen with high energy efficiency. Alloy 617 has good creep resistance and phase stability at high temperatures in an air environment. However, it was reported that the mechanical properties decreased at a high temperature in an impure helium environment. In this study, high-temperature corrosion tests were carried out at 850 degrees C-950 degrees C in a helium environment containing the impurity gases H-2, CO, and CH4, in order to examine the corrosion behavior of Alloy 617. Until 250 h, Alloy 617 specimens showed a parabolic oxidation behavior at all temperatures. The activation energy for oxidation in helium environment was 154 kJ/mol. The SEM and EDS results elucidated a Cr-rich surface oxide layer, Al-rich internal oxides and depletion of grain boundary carbides. The thickness and depths of degraded layers also showed a parabolic relationship with time. A normal grain growth was observed in the Cr-rich surface oxide layer. When corrosion tests were conducted in a pure helium environment, the oxidation was suppressed drastically. It was elucidated that minor impurity gases in the helium would have detrimental effects on the high-temperature corrosion behavior of Alloy 617 for the VHTR application.

TI Sulfidation behavior of Inconel 738 superalloy at 500-900 degrees C
SO OXIDATION OF METALS
AB The high-temperature sulfidation behavior of the cast nickel-base superalloy Inconel 738 (IN-738) was studied over the temperature range 500-900 degreesC in pure sulfur vapor over the range 10(2)-10(4) Pa. The sulfidation kinetics followed the parabolic rate law in all cases. The sulfidation rates increased with increasing temperature and sulfur pressure. The scales formed were bilayered and temperature-dependent. At T less than or equal to 700 degreesC, the outer scale consisted of mostly NiS (with dissolved Co) and minor (CoS2 and NiCo2S4, while the inner layer was a heterophasic mixture of NiS, NiCo2S4, and minor amounts of Al2S3 and chromium sulfide (Cr2S3/Cr3S4) At T greater than or equal to 750 degreesC, the outer scale consisted of mostly Ni3S2 (With dissolved Ca) and minor amounts of Co3S4 and Cr2S3/ Cr3S4, while the inner layer was a complex, heterophasic mixture of Ni3S2, Cr2S3/Cr3S4, CoCr2S4, and minor Al2S3. Platinum markers were found to be located at the interface between the inner and outer scales, suggesting that the outer scale grew by the outward transport of cations and the inner scale grew by the inward transport of sulfur. The formation of Al2S3 and Cr2S3/Cr3S4 partly blocked the transport of cations through the inner scale and consequently reduced the sulfidation rates as compared to pure nickel.

AB At high operating temperatures the oxidation resistant MCrAlY (M=Ni, Co) coatings and the substrate alloys are highly susceptible to phase changes, particularly, after long hours of exposure, With the advent of computational modelling involving metallurgical thermodynamics and diffusion parameters in recent times, it is now possible to follow these phase changes and interdiffusion processes through simulation. In the present work, phase changes in the temperature range between 950 and 1050 degreesC in the MCrAlY coating materials containing additions of Cobalt and Rhenium have been determined through Such an approach. Further, using a diffusion simulation software interdiffusion between a commercial NiCoCrAlY coating and a Nickel-base superalloy substrate material at 1000 degreesC has been simulated. The simulated results have been compared with the experimental findings and they are found to be in reasonable agreement with each other. Some deviations observed are discussed in the light of limited availability of thermodynamic and kinetic data.

AB Interest in the integrated coal-gasification combined cycle plant (IGCC) has increased because of its high efficiency. However, degradation of gas turbine component materials has not been studied so far. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate the corrosion behaviors of these materials in an actual coal gas combustion environment. Our test facility was constructed near the coal-gasification test facility (CGT) at the Aioi works of Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co., Ltd. Several superalloy (Rene80H and FSX414) and coating systems (CoCrAlY, CoNiCrAlY and TBC) were exposed in the coal gas combustion environment at 1123, 1223 and 1323 K up to 350 h. After these tests, the weight change of each specimen was measured. Morphologies of products and element distributions at their surfaces were observed with SEM and EPMA. It is concluded that not only high- temperature oxidation and sulfidation but also ash deposition has a remarkable influence on the degradation of gas turbine blade materials.

TI Nanostructured intermetallics prepared by dealloying from single crystal
   nickel-based superalloys
SO INTERMETALLICS
AB Two-nanostructure intermetallics (nanoporous film and nanocube) on single crystal nickel-based superalloys were fabricated by electrochemical dealloying in an aqueous electrolyte containing 1 wt% (NH4)(2)SO4 and 1 wt% citric acid solution respectively. Electrochemical properties of two phases in single crystal nickel-based superalloys are different, and it has been utilized to dissolve preferentially gamma matrix phase and gamma' phase remains passive. The electrochemical corrosion behavior of a Ni-based superalloy after high temperature creep was investigated using an EG&G PAR M273 potentiostat. The results indicated that the microstructure after high temperature creep determined the morphology of the resultant gamma' phase intermetallics after dealloying. The morphologies and structure of nanoporous film and nanocube were characterized using a JSM-6700 (Japan) field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) and JEM-3010 high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM).

TI Corrosion evaluation of alloys and MCrAlX coatings in molten carbonates
   for thermal solar applications
SO SOLAR ENERGY MATERIALS AND SOLAR CELLS
AB Stainless steels (SS) 310, 321, 347, Incoloy 800H (In800H), alumina-forming austenitic (AFA-OC6), Ni superalloy Inconel 625 (IN625), and MCrAIX (M: Ni, and/or Co; X: Y, Hf, Si, and/or Ta) coatings were corroded in molten carbonates in N-2 and bone-dry CO2 atmospheres. Electrochemical tests in molten eutectics K2CO3-Na2CO3 and Na2CO3-K2CO3-Li2CO3 at temperatures higher than 600 degrees C were evaluated using an open-circuit potential followed by a potentiodynamic polarization sweep to determine the corrosion rates. Because the best-performing alloys at 750 degrees C were In800H followed by SS310, these two alloys were selected as the substrate material for the MCrAIX coatings. The coatings were able to mitigate corrosion in molten carbonates environments. The corrosion of substrates SS310 and In800H was reduced from similar to 2500 mu m/year to 34 mu m/year when coated with high-velocity oxyfuel (HVOF) NiCo-CrAlHfSiY and pre-oxidized (air, 900 degrees C, 24 h, 0.5 degrees C/min) before molten carbonate exposure at 700 degrees C in bone-dry CO2 atmosphere. Metallographic characterization of the corroded surfaces showed that the formation of a uniform alumina scale during the pre-oxidation seems to protect the alloy from the molten carbonate attack.

TI Microstructure and lifetime of Hf or Zr doped sputtered NiAlCr bond
   coat/7YSZ EB-PVD TBC systems
SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB NiAlCr-X overlay coatings deposited by magnetron sputtering on IN100 and CMSX-4 superalloys and thereafter top-coated with 7YSZ thermal barrier coatings by EB-PVD were investigated with emphasis on the effects of superalloy type and Hf or Zr doping. The sputtered films in the "as coated" condition (after EB-PVD deposition) showed strong diffusion effects of different elements from the superalloys. The measured phase content of beta and gamma' was in good agreement with calculated data obtained from experimental compositions normalized to a Ni-Al-Cr system following the guidelines of site preference of ternary alloying elements. Microstructure evolution and failure characteristics after furnace cyclic tests at 1100 degrees C were investigated as well. The lifetime of the coatings is equivalent to standard MCrAlY TBCs systems and is compared to PtAl and NiCoCrAlY coatings from literature. The effects of microstructure and elements diffusing from the substrates into the bond coat (Ti, Co, Mo and Ta) in combination with the effect of Hf- or Zr-doping is presented and discussed.

TI Microstructural modelling solution for complex Co based alloys and
   coatings
SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB Microstructural changes following oxidation at high temperatures of a complex coating or alloy can significantly influence its properties. This paper investigates possible solutions that can accurately model alloy microstructures that result from such a process in a cobalt-rich CoNiCrAIReY bond coat alloy system. Four different alloys with varying aluminum content were studied after heat treatments at 1000 degrees C or 1150 degrees C. SEM, EPMA and XRD were used to characterize the alloy microstructure, and hardness testing was performed to determine the role of microstructure on mechanical properties. Experimental microstructures were modeled using two databases of Thermo-Calc, namely TTNI8 and SSOL5. Effects of Al content on phase changes and materials properties were quantitatively investigated. Data showed that a 1 wt. % increase of Al in the alloy caused an 8% increase in the beta phase, and a Cr and Re rich sigma phase precipitated preferentially at high Al concentrations. In addition, alloy hardness was found to increase by 4 and 81%, respectively, with a 10% increase in the beta and sigma phases. Modeled results using the TTNI8 database showed excellent agreement with experimental observations, but the SSOL5 database produced erroneous information. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The oxidation behavior of Pt+Hf-modified gamma-Ni + gamma'-Ni(3)Al alloys containing up to 20 at.% Pt and either 15 or 20 at.% Al was studied by oxidizing the alloys in air at 1150 degrees C under both isothermal and thermal cycling conditions. It was found that the co-addition of Pt and Hf was extremely beneficial to oxidation resistance, to the extent that Ni-20Al-20Pt-Hf` and Ni-20Al-10Pt-Hf alloys (all compositions are in at.%) oxidized at significantly slower rates than that of a Ni-50Al-15Pt beta-NiAl alloy. A Ni-20Al-5Pt-Hf alloy also showed good oxidation resistance, with the steady-state oxidation rate being almost the same as that obtained for the beta alloy. Over a period of up to 500 one-hour oxidation cycles, no oxide spallation from the modified gamma+gamma' alloys was observed. From cross-sectional SEM examination coupled with X-ray diffraction analyses, it was found that a compact and planar exclusive scale layer of alpha-Al(2)O(3) formed on the Ni-20Al-20Pt-Hf alloy. By contrast, the Ni-20Al-10Pt-Hf and Ni-20Al-5Pt-Hf alloys formed a very thin outer layer of NiAl(2)O(4) and a planar inner layer of alpha-Al(2)O(3). The thickness of the inner Al(2)O(3) layer increased with increasing oxidation time relative to that of the NiAl(2)O(4) layer, meaning that the latter primarily formed during the initial stages of scale formation. Both NiO and NiAl(2)O(4) were found in the scales formed on the Ni-20Al-Hf and Ni-15Al-0 similar to 10Pt-Hf alloys, with the thickness of these oxide layers decreasing with increasing Pt content in the alloys. Further, it was found that the extent of internal HfO(2) formation decreased significantly with increasing Pt content, to the extent that no HfO(2) was found in the oxidized Ni-20Al-20Pt-Hf alloy. Inferences for the observed beneficial effects of Pt promoting protective Al(2)O(3) formation and decreasing the tendency for Hf to oxidize in gamma+gamma' alloys are discussed.

It was found that the co-addition of Pt and Hf was extremely beneficial to oxidation resistance, to the extent that Ni-20Al-20Pt-0.4Hf and Ni-20Al-10Pt0.4Hf alloys (all compositions are in at%) oxidized at significantly slower rates than that of a Ni-50Al-15Pt beta-NiAl alloy. A Ni-20A1-5Pt-0.3Hf alloy also showed relatively good oxidation resistance, with the oxidation rate being almost the same as that obtained for Ni-50Al-15Pt alloy. Over a period of up to 500 one-hour oxidation cycles, no oxide spallation from the modified gamma + gamma' alloys was observed. From cross-sectional SEM examination coupled with X-ray diffraction analyses, it was found that a compact and planar exclusive scale layer of alpha-Al2O3 formed on the Ni-20Al-20Pt-0.4Hf alloy. By contrast, Ni-20Al-10Pt-0.4Hf and Ni-20Al-5Pt-0.3Hf alloys formed a very thin outer layer of NiAl2O4 and a planar inner layer of of alpha-Al2O3. The thickness of this inner Al2O3 layer increased with increasing oxidation time relative to that of the NiAl2O4 layer, suggesting that the latter primarily formed during the initial stages of scale formation. Both NiO and NiAl2O4 were found in the outer scales formed on the Ni-20Al-0.3Hf and Ni-15Al-0 similar to 10Pt-M alloys, with the thickness of these oxide layers decreasing with increasing Pt content in the alloys. Further, it was found that the extent of internal HfO2 formation decreased significantly with increasing in Pt content, to the extent that no HfO2 was found in the oxidized Ni-20Al-20Pt-0.4Hf alloy.

AB The oxidation behavior in air at 1473 K, and sulfidation behavior in a H2S-H-2 gas mixture with a sulfur partial pressure of 10(-2) Pa at 973 K of Al-Re coated CMSX-4 were studied. Investigation on the sulfidation behavior of the Re-coated CMSX-4 was carried out in a H2S-H-2 gas mixture with a sulfur partial pressure of 10(-2) Pa at 973 K The experimental results show that a Re-rich alloy layer was formed between an alpha -Al2O3 layer and the inner concentration bone of Ta and Ti for the CMSX-4 single crystal alloy with an AI-Re coating after oxidation. The Re-rich alloy layer containing Cr, W, Ni, Co, and Alo effectively inhibited the outward diffusion of alloying elements and the inward diffusion of AL The Al/Re-coated CMSX-4 single crystal alloy had excellent sulfidation resistance; the Re-rich alloy layer, containing W, Ti, Ta, and Mo, which formed during the sulfidation process and located between the alumina scale and the CMSX-4 base alloy, plays a role in inhibiting the outward diffusion of alloying elements. The sulfidation resistance of CMSX-4 single-crystal alloy is greatly improved by a Re coating on the CMSX-4 alloy surface; this is attributed to a Re-Cr-W alloy layer that retarded the outward diffusion of cations and the oxide layer containing Ta, Ti, and Al, which inhibited the inward penetration of sulfur.

TI Prospect of nickel-based superalloys with low Cr and high Re contents
SO ISIJ INTERNATIONAL
AB There is a clear trend of lowering Cr and increasing Re content in the evolution from the 1st- to the 2nd- and to the 3rd-generation Ni-based single crystal (SC) superalloys. Following this trend, two groups of superalloys were made with the aid of the d-electrons concept. One is the A-group which is characterized by the lower Cr and the higher Re contents in the alloys than in the 3rd-generation SC alloys. A homogeneous microstructure was obtained in these A-group superalloys containing 0, 1 and 2 mass% Cr, while their Re and Co contents were set at about 8.5 mass% and 13.5 mass% respectively. The other is the B-group which is characterized by the lower Re content than the A-group. Three alloys in the B-group containing 2.5, 4.2 and 12.1 mass% Cr were studied for the comparison with the A-group. According to a hot corrosion test, weight gain occurred in a Cr-free alloy instead of observing weight loss in Cr containing alloys. Hot corrosion resistance of 2 mass% Cr alloy was quite good as long as the alloy contains about 8.5 mass% Be. The oxidation resistance was improved remarkably in 1 mass% Cr alloy than in the Cr-free alloy. It was found that the addition of at least 2 mass% Cr into superalloys is necessary in order to keep good surface stability at high temperatures. Also, it was seen that Re is a harmful element for oxidation resistance.

Elastic modulus, hardness, creep exponent, creep strain rate and thermal activation volume of the different alloy 617 samples were studied through nanoindentation method. Indentation size effect (ISE) was studied in terms of hardness variation as a function of loading depth and temperature. Three-point bending tests for in-situ crack tip stress measurements were performed on the samples with an initial crack to measure crack tip plastic stresses under applied load. A relation between indentation depth and hardness was used to predict strain gradient length scale variation from 1.008 mu m at room temperature and to 1.876 mu m at 673 K then decreasing to 1.228 mu m at 1073 K.

AB Long-term 1093 K heat treatments of three commercial superalloy sheet materials were undertaken in air and vacuum. With either exposure, significant precipitation of second phases occurred in the Co-base Haynes(R) Alloy 188 (HA 188) and the Ni-base Haynes(R) Alloy 230 (HA 230); however, much less precipitation was found in the exposed Ni-base alloy Inconel(R) 617 (IN 617). Although some grain growth occurred in HA 188, no changes in the grain size of either RA 230 or IN 617 were observed after 22,500 h at temperature. Oxidation during air heat treatments led to weight gain due to the formation of chromia + spinel scales and surface-connected grain boundary pits/oxides in all three superalloys. Both the weight gain and depth of intergranular attack were dependent on the square root of time, which is indicative of diffusion-controlled phenomena. Because many alloy samples had neighbors in close proximity, most vacuum heat treated specimens did not suffer significant loss of volatile elements. However, some exposed samples were subjected to unrestricted vacuum heat treatments, allowing estimates of volatilization to be made. Based on the data for HA 188, the weight loss during 1093 K vacuum exposure was diffusion controlled once the inhibiting effects of surface films on the as-received alloys were broken down.

TI Mechanism of void formation in grain interior of ODS alloys
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB The mechanism of the void formation in the grain interior of ODS alloy PM2000 was investigated by an internal friction technique. A relaxation peak with a relaxation characteristic was observed around 770 degrees C, and average activation energy for the relaxation peak is approximately 2.70 +/- 0.16 eV, which is consistent with that of self-diffusion in delta-ferrite. Internal friction study has substantiated the existence of the interfacial diffusional relaxation of the stress concentrations in the single crystal ODS alloy. The micrographic results indicate that the actual shape for the voids, which co-exist with the oxide particles in the voids, is ellipsoidal. Taking account of the correlation of the interfacial diffusional relaxation with the ellipsoidal shape of voids, it is suggested that the void formation in grain interior is attributed to the relaxation of the stress-concentration gradients introduced by extrusion deformation via interfacial diffusion.

AB There are over 1000 biomass boilers and about 500 plants using waste as fuel in Europe, and the numbers are increasing. Many of them encounter serious problems with high-temperature corrosion due to detrimental elements such as chlorides, alkali metals, and heavy metals. By HVOF spraying, it is possible to produce very dense and well-adhered coatings, which can be applied for corrosion protection of heat exchanger surfaces in biomass and waste-to-energy power plant boilers. Four HVOF coatings and one arc sprayed coating were exposed to actual biomass co-fired boiler conditions in superheater area with a probe measurement installation for 5900 h at 550 and 750 degrees C. The coating materials were Ni-Cr, IN625, Fe-Cr-W-Nb-Mo, and Ni-Cr-Ti. CJS and DJ Hybrid spray guns were used for HVOF spraying to compare the corrosion resistance of Ni-Cr coating structures. Reference materials were ferritic steel T92 and nickel super alloy A263. The circulating fluidized bed boiler burnt a mixture of wood, peat and coal. The coatings showed excellent corrosion resistance at 550 degrees C compared to the ferritic steel. At higher temperature, NiCr sprayed with CJS had the best corrosion resistance. IN625 was consumed almost completely during the exposure at 750 degrees C.

TI STUDY OF OXIDATION BEHAVIOR OF THE GRADIENT NiCrAlY COATING AT 1000 AND
   1100 degrees C
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB MCrAlY(M=Ni and/or Co) overlay coatings are wildly adopted on hot components in gas turbine engines to protect them from rapid oxidation. Various methods can be applied to prepare MCrAlY overlay coatings, which formed by the arc ion plating method possess outstanding properties in terms of interfacial strength, porosity and componential distribution, and thus excellent oxidation properties. To increase the Al content is deemed art economical and effective solution for enhancing the service performance and life for MCrAlY coatings at elevated temperature because the degradation process relies greatly on the ceaseless forming and spallation process of the protective alpha-Al2O3 scales during high-temperature oxidation. However, high content of Al will lower the melting point and decrease the ductility of the coating. This phenomenon can be partly resolved through a gradient coating design. In this paper, a conventional NiCrAlY coating and a gradient NiCrAlY coating have been prepared by the combined method of arc ion plating and subsequent diffusion treatment on Ni-base superalloy substrate. The microstructures, morphologies, isothermal oxidation behavior at 1000 and 1100 degrees C and cyclic oxidation behavior at 1100 degrees C have been investigated on the two kinds of the coatings. The results have revealed that the conventional NiCrAlY coating with uniform components is composed of gamma'/gamma phase, beta-NiAl phase and some alpha-Cr precipitate phase. While the gradient NiCrAlY coating have showed layered microstructure, i.e., an Al-enriched outer layer and a Cr-enriched inner layer, primarily consists of beta-NiAl phase, gamma'/gamma phase and some alpha-Cr precipitate phase in the outer layer. During the oxidation, it is evident that the vanishment of beta-NiAl phase and the enlargement of gamma'/gamma phase for both the coatings. Nevertheless, the gradient coating has maintained higher Al content during long-term oxidation due to the massive beta-NiAl phase obtained in the outer layer after vacuum annealing and the Cr(W) zones precipitated beside the Cr-enriched inner layer during the oxidation. Adequate beta-NiAl phase, as reservoir phase of Al, directly delay the process of Al depletion; Cr(W) zones, to a certain extent, slow down the degradation by hindering the diffusion of Al from the gradient coating to the substrate. As a result, the ability of forming and healing the protective alpha-Al2O3 scales in the gradient coating have been enhanced, which has eventually improved the high-temperature oxidation properties.

TI Hot corrosion behavior of HVOF-sprayed Cr3C2-WC-NiCoCrMo coating
SO CERAMICS INTERNATIONAL
AB A novel binary carbide-based sprayed powder, consisting of hard phases (Cr3C2, WC) and matrix phase (NiCoCrMo), was designed to ensure the harsh environments (corrosion, wear, and high temperature) of power plant boilers. A Cr3C2-WC-NiCoCrMo coating was deposited by high-velocity oxygen-fuel (HVOF) process using an agglomerated and sintered Cr3C2-WC-NiCoCrMo powder with a particle size of -45+15 mu m. Hot-corrosion tests were performed under cyclic conditions using a NaCl-KCI-Na2SO4 salt environment, at temperatures up to 500 degrees C. High-temperature oxidation was performed at 500 degrees C. For comparison, corrosion and oxidation tests were also performed on a commercial Cr3C2-25(NiCr) coating, and the corrosion resistance was evaluated by measuring the thickness of the corrosion scale. The properties of the specimens were characterized using X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive spectroscopy. The Cr3C2-WC-NiCoCrMo and Cr3C2-25(NiCr) coatings exhibited similar oxidation-resistance properties. The Cr3C2-WC-NiCoCrMo coating exhibited superior corrosion resistance to that of the Cr3C2-25(NiCr) coating. In the case of the Cr3C2-WC-NiCoCrMo coating, the thickness of the corrosion scale was approximately one-third that of the Cr3C2-25(NiCr) coating. The hot-corrosion resistance imparted by the Cr3C2-WC-NiCoCrMo coating may be attributed to the formation of alloy phases during the powder and coating manufacturing process, as well as to the formation of Cr, W, Ni, Co and Mo oxides, and Ni and Cr spinels.

AB Microstructural changes, damage initiation and spallation Of a production TBC, which consists of: an electron beam physical vapor deposited ZrO2-7 wt.% Y2O3 (YSZ); thermally grown oxide (TGO); MCrAlY bond coat; and a polycrystalline IN-738 superalloy substrate, were examined as a function of thermal cycles at 1121 degreesC. Thermal cycling for TBC specimens in air consisted of a 10-min heat-up, a 40-min hold at 1121 degreesC and a 10-min quench. Microstructural characterization was carried out by: photo-stimulated luminescence piezo-spectroscopy (PLPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD). scanning electron microscopy (SEM); and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). Development of microstructure in the YSZ coatings, growth of the thermally grown oxide (TGO) and its constituents. and phase transformations in the MCrAlY bond coat were examined as a function of thermal cycles. Instability of the TGO/bond coat interface (i.e. rumpling), leading to localized cracking at the YSZ/TGO interface and within the YSZ, was observed after as few as five thermal cycles. Spallation of YSZ coatings occurred after approximately 400 cycles. Significant void formation at the TGO/bond coat interface and formation of a Ni/Co rich oxides at the TGO/bond coat interface due to rapid internal oxidation of Al-depleted MCrAlY bond coat were strong contributors to spallation failure of the TBC. The final spallation of TBC results from a 'link-up' of damage at the TGO/bond coat interface with the rumpling-induced micro-cracking at the YSZ/TGO interface. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

TI Effects of deposition temperature on the kinetics growth and protective
   properties of aluminide coatings
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Chemical vapor aluminizing is a major production technique used for producing aluminide coatings on gas turbine blades to form dense and adhesive alumina surface layers and further prolong their service lives at high temperature. A chemical vapor deposited aluminizing process had been employed to deposit nickel aluminide coatings under the different deposition temperature. The phase structure, morphology, chemical composition, kinetics growth mechanism and oxidation/corrosion behavior of the aluminide coatings were studied in detail. The results show that the phase structure, microstructure and composition of the aluminide coatings are strongly influenced by the deposition temperature during chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The higher is the deposition temperature, the easier is the formation of pure beta-NiAl phase. Along with the increment of the deposition temperature, the coatings' surface will become smooth and dense, while the ridges along grain boundaries can be simultaneously approach to flat in a certain extend. Large numbers of elements of Cr, Mo and W within diffusion zone that could probably form a thin film layer, which is usually so-called as diffusion barrier. The key step of growth of coating grain is the formation of a volatile aluminium subhalide by controlling of the suitable deposition temperature during CVD. Based on the results of isothermal oxidation and hot corrosion kinetics curves, the best deposition parameter can be gained among the four coatings when the deposition temperature is adopted to be 1323 K.

TI ONE-STEP DEPOSITION AND INTERFACIAL ADHESIVE STRENGTH OF THE MULTILAYER
   SYSTEM WITH A DIFFUSION BARRIER
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB M-Cr-Al-Y (M=Ni and/or Co) coatings with the good comprehensive property among anti-oxidation, anti-corrosion and mechanical properties have been widely used for the protection for the gas turbine components. However, after a long-term thermal exposure to high temperature atmosphere in service, the coatings are rapidly degraded. The main cause is ascribed to the intensive element interdiffusion between the coating and the substrate. To suppress the interdiffusion, addition of a diffusion barrier (DB) is required at the interface of the overlayer and the substrate. However, M-Cr-Al-Y coating system with a ceramic diffusion barrier prepared by a conventional two-step arc ion plating (AIP) on the superalloy substrate would reduce the interfacial adhesive strength. In this paper, the multilayer system of Ni-Cr-Al-Y-Si overlayer with a DB and a bond coat (BC) was deposited on the DSM11 substrate by one-step AIP. The anti-oxidation property, the anti-diffusion ability of the barrier and the interfacial adhesive strength of the multilayer system were investigated. The results indicate that the multilayer can provide more effective protection for the DSM11 substrate than the single coating at high temperature. After 100 h thermal exposure at 1050 degrees C. the surface Al2O3 scales are continuous, dense, and only very little amounts of alloy elements diffused from the substrate is detected in the overlayer. After 100 cyc cycles between 1050 degrees C and room temperature (RT), the barrier layer has still well adhesive to the overlayer and the substrate. The tensile adhesion test shows that the interfacial adhesive strength is 63.6 MPa for the annealed multilayer system, which is about 20 MPa higher than that of the coating system with a DB on the DSM11 substrate deposited by the two-step AIP. The one-step AIP method can increase the interfacial adhesive strength and improve the anti-oxidation performance of the multilayer with DB.

TI Selection and evaluation of heat-resistant alloys for SOFC interconnect
   applications
SO JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Over the past several years, advances in the design and fabrication of planar solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) have led to a steady reduction in the temperatures necessary for their operation. Consequently, it appears more realistic now to use low cost heat-resistant alloys for interconnect components in the SOFC stack. However, no specific criteria or inclusive study are available as a reference to help select and evaluate suitable candidates from the hundreds of available heat-resistant alloy compositions, which overall demonstrate oxidation resistance at high temperatures. In this work, composition criteria have been proposed for the preselection of heat-resistant compositions, such as Ni-, Fe-, and Co-based superalloys, Cr-based alloys, and stainless steels. The proposed criteria have been employed to establish a database of heat-resistant alloys at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, where a systematic approach has been initiated to evaluate and modify and/or develop alloys for SOFC interconnect applications. The preselected compositions are further evaluated by referring in-house studies and reference to published data. It appears that it would be difficult for traditional alloys to fully satisfy the materials requirements for long-term operation at temperatures higher than 700degreesC. However, the applicability can be improved via surface/bulk modification and by the implementation of novel stack designs. (C) 2003 The Electrochemical Society.

TI Protective pre-deposited slurry dip-coating alumina layer on TBC system
SO MATERIALS AND CORROSION-WERKSTOFFE UND KORROSION
AB In the present study, a thin intermediate protective -alumina layer was pre-deposited by slurry dip-coating technique on APS-CoNiCrAlY bond coat prior depositing APS-YSZ as top coat. The alumina layer acts as barrier for oxygen diffusion to protect the metallic bond coat from excessive oxidation. The new TBC was compared with the standard TBC system which comprises of Ni-superalloy substrate, CoNiCrAlY bond coat and YSZ top coat concerning the behavior under thermal cycling at 1150 degrees C. The samples were investigated before and after thermal cycling by optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) equipped with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD). Image analysis was used to compare between the microstructure by measuring the crack lengths and the thermally grown oxide layer (TGO) average thickness after thermal cycling. It was observed that a more uniform and compact -Al2O3 TGO was formed in the new TBC system after thermal cycling comparing to the commercial one. It was, also, found that the alumina intermediate layer has the potential to reduce the length of the cracks and the average thickness of TGO by suppressing the detrimental mixed oxides, like Cr2O3, CoO, NiO, and (Ni, Co)(Cr, Al)(2)O-4, thus, improving the TBC durability.

TI Gradient thermal cycling behavior of a thermal barrier coating system
   constituted by NiCoCrAlY bond coat and pure metastable tetragonal
   nano-4YSZ top coat
SO CERAMICS INTERNATIONAL
AB Pure metastable tetragonal (t') phase 4YSZ top coats with thickness of 100 and 200 mu m were deposited on NiCoCrAlY-coated second generation single crystal superalloy by air plasma spray (APS). The two thermal barrier coatings were evaluated under gradient thermal cycling test using gas mixture of propane and oxygen. After flame shock test, the values of Young's modulus, hardness and degree of densification all exhibited a gradient distribution across YSZ thickness. In contrast to intensive sintering at surface of 200 mu m 4YSZ coating, the TBC sample with 4YSZ layer of 100 mu m underwent poor oxidation at interface of YSZ and bond coat, forming a duplex oxide scale: (Ni,Co)(Cr,Al)(2)O-4 spinet over Al2O3, which promoted the delamination at the top-coat/bond-coat interface. The resistance against gradient thermal cycling, the phase stability of 4YSZ and the failure mechanism of the TBCs, were discussed correlating to the effects of YSZ thickness.

TI Fatigue crack growth mechanisms in superalloys: overview
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Fatigue studies on disc and blade nickel based superalloys by the author and co-workers are reviewed. Crack initiation in single crystal turbine blade alloys is dominated by interdendritic porosity with oxidation processes affecting initiation position. Lifetime trends can be modelled using a multipart Paris type lifing approach. Orientation, loading state, temperature and environment determine stage I/II crack growth mechanisms and the resulting crack path and should be considered in lifing. Mechanistic insights on how complex stress states, subsurface failures and different temperatures/environments affect fatigue processes can thus improve turbine blade lifing, and direct alloy development programmes. In polycrystalline disc alloys cracks at high temperature may initiate at oxidised subsurface carbides or porosity. Grain size controls cycle and time dependent crack growth: the benefits of increased grain size in resisting grain boundary attack mechanisms predominate over those of gamma' distribution variation. Optimising grain boundary character and distribution should yield the best alloy design strategy for high temperature fatigue performance in turbine discs.

TI Enhancement of hot corrosion resistance of thermal barrier coatings by
   using nanostructured Gd2Zr2O7 coating
SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB Improvement of hot corrosion resistance in Na2SO4-V2O5 environments is one of the main goals in development of thermal barrier coatings (TBCs). In this study, nano-Gd2Zr2O7 (nano-GZ) powder was synthesized by co precipitation method and then deposited with atmospheric plasma spray (APS) technique on Ni-based superalloy (IN738LC) substrates as a top coat with a CoNiCrAIY bond coat. Hot corrosion behavior of nano-GZ coated samples were studied and compared with those of CoNiCrAlY/conventional YSZ coatings. Hot corrosion resistance of the samples was investigated in a cyclic mode in which after each 4 h exposure to Na2SO4-55 wt% V2O5 salts at 950 degrees C. The results indicated that nano-GZ coatings have better hot corrosion resistance compared to conventional YSZ coatings. It was found that micro-cracks and pores played a main role in the molten salts infiltration into the TBC5 during hot corrosion process. In the nano-GZ coating with nano zones structure which surrounded by fully molten parts could fill the aforementioned defects and could act as barrier for the corrosive molten salts penetration into the TBC. The main factor in destruction of the investigated coatings is the formation and growth of needle-like YVO4 and GdVO4 crystals, in both classes of the coatings.

TI The development of new bond coat compositions for thermal barrier
   coating systems operating under industrial gas turbine conditions
SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB Environmental and economic issues are driving the development of increasingly efficient gas turbines. An important step in achieving this is to engineer components which can operate with longer lifetimes and at higher metal temperatures. Inlet temperatures for gas turbines now exceed the melting temperatures of nickel-based superalloys (i.e. 1300-1350 degrees C). The use of advanced air cooling systems coupled with thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) reduces the temperature of the underlying superalloy substrate. The bond coating, an important part of the TBC system, oxidizes to form a slow growing protective oxide layer, while also providing adhesion between the ceramic topcoat and the substrate. NiCoCrAlY overlay coatings are some of the most commonly used bond coatings for industrial gas turbines and extensive research has been undertaken over many years to find the best bond coating composition.
   This paper reports upon the production of new, model bond coatings with a wide range of different compositions. The focus is on their oxidation behavior at a temperature typically experienced by bond coatings on industrial turbine blades (950 degrees C). A physical vapor deposition technique, magnetron sputtering, has been used to deposit a range of Ni-Co-Cr-Al coatings onto 10 mm diameter sapphire substrates. This was achieved through co-sputtering two targets: a Ni-10%Cr, Ni-20%Cr, Ni-50%Cr, Ni-20%Co-40%Cr or Ni-40%Co-20%Cr target and a pure Al target. About a hundred samples with varying compositions were produced by this method. The coatings were then oxidized in air for 500 h at 950 degrees C.
   All samples were assessed by measuring the change in coating thickness, using pre- and post-exposure metrology only, and also the change in specimen weight. This approach has shown that magnetron sputtering successfully deposited 20 to 30 mu m thick coatings and allowed the calculation of oxide growth rates. Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis was used to characterize the exact composition of each sample. Additionally, Xray diffraction (XRD) has been used to identify the major oxides formed during exposure. The selective growth of protective Cr2O3 or Al2O3 or other less protective mixed oxides (depending on the initial coating composition) was observed. This influenced the oxide scale growth rate, indicating which coatings produced more protective oxides and allowing future optimization of the bond coating composition, for service within the turbine section of industrial gas turbines to be planned.

AB Thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) are now currently used in gas turbine engines' blades and vanes. A typical duplex TBCs system comprises of a plasma-sprayed thermally insulating ZrO2 alloy top coat applied over an oxidation-resistant MCrAlY (M=Ni and/or Co) bond coat. In this investigation, the substrates of Hastelloy-X superalloy coupons were first sprayed with a Ni-22Cr-10Al-1Y bond coat and then with an yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) top coat in which the yttria contents were varied from 6.1 wt.% to 19.5 wt.%. After that, the plasma-sprayed yttria-stabilized zirconia/MCrAlY TBCs were glazed using a pulsed CO, laser. The hot corrosion resistance of plasma-sprayed and laser-glazed zirconia thermal barrier coatings at 910 degrees C was investigated using coupons on which were deposited Na2SO4 and/or V2O5. The results of the high temperature corrosion tests showed that the lifetimes of the plasma-sprayed TBCs with different yttria content were all increased about fourfold by laser-glazing in the V2O5 salt contained test. The lifetime decreased with increasing the amount of deposited V2O5 salt. The X-ray diffraction showed that the reaction between yttria (Y2O3) and V2O5 produced YVO4, leaching Y2O3 from the YSZ and causing progressive cubic, tetragonal to monoclinic phase destabilization transformation. The failure of the TBCs was initiated and propagated mainly within the top coat, near the top coat-bond coat interface. Both adding Na2SO4 and a reaction between Na2SO4 and the bond coat can probably reduce the strain accommodation of the top coat. There are no significant corrosion cyclic life differences for TBC with various YSZ top coats for both plasma-sprayed and laser-glazed TBC. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Effect of high-temperature protective coatings on fatigue lives of
   nickel-based superalloys
SO FATIGUE & FRACTURE OF ENGINEERING MATERIALS & STRUCTURES
AB This study concerns MCrAlY coatings (M is Ni, Co or both) sprayed by a vacuum plasma spraying process for protection against high-temperature corrosion and oxidation of gas turbine components, such as turbine blades and duct segments. The effect of high-temperature protective coatings on fatigue lives of nickel-based superalloys were investigated at high temperature under push-pull loading and rotary bending and then compared with uncoated superalloys, such as equiaxed IN738LC, unidirectional solidified CM247LC and single-crystal CMSX-2. The high-cycle fatigue lives of MCrAlY-coated superalloys at high temperature under push-pull loading showed an inferior performance when compared with the uncoated superalloys. This was because the crack initiation site was different. The high-cycle fatigue cracks of nickel-based superalloys initiated at casting cavities which were exposed on the specimen surface, whereas the high-cycle fatigue cracks of MCrAlY-coated specimens initiated at interface defects, such as small pores and grid residue, between the MCrAlY coating and the substrate and grew into the MCrAlY coating, and then into the substrate. Similarly, the rotary bending fatigue properties of MCrAlY-coated superalloys at high temperature showed an inferior performance when compared with the uncoated superalloys. This is because of a high stress due to the higher Young's modulus of the MCrAlY coating (in comparison with the substrate) being induced at the MCrAlY coating surface. The crack initiation site was on the specimen surface in both cases of the nickel-based superalloys and the MCrAlY-coated superalloys, respectively. As a result, it was considered that, for rotary bending tests, the fatigue life reduction was due to the high stress that originated from the difference of elastic constants between the MCrAlY coating and the superalloy. Consequently, in fatigue life design it is necessary to take account of the stress levels in a coating layer.

AB MCrAlY type (M = Ni and/or Co) coatings are widely used for the protection of components in the hot sections of gas turbines at high service temperatures by forming a continuous alpha-alumina. A reliable criterion to estimate the capability of coating to form alpha-alumina is of great importance to accurately evaluate coating lifetime. However, some coatings retain the ability to form a continuous alpha-alumina scale when the concentration of Al in coatings decreases to a critical level, therefore, the empirical Al-concentration based criterion is inadequate to properly predict the formation of a continuous alpha-alumina. Thus, a new life criterion, namely the critical Al-activity criterion, is proposed.
   In this work, the critical Al-activity to form a continuous a-alumina was validated by Al-activity calculation using Thermo-Calc software based on survey of research results of critical Al-concentration to form alpha-alumina on binary Ni-Al and ternary Ni-Cr-Al systems. Long-term oxidation tests were performed to support the criterion: three different MCrAlY coatings coated on IN-792 superalloy substrates were oxidized at 1000 degrees C for various periods of time up to 10,000 h. The microstructural evolution of MCrAlY coatings was investigated using Scanning Electron Microscope. The near-surface Al concentration and interdiffusion behaviour between substrate and coating were measured using Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy. The new critical Al-activity criterion has been successfully adopted in alpha-alumina formation prediction, showing a good agreement with experiment results. Therefore, it can be concluded that the extrapolation of new criterion from binary and ternary systems to multi-alloyed MCrAlY system is reasonable. Furthermore, the partial pressure of oxygen (P-O2) in atmosphere has been taken into consideration by combination with Al-activity to calculate the critical chemical reaction constant (K) of formation of a-alumina. The potential applicability of the methodology to predict MCrAlY life is also discussed.

TI Synergetic effects of impurities and alloying element Cr on oxidation
   and dissolution corrosion of Ni (111) surfaces: A DFT study
SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Using density-functional calculations, we studied the interactions between interstitial impurities (H, O, N, S, and P) and Ni (111) surfaces doped, or not, with Cr, and studied the effect of Cr doping on the dissolution corrosion resistance of Ni(111) surfaces. The aim of this work was to study, at the atomic scale, the effects of Cr on the segregation behaviors of impurities and the synergetic effects between co-doped atoms on the resistance to dissolution corrosion of Ni (111) surfaces. The results indicate that impurities S, P, O, and H prefer to be trapped at near-surface sites, that Cr was uniformly distributed in the Ni crystal and can affect the segregation behavior of impurities S and P to move toward the surface, and it affects impurities N and O such that they shift from the surface to the subsurface. The formation of near-surface Cr nitrides (speculated to be Cr2N based on the results obtained for particular co-doped surfaces) was also noted. Introducing Cr enhances the structural stability of the Ni (111) surface and protects it from being corroded when impurities are present. The elementary processes studied afforded microscopic insights into the formation of a Cr-depleted zone, a phenomenon that leads to local corrosion of the Ni alloy surface. The results of our theoretical calculations explain some of the experimental results previously observed at the atomic scale.

TI A microstructural observation of near-failure thermal barrier coating: a
   study by photostimulated luminescence spectroscopy and transmission
   electron microscopy
SO THIN SOLID FILMS
AB An intact thermal barrier coating (TBC) specimen consisting of electron-beam physical vapor deposited (EB-PVD) ZrO2-7 wt-%Y2O3 (YSZ) topcoat, thermally grown oxide (TGO), grit-blasted (Ni,Pt)Al bond coat and CMSX-4 single crystalline superalloy, was characterized after 645 thermal cycles. Each thermal cycle was carried out in air, and consisted of 10-min heat-up to 1038 degreesC, 10-h hold at 1038 degreesC, and 10-min forced air-quench to ambient temperature., Characteristics of TGO scale were initially examined by photostimulated luminescence spectroscopy (PSLS) and scanning electron microscopy equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning TEM (STEM) with nano-spot energy dispersive spectroscopy, high-angle annular dark field (HAADF) imaging, selected area diffraction (SAD), convergent beam electron diffraction (CBED), and electron energy loss spectroscopy was carried out for detailed microstructural characterization. A site-specific preparation of TEM specimen for the thermally cycled TBC was successfully carried out using focused ion beam in-situ lift out technique. Photostimulated luminescence corresponding to negligible residual stress in TGO scale was observed for this intact TBC. Microstructural analysis showed undulation of interface between TGO and bond coat, and the corresponding damage near YSZ/TGO interface. Extensive decohesion within TGO (nearly 9 mum thick), near the YSZ/TGO interface, was observed by TEM/STEM, and related to the observation made by PSLS. Microstructure and phase constituents of mixed-oxide zone containing Zr, Y, Ta, Ni, Co, Cr, Ti in Al2O3 matrix and continuous-columnar Al2O3 TGO are presented based on TEM/STEM and related analytical techniques.

TI THE CURRENT SITUATION OF APPLICATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF SUPERALLOYS IN
   THE FIELDS OF ENERGY INDUSTRY
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB Superalloys are extensively applied in the fields of energy industry. In the high parameter ultra-supercritical boiler used for coal-fired generation, superheater/reheater tubes must be made of superalloys which meet the requirement of good creep resistant, good fire-side corrosion resistant and steam-side oxidation resistant properties. In gas turbine engine used for gas power, turbine blades and guide vanes should be made of hot-corrosion resistant superalloys which must meet the requirements with respect to excellent high temperature corrosion resistance and long-term microstructural stability. In the field of nuclear power, heat exchange tubes used for steam generator require superalloys with excellent solution corrosion resistance. In the field of coal gasification and energy conservation and pollution reduction, the superalloys with excellent hot corrosion resistant and high temperature wear resistant properties are widely applied. In petroleum exploitation, especially in deep mining, drilling tools must be made of corrosion resistant and wear resistant superalloys because of the sour environment, the temperature of 4-150 degrees C and the existences of CO(2), H(2)S, sand and so on. This paper makes a brief introduction on the current situation of application and development of the superalloys at home and abroad in these fields.

AB One type of functionally graded coating system is thermal barrier coating (TBC), where the combination of ceramic and metallic coating is used both to reduce the temperature and to increase oxidation and corrosion resistance of the substrate. TBCs usually consist of the top ceramic coating based on YSZ (ZrO2+Y2O3) and the metallic bond coating of M-CrAlY type, where M means Ni, Co or their appropriate combination. Electron beam physical vapour deposition (EB-PVD) or vacuum (VPS), low pressure (LPPS) or atmospheric (APS) plasma spraying techniques are most frequently used as a deposition method. Despite some requirements on the product shape simplicity, the air plasma spraying offers high productivity, sufficient quality and much lower production costs in comparison with the EB-PVD technology. The contribution deals with high temperature structural stability of TBCs of YSZ + NiCrAlY and YSZ + CoNiCrAlY types that were produced by air plasma spraying on the INCONEL 713LC polycrystalline nickel based superalloy substrate. Immediately after deposition, the specimens were exposed to temperature of 1000 C for 5-500 hours in the common ambient atmosphere. The changes in both microstructure and chemical composition were studied by means of scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive microanalysis and image analysis methods.

TI Interaction of coal-derived synthesis gas impurities with solid oxide
   fuel cell metallic components
SO JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES
AB Oxidation-resistant alloys find use as interconnect materials, heat exchangers, and gas supply tubing in solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) systems, especially when operated at temperatures below similar to 800 degrees C. If fueled with synthesis gas derived from coal or biomass, such metallic components could be exposed to impurities contained in those fuel sources. In this study, coupons of ferritic stainless steels Crofer 22 APU and SS 441, austenitic nickel-chromium superalloy Inconel 600, and an alumina-forming high nickel alloy alumel were exposed to synthesis gas containing <= 2 ppm phosphorus, arsenic and antimony, and reaction products were tested. Crofer 22 APU coupons coated with a (Mn,Co)(3)O(4) protective layer were also evaluated. Phosphorus was found to be the most reactive. On Crofer 22 APU, the (Mn,Cr)(3)O(4) passivation layer reacted to form an Mn-P-O product, predicted to be manganese phosphate from thermochemical calculations, and Cr(2)O(3). On SS 441, reaction of phosphorus with (Mn,Cr)(3)O(4) led to the formation of manganese phosphate as well as an Fe-P product, predicted from thermochemical calculations to be Fe(3)P. Minimal interactions with antimony or arsenic in synthesis gas were limited to Fe-Sb and Fe-As solid solution formation. Though not intended for use on the anode side, a (Mn,Co)(3)O(4) spinel coating on Crofer 22 APU reacted with phosphorus in synthesis gas to produce products consistent with Mn(3)(PO(4))(2) and Co(2)P. A thin Cr(2)O(3) passivation layer on Inconel 600 did not prevent the formation of nickel phosphides and arsenides and of iron phosphides and arsenides, though no reaction with Cr(2)O(3) was apparent. On alumel, an Al(2)O(3) passivation layer rich in Ni did not prevent the formation of nickel phosphides, arsenides, and antimonides, though no reaction with Al(2)O(3) occurred. This work shows that unprotected metallic components of an SOFC stack and system can provide a sink for P. As and Sb impurities that may be present in fuel gases, and thus complicate experimental studies of impurity interactions with the anode. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI An analytical approach to the beta-phase coarsening behaviour in a
   thermally sprayed CoNiCrAlY bond coat alloy
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB This paper investigates the beta-phase coarsening behaviour during isothermal heat treatment of freestanding CoNiCrAlY (Co-31.7%Ni-20.8%Cr-8.1%Al-0.5%Y, all in wt%) coatings prepared by high velocity oxy-fuel (HVOF) thermal spraying. The microstructure of the coatings was characterised using scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD). It comprises a two phase structure of fcc gamma-Ni matrix and bcc beta-NiAl precipitates. The volume fraction of the gamma-Ni and the beta-NiAl phases were measured to be around 70% and 30% respectively, with grain sizes varying largely from 0.5 to 2 mu m for both phases. Isothermal heat treatments of the freestanding coatings were carried out at 1100 degrees C for times up to 250 h. The beta-phase coarsening behaviour during isothermal heat treatments was analysed by quantitative metallography. It is shown that the coarsening behaviour of beta phase in the CoNiCrAlY alloy followed the classical Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner (LSW) theory of Ostwald ripening. By incorporating a dimensionless factor Which correlates with volume fraction of the beta phase, a modified LSW model coupled with formulaic interfacial energy and effective diffusion coefficient of the CoNiCrAlY alloy was utilised to interpret the coarsening behaviour of the beta phase. The coarsening rate coefficient obtained from the modified LSW model shows good agreement with the corresponding experimental result. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Strain controlled isothermal low cycle fatigue life, deformation and
   fracture characteristics of Superni 263 superalloy
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB The total axial strain controlled low-cycle fatigue (LCF) behaviour of a wrought nickel-base superalloy Superni 263 has been evaluated at 298 K, 673 K, and 923 K employing the strain amplitudes in the range +/- 0.25% to +/- 0.80%. All the tests were performed using a triangular wave form at a constant strain rate of 10(-3) s(-1). The Superni 263 alloy was subjected to a solutionizing treatment at 1373 K/1.5 h followed by water quenching. An ageing treatment of 1073 K/8 h was given to the solutionized samples. The microstructure of the alloy is composed of gamma' in the intragranular regions and discrete M23C6 precipitates on the grain boundaries. Few undissolved (Ti, Mo)C and TiN precipitates were also noticed in the matrix. The strain amplitude and temperature played a significant role in the evolution of macroscopic cyclic stress response and the development of deformation substructure. The alloy displayed serrated flow in the plastic portions of stress-strain hysteresis loops in the tests conducted at 673 K and 923 K, predominantly at strain amplitudes higher than +/- 0.40%. Several manifestations depicting the occurrence of dynamic strain ageing (DSA) were derived by analysing both the macroscopic and micro-mechanistic information generated. The comparative evaluation of monotonic and cyclic stress-strain curves was conducted and the factors responsible for rapid cyclic hardening during DSA were identified. The fatigue life decreased drastically with increasing temperature, particularly at low strain amplitudes. The strain life data could be represented well by using Basquin and Coffin-Manson relationships. The slope in Coffin-Manson relationship revealed more negative values under the influence of DSA. The crack initiation and propagation modes at all the test conditions remained transgranular without the indications of interference from creep and oxidation effects. The deformation substructure at elevated temperatures was characterized by the occurrence of co-planar slip, stacking faults, micro twinning and high dislocation density in between the slip bands.

TI Material Response at Tool-Chip Interface and Its Effects on Tool Wear in
   Turning Inconel718
SO MATERIALS AND MANUFACTURING PROCESSES
AB Because nickel-based alloy Inconel718 has poor thermal conductivity and serious work hardening, it is identified as a difficult-to-process material. The serious tool wear leads to short tool life. In this study, physical vapor deposition-coated carbide tools were used to machine Inconel718. The material response for different cutting speeds at the tool-chip interface and its effect on tool wear were studied. The results showed that at low cutting speed (v (c)=20m/min), cold welding and adhesion occurred at the tool-chip interface under high stress, and then the built-up edge (BUE) formed. The peeling off of BUE led to chipping. When the cutting speed (v (c)) was 45m/min, diffusion and oxidation occurred at the tool-chip interface. The new generated material reduced tool hardness and bond strength of Co. The wear debris was generated in tool rake face. Flakes of wear debris fell from the tool substrate, which increased tool wear. When the cutting speed was 32m/min, the softer oxides generated at the tool-chip interface served as a boundary lubrication layer. They can effectively weaken the adhesion between tool and chip, which made the chemical wear and adhesive wear reach equilibrium. Furthermore, the friction coefficient is reduced. Tool wear is reduced under this cutting condition.

TI Change in microstructure of plasma sprayed thermal barrier coating by
   high temperature isothermal heat exposure
SO JOURNAL OF THE JAPAN INSTITUTE OF METALS
AB The change of microstructure in an atmospheric plasma sprayed thermal barrier coating (APS-TBC) by isothermal heat exposure has been studied. Used 8 mass% Y2O2-ZrO2 TBC layer, a Ni-Co-Cr-Al-Y bond coat (BC) layer, and an IN738 superalloy substrate. The TBC system is subjected to heat exposure at 1423 K in ambient air for 10, 50, 100, 200, 300, and 400 h. Polished transverse sections of heat-exposed TBCs are examined and the changes of constitutes are discussed. Both sintering and cracking of the TBC layer are observed and these behaviors are strongly correlated with the morphology of as-sprayed intersplat boundaries and heat exposure time, respectively. A thermally grown oxide (TGO) layer is formed after heat exposure, and the thickness increases with the increase in heat exposure time. The chemical composition and morphology of the TGO layer depend on the heat exposure time. Micro-cracking in the TGO layer and TBC layer is observed after formation of a spinel, which is attributed to a lack of Al in the BC layer. The composition and phases in the BC layer are strongly correlated with the growth behavior of the TGO layer.

TI Preparation and Enhanced Hot Corrosion Resistance of a Zr-Doped
   PtAl2+(Ni, Pt)Al Dual-Phase Coating
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB Prior to practical service, hot-section components (e.g. airfoils and vanes) of a gas turbine engine are necessarily coated by a protective metallic coating (such as aluminidi diffusion coating, modified aluminide coating and MCrAlY overlay etc.) to resist high temperature oxidation and hot corrosion. Among the modified aluminide coatings, the coating with Pt-modification has attracted great attention and is widely used in applications requiring high reliability and extended service life since it possesses superior oxidation/corrosion resistance at high temperature. The presence of Pt in aluminide coating is favorable for increasing bonding strength of oxide scale, enlarging phase region of beta 3-NiAI and confining detrimental effect of sulphur etc. Although Pt-modification has exhibited visible benefits for acquiring better high-temperature performance, it is far from satisfaction to develop an ideal aluminide diffusion coating. Reactive elements such as Y, Hf, Zr or their oxides have been employed to modify the nickel aluminide coating system, with an aim to further improve scale adhesion and promote exclusive formation of alpha-Al2O3 simultaneously. In this work, a Zr-doped PtAl2+(Ni, Pt)Al dual-phase aluminide coating was prepared on a Ni-based single crystal superalloy by co-deposition of Pt-Zr through electroplating and sub-sequent aluminization treatments The coating was mainly composed of three layers: the outmost layer consisted of double phases with PtAl2 particles dispersed in beta-(Ni, Pt)Al domain, while the interlayer comprised beta-(Ni, Pt)Al with small amount of Cr-precipitates, and the bottom layer was an inter-diffusion zone (IDZ). Zirconium was mainly distributed inside beta-(Ni, Pt)Al solid solution in both the outmost layer and the interlayer. Compared with normal PtAl2+(Ni, Pt)Al dual-phase coating, the hot corrosion behavior of the Zr-doped PtAl2 + (Ni, Pt)Al coating was assessed in a salt mixture of Na2SO4/NaCI (75:25, mass ratio) at 850 degrees C in static air. The results indicated that the Zr-doped PtAl2+(Ni, Pt)Al dual-phase coating exhibited superior hot corrosion resistance since Zr was confirmed able to capture and fix S and CI to diminish their detrimental effects. Meanwhile, a pre-oxidation treatment did not effectively improve the overall hot corrosion resistance of normal PtAl2+(Ni, Pt)Al coating because the thin alumina scale formed during pre-oxidation was unable to prohibit the sustained inward-invasion of the mixed salt.

TI Studies of the metallurgical and mechanical properties of high velocity
   oxy-fuel sprayed stellite-6 coatings on Ni- and Fe-based superalloys
SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB High-velocity oxygen-fuel (HVOF) process is one of the most popular thermal spraying technologies and has been widely adopted by many industries due to its flexibility and the superior quality of coatings produced. This paper demonstrates the successful application of Stellite-6 metallic coatings on the Ni- and Fe-based superalloys by HVOF process for hot corrosion applications. The microstructure, porosity, coating thickness, phase formation and microhardness properties of the coatings were characterised using the combined techniques of optical microscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive analysis (SEM/EDAX) and electron probe microanalysis (EPMA). The coatings exhibited characteristic splatlike, layered morphologies due to the deposition and re-solidification of successive molten or semi-molten powder particles. The coating possesses porosity, unmelted and semimelted particles, and inclusions. The coatings have porosity less than 2% and hardness values in the range of 800-900 Hv. The as sprayed microstructure has a face centred cubic (fec) Co-rich metallic matrix with very small fraction of CoNiO2 spinet oxide. EDAX analysis of the coating microstructure confirmed that the coating composition is similar to the feedstock powder. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Life-time determining spalling mechanisms of NiCoCrAlRE/EB-PVD zirconia
   TBC systems
SO MATERIALWISSENSCHAFT UND WERKSTOFFTECHNIK
AB The mechanisms that control the lifetime of thermal barrier coating (TBC) systems have been traced by two particular overlay bondcoats serving as model systems: superalloy pins (IN100, CMSX-4) with two alternative NiCoCrAlRE (RE: Hf, Y) bond coat compositions (i) NiCoCrAlY without and (ii) with co-dopants of silicon and hafnium. On top an electron-beam physical-vapor deposited (EB-PVD) yttria partially stabilized zirconia (YPSZ) TBC commonly mixed with 2 wt.% hafnia, or, rarely with 10 wt.%, was applied. The test pins were thermo-cycled at 1100 and 1150 degrees C until failure. Identical lifetimes in cyclic tests on YPSZ TBCs with 2 (relatively high sintering rate) and 10 wt.% hafnia (relatively low sintering rate) preclude an effect of diffusion mechanisms of the YPSZ TBC on lifetime. The fit of lifetimes and test temperatures to Arrhenius-type relationships gives activation energies for failure. These energies agree with the activation energies for anion and cation diffusion in alumina for the respective bondcoat variant:
   (i) for the NiCoCrAlY/TBC system for O-2- diffusion in alumina,
   (ii) for the NiCoCrAlYSiHf/TBC system for Al3+ diffusion in alumina. SEM and EDS investigations of the thermally grown oxides (TGOs) confirm the mechanisms responsible for TBC failure.as indicated by activation energies. Two categories of failure can be distinguished: (i) NiCoCrAlY coatings fail by an "adhesive mode of failure" along smooth bond coat/TGO interfaces driven by a critical TGO thickness. (ii) NiCoCrAlYSiHf coatings fail later and more reluctantly by a "cohesive" crack mode via de-cohesion at the TGO/TBC interface. In the latter case a quasi-integrity of the crack-affected TGO is lengthily maintained U to failure by a crack-pinning mechanism which runs via Al(3+)psupply from the bondcoat.

AB The effect of V on hot corrosion behavior of cast Ni-base superalloy K417G exposed to 75%Na2SO4 +25%NaCl at 900 degrees C for 100 h has been investigated by thermogravimetry (TG) and scanning electron microscopy equipped with energy dispersive X-ray spectrum (EDS), and corrosion resistance was obtained by measuring the polarization curve at 900 degrees C. The results show that the hot corrosion rate of the alloy with 0.016% V content is almost unchanged, the hot corrosion rate of alloy increases with the increase of V content, but the hot corrosion rate of alloy with 1.19% V content is 100 times more than that of the low V alloy. The corrosion product on the surface of K417G alloys is found to be composed of oxides and sulfides. The oxides consist of Al, Cr, Co, Ti and Ni, while the sulfides include NiS, MoS and NiCrS. With the content of V content increasing, S element diffuses toward to interlayer, and the layer of Al2O3 and Cr2O3 becomes thinner; hence the inner sulfides layer formed in the alloy with 1.19% V decreases the corrosion resistance. Compared with the alloy with 1.19% V, the corrosion potential of the alloy with 0.016% V shifts 0.4 V toward positive direction, and the corrosion resistance is better than that alloy with high V content.

AB As-fabricated thermal barrier coating (TBC) systems generally consist of a superalloy substrate, a MCrAlY bond coat (M=Ni, Co, Fe), and a ceramic (usually partially stabilized zirconia) top coat. The conventional methods for producing the two coating layers generally derive from thermal spray and physical vapor deposition techniques. Thermal exposure leads to the formation of an additional layer: the thermally grown oxide (TGO) between the bond coat and top coat. In the present work, a TBC system is synthesized through the application of spark plasma sintering (SPS), which provides not only the opportunity to synthesize all three layers at once, but the process is quite rapid and can produce dense layers. More specifically, this paper describes the application of this method to an yttria-stabilized ZrO2 (YSZ) top coat and a NiCrAlY bond coat on a Ni-base Hastelloy X substrate. A one-micron thick Al2O3 TGO layer is also created from the reaction between an Al foil layer inserted in the stack prior to sintering and the ZrO2 in the top coat. The effects of select process conditions are considered. The resulting multi-layer system is characterized with optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Differential thermal analysis (DTA) is used to investigate the reaction between the Al foil and the YSZ top coat. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The 60 Hz, Frame 7F engine has been in commercial operation for more than two decades now with approximately 800 Frame 7 (F, FA, FA+ and FA+e models) machines existing in North America and a total of over 1100 F-class machines throughout the world. Of importance to operators/users and owners of this gas turbine engine is the ability to not only recondition the turbine "hot-end section" components, in order to support maintenance requirements, but also to reduce the life cycle costs of these components.
   Stage 1 nozzles are a cast doublet, manufactured from FSX-414 Co-based superalloy. There are 24 nozzles in an engine set. As a result of the extreme turbine inlet temperatures at the 1st stage nozzle, these components experience severe thermal fatigue cracking. On one particular OEM engine set inspected, over 600 cracks were identified on each nozzle after engine operation. As a consequence, the stage 1 nozzles when compared to the other components in the engine exhibits the worst degradation and is therefore a focus point of reconditioning for those in the industry.
   The technical objective is to describe the development of a repair scheme for the stage 1 nozzle that can successfully address and repair this level of severe cracking and oxidation, with 0% scrap/fallout for a heavy repair, after a normal duty cycle. Special processes have been established for these components repairs, including but not limited to removal of the damaged and oxidized trailing edges by machining, high frequency Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW) of new trailing edge coupons.
   This technical paper describes the repair process development and implementation of the different stages of the repair schemes and shows metallurgical and mechanical characteristics of the repaired regions of the component. As a result of successfully executing these special processes, although a heavy repair workscope was implemented; all the nozzles were successfully repaired without any scrap.
