TI Type II Hot Corrosion Screening Tests of a Cr2AlC MAX Phase Compound
SO OXIDATION OF METALS
AB Low-temperature hot corrosion tests were performed on bulk Cr2AlC MAX phase compounds for the first time. This material is a known alumina-former with good oxidation and Type I high-temperature hot corrosion resistance. Unlike traditional (Ni,Co)CrAl alumina formers, it contains no Ni or Co that may react with Na2SO4 salt deposits needed to form corrosive mixed (Ni,Co)SO4-Na2SO4 eutectic salts active in Type II hot corrosion. Cr2AlC samples coated with 20K(2)SO(4)-80Na(2)SO(4) salt were exposed to 300ppm SO2 at 700 degrees C for times up to 500h. Weight change, recession, and cross-sectional microstructures identified some reactivity, but much reduced (<1/10) compared to a Ni(Co) superalloy baseline material. Layered Al2O3/Cr2O3 scales were indicated, either separated by or intermixed with some retained salt. However, there was no conclusive indication of salt melting. Accelerated oxidation was proposed to explain the results, and coarse Cr7C3 impurities appeared to play a negative role. In contrast, the superalloy exhibited outer Ni(Co) oxide and inner Cr2O3 scales, with Cr-S layers at the interfaces. Massive spallation of the corrosion layers occurred repeatedly for the superalloy, but not at all for Cr2AlC. This indicates some potential for Cr2AlC as LTHC-resistant coatings for superalloys.

AB A study of transient liquid-phase bonding (TLPB) of dissimilar materials consisting of a nickel-based superalloy and a cobalt material is performed. In contrast to the assumption that rapid atomic diffusion in the liquid would reduce the processing time, t (f), required to completely eliminate the liquid phase from the joint region through diffusional solidification, the occurrence of liquid-state diffusion significantly prolonged the processing time t (f). This finding is crucially important to the TLPB of dissimilar materials.

AB An enterprise for purification of crude ammonium perrhenate purchased at Central Asia region as well as for rhenium recovery from Re-Ni heat resistant superalloys wastes of CMSX-4 & CMSX-10 types, has started its activity at Czech Republic. First type of rhenium raw material - the initial ammonium perrhenate (APR), for example, according to Uzbekistan's Standard TU 48-7-1-90, type AR-0, contains: Re not less than 69 % mass.; impurities, ppm: P 90, S 200, Fe 50, Si 20, Mn 2; Mg 8, Ni 2, Al 5, Mo 5, Ca 10, Cu 3, K 40-70; Na 40. By means of ion exchange on Purolite resins surface and electrodialysis approach the content of above mentioned impurities in NH4ReO4 salt might be significantly reduced (K < 20). Second type of rhenium raw material - metallic wastes of superalloys of CMSX-4 & CMSX-10 type contains, % mass: Re 3-6; Cr 6.5; Co 9; Mo 0.6; W 6; Ta 6.5; Re 3; Al 5.6; Ti 1; Hf 0.1; Ni 61.7. The resulting APR is of high quality too. Powdery metal rhenium might be produced from this APR by means of its high-temperature reduction by gaseous hydrogen. The purity of obtained metallic rhenium is generally determined by purity of APR applied.

TI Solidification Reaction Sequence of Co-Rich Nb-Al-Co Alloys

   MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB The freezing reaction sequence of Co-rich Nb-Al-Co ternary alloys with emphasis on the formation of Laves and Heusler phases has been examined. For Co-rich alloys, the solidification reaction sequence is observed as primary freezing of alpha-Co and CoAl phases, subsequent [Co + C36] and [CoAl + C36] eutectics, and the final ternary eutectic reaction [L -> alpha-Co + C36 + CoAl]. The compositions of solidified alpha-Co and C36 phases agree with the corresponding vertices of the tie-triangle at the solidus temperatures. When the Nb concentration is over 20 at. pct in Co-rich alloys, the quasi-peritectic reaction [L + Co2AlNb -> C36 + CoAl] does not occur as equilibrium prediction. The formation of C36 and CoAl phases occurs through solid precipitation and must be distinguished from a solidification reaction.

Nickel and cobalt base superalloys and iron base stainless steels were tested in different combinations, and their wear rates compared to determine optimal wear resistance. The results show that an alloy's wear resistance is highly dependent on operating temperature and its coupling with another material. The influences of friction, hardness, and oxide formation on the alloy's wear resistance are also presented and discussed.

TI Sulphidation Behavior of a Non Harmful Water-Based Al and Al-Si Slurry
   Coating on CM247 Superalloy
SO OXIDATION OF METALS
AB Slurry aluminide coatings are widely applied to protect metallic surfaces from oxidation and corrosion. They are frequently used in gas turbine engine nozzles because of economical advantages and a straight-forward manufacturing route. A variety of commercial slurries are available to aluminize the surfaces of nickel-based superalloys, however, they have two main disadvantages. First, the phosphates and chromates or halides used as binders and to activate the diffusion species are environmentally harmful; second, the conventional systems have to be heat-treated in an inert atmosphere. As an outcome of the PARTICOAT project the variety of slurry derived coatings has been extended by tailoring the particle size of the metallic source. By doing that, environmentally friendly water-based slurries were developed to produce in a one-step process und atmospheric conditions, a thermal barrier system based on an aluminum diffusion layer and an alumina foam layer which serves as bond coat as well as top coat (TC). CM 247 nickel base superalloy was coated and heat-treated in air using newly developed Al and Al-Si slurries. The oxidation behavior was investigated at 1,000 A degrees C and then compared to pack-cemented aluminide coatings. The sulphidation behavior was investigated at 1,000 A degrees C in an atmosphere of 1.5 vol% SO2 in synthetic air for Al and Al-Si slurry coated samples with and without the alumina foam TC layer. PARTICOAT Al-based slurries,, after the initial stabilization of the TC, showed similar oxidation kinetics as pack cemented aluminides when exposed to air. When the coatings were exposed to sulphide-containing atmospheres, their oxidation rates increased, producing typical type I corrosion damage. Coatings without TC produced more protective oxide scales. The weight gain and coating area affected by corrosion were slightly lower for the Al-based slurries after 1,000 h of exposure than for the Al-Si based ones. The new coating presented here offers unique advantages in comparison to state-of-the-art slurry and pack cemented coatings by opening a potential way to manufacture a complete thermal barrier coating system by a simple, inexpensive and environmentally safe deposition and heat-treatment in air.

TI Effects of MC Carbide Precipitates on the Microstructure and Mechanical
   Properties of Cobalt-Based Alloys Adding TiC Powder via Vacuum Sintering
   Process
SO MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS
AB In this study, different amounts of fine TiC powders (0, 10, 15 and 20 mass%) were mixed and added to cobalt-based alloy powders. Then, the mixed composite materials (cobalt-based alloy and TiC powders) were vacuum sintered at 1260, 1270, 1280 and 1290 degrees C for 1 h, respectively. The experimental results showed that the highest TRS value of 1485.1MPa was obtained by the addition of 15 mass% TiC powder and sintering at 1280 degrees C for 1 h; while the highest hardness value of HRA 80.4 was obtained by 20 mass% TiC powder sintered at 1290 degrees C for 1 h. In addition, two types of carbide precipitates appeared in the microstructure. Without added TiC powder of the specimen, fine plate-like precipitates of M6C and M23C6 carbides were obvious on the grain boundary; but when TiC powder was added to the specimens, only M23C6 carbides were observed after sintering treatment. The result also showed that a suitable amount of TiC additive (15 mass%) effectively inhibits carbide precipitation and growth.

   for wear-resistant applications
SO MATERIALS & DESIGN
AB Cobalt-based superalloys, Stellite 694 and Stellite 712, composites were developed with the reinforcement of titanium-carbide particles for wear-resistant applications. The specimens were fabricated using the powder metallurgy technique, combined with hot isostatic pressing. Calorimetric effects of the alloy powders were investigated using the differential scanning calorimetry technique, which provided the theoretical basis of designing the sintering cycles. The phases formed in the microstructures were analyzed using the scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectrum (EDS) techniques. The wear test was conducted on a ball-on-disc tribometer. It was demonstrated that the wear resistance of the alloys had been increased significantly by the titanium-carbide reinforcement and the hot isostatic pressing process had enhanced the wear resistance of the materials.

TI ELASTIC ENERGY CHANGES ACCOMPANYING GAMMA-PRIME RAFTING IN NICKEL-BASE
   SUPERALLOYS
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS RESEARCH
AB Eshelby's equivalent inclusion method is applied to the case of a single, inhomogeneous, ellipsoidal precipitate in an infinite matrix to study the morphological changes of the gamma-prime precipitates in nickel-base superalloys due to the influence of lattice constant misfit, elastic inhomogeneity and anisotropy, applied stress, and interfacial energy.  The energy-minimizing inclusion shapes depend very sensitively on the degree of elastic inhomogeneity, on the sense and magnitude of the applied stress, and on the sense of the lattice constant misfit.  The interfacial energy contribution can dominate that of elastic strain energy for small precipitate sizes, elastically compliant systems, nearly homogeneous alloys, and/or nearly isotropic materials.  Calculations are carried out for two well-characterized nickel-base alloys:  a Ni-13.5Al alloy (positive misfit, elastically hard inclusions) studied by Miyazaki et al. and CMSX-3 (negative misfit, elastically soft inclusions) studied by Pollock.  The Eshelby energy calculations correctly predict the precipitate morphologies observed by Miyazaki et al. and by Pollock.

SO ARCHIVES OF METALLURGY AND MATERIALS
AB Cobalt based heat - resisting superalloys are widely used for turbine blades and stationary elements of gas turbines (combustion space and stator blades) in acro-engines. These elements are generally produced by the investment casting method. The use of cobalt aluminate (CoAl2O4) for reducing relative;rain size of precision investment castings results in higher mechanical properties. The aim of the present work was settlement of basic physical and chemical properties of cobalt aluminate powder and its concentration in the interior surface of invested mould on the grain size and the microstructure, and in consequence, mechanical properties of high temperature creep resisting superalloy MAR M 509. For this purpose. file ceramic moulds were made with different kinds oh cobalt aluminate (manufactured by two different companies: Mason Color and Permedia Lublin) and its concentration in the primary slurry was from 0 to 10% mass. in zirconium flour. Stepped and cylindrical samples were casted for microstructure and mechanical examinations. The average grain size of the matrix (gamma phase). was determined on the stepped samples. The influence of surface modification on the grain size of tip to section thickness was considered. The microstructure investigations with the use of light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) enable to examine the influence of the surface modification on the morphology of carbides precipitations. Verification of the influence of CoAl2O4 on the mechanical properties of castings were investigated on the basis of results obtained form tensile and creep tests.

SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB The solidification behaviour of four nickel-base superalloys has been studied using the technique of quenched directional solidification.  Three of the alloys are designed for use as single crystals whereas the fourth, MAR-M002, is used in directionally solidified form.  Freezing begins in all alloys with the formation of gamma-Ni dendrites and is terminated by a gamma + gamma' eutectic reaction.  In MAR-M002, MC-type carbides form, with a Chinese-script morphology, in the interdendritic liquid behind the dendrite tips.  Phase transformation temperatures were measured, together with the evolution of fraction solid with temperature.  The behaviour of MAR-M002 is significantly more complex than that of the single-crystal alloys.  Primary and secondary dendrite arm spacings correlate with solidification parameters and are relatively insensitive to alloy constitution.  Measurements of elemental partitioning at the start of freezing show that aluminium, hafnium, molybdenum, tantalum and titanium always segregate to the liquid, cobalt and vanadium segregate to the dendrite core, and the segregation direction of chromium and tungsten depends on alloy constitution.

TI The role of superalloy precipitates on the early stages of oxidation and

SO MATERIALS AT HIGH TEMPERATURES
AB To meet materials challenges encountered in gas turbines, superalloys have been developed for high temperature, strength, oxidation and corrosion resistance. One strengthening method is using refractory metal additions to form carbide precipitates. However, such precipitates may be detrimental to the alloy's environmental resistance. This paper reports how refractory metal carbide precipitates affect the early stages of oxidation and hot corrosion of two alloys: Rene 80 (nickel-based) and MarM 509 (cobalt-based). Samples were exposed at 700 degrees C in either dry synthetic air or 90 ppm SOx , 10.5% CO2 , 8.5% O-2 5% H2O (balance N) with a 80/20 (Na/ K)(2) SO4 deposit (1.5 mu g/cm(2)/hour flux). The oxidation morphology and corrosion products were investigated by scanning electron microscope and energy dispersive X-ray analysis, to show that refractory metal carbide precipitates close to the metal surfaces disrupt protective oxide scale formation, thus providing inward transport routes for corrosive species.

AB In the present study, a Co1.5CrFeNi1.5Ti0.5 high-entropy alloy has been investigated for its high-temperature microstructural stability. This material is shown to possess mainly a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure; the eta phase is present at the interdendritic region in the as-cast condition, and it is stable between 1073 K and 1273 K (800 degrees C and 1000 degrees C); gamma' particles are found throughout the microstructures below 1073 K (800 degrees C). Segregation analysis has been conducted on a single crystal sample fabricated by a directional solidification process with a single crystal seed. Results show that Co, Cr, and Fe partition toward the dendritic region, while Ni and Ti partition toward the interdendritic areas. Scheil analysis indicates that the solid-liquid partitioning ratio of each element is very similar to those in typical single crystal superalloys.

AB The thermal barrier coatings (TBC) enable to lower temperature (at approx. 170 degrees C) of operating elements in a hot section of gas turbine to a range, which enables to operate for a long time in conditions of high temperature influence and prolongs operation of them even three or four times. Usually, the TBC coverings are constructed of four layers:
   superalloys on a base of nickel;
   outer ceramic zone, from which low thermal conduction is required It is, in most cases, ZrO(2) oxide stabilized with Y(2)O(3) (YSZ yttria stabilized zirconia), material of one of lowest values of thermal conductivity in high temperature of a rank 2.3 Wm(-1)K(-1) in 1000 degrees C for 100% density and thermal expansion of a rank 11x10(-6)degrees C-1, what enables to reduce thermal stresses. Usually, thickness of an outer ceramic layer is within a range 250-375 mu m;
   bond coat of a type Ni(Co)CrAlY or diffusion layer of a type (Ni,Pt)Al;
   layer of barrier oxides, accrueting as a result of temperature growth TGO (thermally grown oxide).
   In the present study characterization of conventional micro-sized YSZ powders stabilized by 8% of yttria and in comparison nano-sized YSZ will be presented. The tests performed showed that the monoclinic phase content in the nanocrystalline powder is approx. 8.8%, and approx 7.5% in the conventional powder. The chemical composition analysis and test of powder microstructure were also performed Carbon, sulphur and gas nitrogen contents were determined and the results received were similar The surface morphology and powder microstructure on the cross-sections were also characterized. The standard powder with spherical shape and relatively smooth surface is predominant. The internal structure is characterized by the presence of tiny sintered particles and low porosity. The nanocrystalline powder tests showed the presence of particles in the form of tiny polyhedrons with bimodal size distribution of particles (approx. 1 mu m and 10 mu m).

Chip morphology, cutting forces and tool wear were compared by using PVD coated and uncoated hard metal inserts which are obtained dependent on feed rate, cutting speed and cutting depth. The cutting forces increase as the feed rate and depth of the cut increases, but cutting speeds' effect on cutting forces has not been observed for symmetric face milling. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Study on 3d-Shell Electrons and Bond Configuration in Ni-Co-Cr
   Superalloys by Positron Annihilation Spectroscopy
SO RARE METAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING
AB Doppler-broadening spectra of positron annihilation radiation for pure metals Ni, Co and Cr and Ni-Co-Cr alloys with three different chemical compositions were measured by 2-detector coincidence technique. And the effect of the 3d electrons on Ni-Co-Cr alloy formation was analyzed. The results show that the 3d electron signal for the metal Ni is relatively higher among the three pure metals. The increase of Ni atom proportion in Ni-Co-Cr alloys leads to an increase in the probability of positron annihilation with free electrons. The experimental ratio curves for three Ni-Co-Cr alloys are greatly similar to the corresponding theoretic ratio curves, which indicate that the bonding nature in Ni-Co-Cr alloys is mainly metallic. This can explain why the Ni-Co-Cr alloys have good metal ductility.

TI Friction and Wear Characteristics of Haynes 25, 188, and 214 Superalloys
   Against Hastelloy X up to 540 A degrees C
SO TRIBOLOGY LETTERS
AB As demand for more power increases, compression ratios, and operating temperatures keep rising. High speeds combined with high temperatures make turbomachinery sealing applications even more challenging. In order to confirm sufficient service life material pairs should be tested under conditions similar to engine operating conditions. This study presents high temperature friction and wear characteristics of cobalt/nickel superalloys, Haynes 25 (51Co-10Ni-20Cr-15W), Haynes 188 (39Co-22Ni-22Cr-14W), and Haynes 214 (75Ni-16Cr-3Fe-0.5Mn) sheets when rubbed against Hastelloy X (47Ni-22Cr-18Fe-9Mo) pins. Tests are conducted at 25, 200, 400, and 540 A degrees C with a validated custom design linear reciprocating tribometer. Sliding speed and sliding distance are 1 Hz and 1.2 km, respectively. Friction coefficients are calculated with friction force data acquired from a load cell. Wear coefficients are calculated through weight loss measurements. Results indicate that Haynes 25 (H25) has the lowest friction coefficients at all test temperatures. Above 400 A degrees C, H25 and Haynes 188 (H188) exhibit the best wear resistance. Protective cobalt oxide layers are formed on the H25 and H188 at 540 A degrees C in addition to nickel, chrome, and tungsten oxides. Although, it has better oxidation resistance, Haynes 214 has relatively higher wear rates than other tested materials especially at low temperatures. However, its wear performance improves beyond 200 A degrees C.

AB A Co-Ti-W thin film materials library was fabricated by magnetron sputtering. By using automated high-throughput measurement techniques (resistance mapping, automated XRD measurements) and cluster analysis a yet unknown phase region was revealed. The existence region of the new ternary phase is close to the composition Co60Ti15W25. In order to transfer the results from thin film to bulk material, a bulk sample was prepared by arc melting and subsequent heat treatment. Scanning electron microscopy and chemical micro-analysis data support that a yet unknown ternary phase exists in the system Co-Ti-W.

TI Investigation of delamination mechanisms during a laser drilling on a
   cobalt-base superalloy
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY
AB Temperatures in the high pressure chamber of aircraft engines are continuously increasing to improve the engine efficiency. As a result, constitutive materials such as cobalt and nickel-base superalloys need to be thermally protected. The first protection is a ceramic thermal barrier coating (TBC) cast on all the hot gas-exposed structure. The second protection is provided by a cool air layer realized by the use of a thousand of drills on the parts where a cool air is flowing through. The laser drilling process is used to realize these holes at acute angles. It has been shown on coated single crystal nickel-base superalloy that the laser drilling process causes an interfacial cracking (also called delamination), detected by a cross section observation. The present work aims at characterizing interfacial cracking induced by laser drilling on coated cobalt-base super alloy. On the one hand, this work attempted to quantify the crack by several microscopic observations with regards to the most significant process parameters related as the angle beam. On the other hand, we studied the difference of the laser/ceramic and the laser/substrate interaction with real time observation by using a fast movie camera. (c) 2013 The Authors.

TI On the surface preparation of nickel superalloys before CoNiCrAlY
   deposition by thermal spray
SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB This work is dedicated to the study and the characterization of the surface of nickel superalloys before the deposition of the MCrAlY (M = Co, Ni or both) bond coat. Our aim is to determine the factors (roughness, contamination and others) that lead to the best properties of the coating in terms of adhesion. We used MAR M247 samples as substrates. Different preparation treatments were considered: dry and wet blasting by corundum with different grain size distribution, dry blasting by silicon carbide and cleaning by solid carbon dioxide. In general, we observed that the highest roughness led to the best adhesion as measured by critical load tests. However, this parameter must be balanced against known problems related to the use of coarse abrasive powders. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

CL San Antonio, TX
AB The unirradiated tensile properties for several different heats and thermomechanical treatment conditions of precipitation strengthened Hycon 3HPTM CuNiBe (Cu-2%Ni-0.35%Be in wt.%) have been measured over the temperature range of 20-500 C for longitudinal and long transverse orientations. The room temperature electrical conductivity has also been measured for several heats, and the precipitate microstructure was characterized using transmission electron microscopy. The CuNiBe alloys exhibit very good combination of strength and conductivity at room temperature, with yield strengths of 630-725 MPa and electrical conductivities of 65-72% International Annealed Copper Standard (IACS). The strength remained relatively high at all test temperatures, with yield strengths of 420-520 MPa at 500 degrees C. However, low levels of ductility (<5% uniform elongation) were observed at test temperatures above 200-250 C, due to flow localization near grain boundaries (exacerbated by having only 10-20 grains across the gage thickness of the miniaturized sheet tensile specimens). Scanning electron microscopy observation of the fracture surfaces found a transition from ductile transgranular to ductile intergranular fracture with increasing test temperature. Fission neutron irradiation to a dose of 0.7 displacements per atom (dpa) at temperatures between 100 and 240 degrees C produced a slight increase in strength and a significant decrease in ductility. The measured tensile elongation after irradiation increased with increasing irradiation temperature, with a uniform elongation of 3.3% observed at 240 degrees C. The electrical conductivity decreased slightly following irradiation, due to the presence of defect clusters and Ni, Zn, Co transmutation products. Considering also previously published fracture toughness data, this indicates that CuNiBe alloys have irradiated tensile and electrical properties comparable or superior to CuCrZr and oxide dispersion strengthened copper at temperatures <250 degrees C, and may be an attractive candidate for certain lowtemperature fusion energy structural applications. Conversely, CuNiBe may not be preferred at intermediate temperatures of 250-500 degrees C due to the poor ductility and fracture toughness of CuNiBe alloys at temperatures >250 degrees C. The potential deformation mechanisms responsible for the transition from transgranular to intergranular fracture are discussed. The possible implications for other precipitation-hardened alloys such as nickel based superalloys are briefly discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Isothermal Oxidation Behavior of Single-Crystal Nickel-Base Superalloy
   DD10
SO RARE METAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING
AB The isothermal oxidation behaviors of two kinds of single-crystal nickel-base superalloys DD10 with different cobalt contents were investigated at 900, 1000 and 1100 degrees C in air by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy disperse X-ray analysis (EDX). It is found that increasing the cobalt content can decrease the diffusion activity energy of the alloy and thus increase the oxidation rate slightly. For the oxidation at 900 degrees C and 1000 degrees C, the mass gain basically obeys the parabola law. The oxide scales consist of three layers: an outer layer of Cr2O3 and TiO2, a thin intermediate layer of CrTaO4 and Ta2O5, and a continuous inner layer of Al2O3. For the oxidation at 1100 degrees C, because of the severe spalling of the scale and the volatilization of the CrO3, the kinetics curves deviate from the parabolic law a little. Some spinels such as NiCr2O4, CoAl2O4, CoNiO2 and Co2TiO4 form and inner nitridation phenomenon happens.

TI Phase transformations and gamma ' phase stability in model CoAlW
   superalloys
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB The present work aims at understanding the transformation mechanisms of gamma'-L1(2) precipitates in the ternary Co-Al-W system from quenched state to thermodynamic equilibrium. Three alloys with compositions Co-9Al-7W, Co-10Al-12W and Co-7Al-9W (at.%) were aged at 900 degrees C for 10 h, 200 h and 1000 h. The microstructure has been characterized by transmission and scanning electron microscopies, and the phase composition was determined using atom probe tomography. Results show that irrespective of the initial supersaturation, the quenched state is already decomposed into gamma+gamma'. This indicates that even in the Co-7Al-9W alloy that lies in the gamma+Co3W domain of the phase diagram, gamma' phase forms at first, indicating that gamma' is a metastable phase. In the two other alloys, during ageing at 900 degrees C gamma' phase dissolves and the equilibrium state is composed of gamma, CoAl and Co-3 W phases. The gamma' phase in the Co-7Al-9W alloy dissolves more rapidly compared to the two other alloys that are in the gamma+gamma' metastable domain. The volume fraction of Co3W phase increases rapidly with ageing time in the Co-7Al-9W alloy. Whereas gamma' phase is predominant at short ageing times, it becomes a minor phase after 1000 h of ageing, and is replaced mostly by the Co3W phase. As already observed, the transformation from gamma'-L1(2) to Co3W-D0(19) phase is taking place through a stacking fault. This mechanism occurs in the three alloys. In addition, a new dissolution mechanism interpreted as destabilization of the gamma' phase is evidenced in the Co-9Al-7W. The gamma' precipitates tend to split along {111} planes. Transmission electron microscopy investigations show that the dissolution and splitting mechanism of the gamma' phase is initiated by stacking faults, that are subsequently wetted by the gamma phase.

The results indicate that there are three three-phase regions found in the Co-Nb-Ni ternary system at 1373 K: (Ni,Co) + NbCO3 + Ni3Nb, NbCO3 + NbCO2 + Ni3Nb, and NbCO2 + mu + Ni3Nb; and four three-phase regions found in the Ni-Mo-Re ternary system at 1473 K: Re + Ni + chi, Ni +NiMo + sigma, sigma + chi + Ni, and sigma + Mo + NiMo. No ternary compound is observed in the two isothermal sections. The isothermal sections are contrasted with the previous study.

TI Microstructural Changes during High Temperature Service of a
   Cobalt-Based Superalloy First Stage Nozzle
SO ADVANCES IN MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
AB Superalloys are a group of alloys based on nickel, iron, or cobalt, which are used to operate at high temperatures (T > 540 degrees C) and in situations involving very high stresses like in gas turbines, particularly in the manufacture of blades, nozzles, combustors, and discs. Besides keeping its high resistance to temperatures which may approach 85% of their melting temperature, these materials have excellent corrosion resistance and oxidation. However, after long service, these components undergo mechanical and microstructural degradation; the latter is considered a major cause for replacement of the main components of gas turbines. After certain operating time, these components are very expensive to replace, so the microstructural analysis is an important tool to determine the mode of microstructure degradation, residual lifetime estimation, and operating temperature and most important to determine the method of rehabilitation for extending its life. Microstructural analysis can avoid catastrophic failures and optimize the operating mode of the turbine. A case study is presented in this paper.

The cyclic oxidation and interdiffusion behaviour of the coatings at 1200 degrees C were investigated. As compared to the single-doped coating, the co-doped coating revealed suppressed interdiffusion and delayed beta-gamma' phase transformation. Simultaneously, the interfacial voids formation and scale rumpling were inhibited. As a result, the thermally grown oxide (TGO) grown on the co-doped coating exhibited improved adherence and the roles of Pt and Hf in low-Pt/Hf co-doped coating were discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A so called multiphase separation method (MPSM) is proposed to quantitatively separate precipitated phases from their surrounding matrix phase in chemistry for bulk alloy/steel samples under EPMA/SEM-EDS measurement conditions. Applied examples to comparisons of the results through the MPSM with the values either cited or obtained via other analytical means relevant are indicative of the feasibility, accuracy as well as applicability of the MPSM, which deal with chemistry, amount, lattice parameter, elemental partitioning, atomic-site occupancy and stability of precipitated phases of either superalloy or heat-resistant steel samples analyzed. Successful applications of the MPSM not only show a significant improvement for difficulties in accurate quantification in phase chemistry under the EPMA/SEM-EDS measurement conditions but also provide with a useful and helpful tool to determine some other important physical quantities in alloys and steels, which make it possible to quantitatively and more widely evaluate structure-property relationships of the materials investigated through analyzing their bulk samples under EPMA/SEM-EDS measurement conditions.

SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB NiAlCr-X overlay coatings deposited by magnetron sputtering on IN100 and CMSX-4 superalloys and thereafter top-coated with 7YSZ thermal barrier coatings by EB-PVD were investigated with emphasis on the effects of superalloy type and Hf or Zr doping. The sputtered films in the "as coated" condition (after EB-PVD deposition) showed strong diffusion effects of different elements from the superalloys. The measured phase content of beta and gamma' was in good agreement with calculated data obtained from experimental compositions normalized to a Ni-Al-Cr system following the guidelines of site preference of ternary alloying elements. Microstructure evolution and failure characteristics after furnace cyclic tests at 1100 degrees C were investigated as well. The lifetime of the coatings is equivalent to standard MCrAlY TBCs systems and is compared to PtAl and NiCoCrAlY coatings from literature. The effects of microstructure and elements diffusing from the substrates into the bond coat (Ti, Co, Mo and Ta) in combination with the effect of Hf- or Zr-doping is presented and discussed.

AB In recent years great efforts have been made in the development of gamma-TiAl alloys for use in aerospace applications such as turbines, where low densities and high temperature strength are required. However, gamma-TiAl alloys show poor oxidation resistance at temperatures T > 850 degrees C due to the formation of a non-protective oxide layer consisting of a mixture of TiO2 + Al2O3 in air, which could be easily spalled off, resulting in a shortened lifetime of the components. One promising way to overcome this problem is the deposition of an oxidation protective coating with low oxygen permeability at high temperatures. However, the interdiffusion between coating and substrate is still challenging even for advanced oxidation resistant coatings such as MCrAlY (M = Ni or Co) and aluminide. The present work focuses on the (Cr,Al)ON coating system, inspired from its outstanding diffusion barrier properties. Four (Cr,Al)ON coatings with different Cr:Al and N:O ratios were deposited onto gamma-TiAl substrate by the innovative High-Speed Physical Vapor Deposition (HS-PVD) technology, which enables the deposition of oxygen-rich coatings in a stable plasma process without target poisoning. Basing on hollow cathode discharge (HCD) and gas flow sputtering (GFS), the HS-PVD made it possible to deposit (Cr,Al)ON coatings at a deposition rate ds/dt > 16 mu m/h. The as-deposited coatings show an X-ray amorphous structure. Subsequently, the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis confirmed the nanocomposite coating structure. The thermal stability and oxidation behavior of the coatings were evaluated by means of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetry (TGA) between T = 100 degrees C and T = 950 degrees C. It was confirmed that the Xray amorphous structure even remained stable at temperatures up to T = 950 degrees C. Moreover, cross-sectional SEM images of the coated samples after the HT-XRD measurements showed neither the formation of oxides at the coating substrate interface nor the interdiffusion of Ti into the coating, indicating a promising performance of the diffusion barrier. The results of the conducted research reveal a high potential of the HS-PVD deposited (Cr,Al)ON coatings for the oxidation protection of gamma-TiAl at T > 850 degrees C in turbine applications.

TI Microstructural characteristics of the nickel-based alloy IN738LC and
   the cobalt-based alloy Mar-M509 produced by selective laser melting
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB This study investigates selective laser melting (SLM) of the nickel based superalloy IN738LC and the cobalt based alloy Mar-M509, and identifies the influence of process and material parameters on the resulting microstructure. Comprehensive microstructural characterization was performed using electron backscattered diffraction analysis. Significant differences between IN738LC and Mar-M509 were observed with respect to grain size, grain shape and texture sharpness. Alloy IN738LC exhibits coarse and elongated grains with a sharp texture and thus a pronounced mechanical anisotropy. Alloy Mar-M509 shows smaller grains with only moderate structural and mechanical anisotropy. The different micro structural and mechanical characteristics are attributed to the different recovery and recrystallization behavior of IN738LC and Mar-M509. The high stacking fault energy (SFE) of IN738LC results in pronounced recovery of lattice defects without affecting the basic grain structure, whereas the low SFE in Mar-M509 favors recrystallization with the effect of significant grain refinement and weakening of the solidification texture. The effect of microstructure and the structural anisotropy on the orientation-dependent values of the Young's modulus and the mechanical properties are further discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TI Solidification and Segregation Behavior of Cast Ni-Base Superalloy IN792
SO RARE METAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING
AB The solidification process of cast Ni-base superalloy IN792 was comparatively investigated by differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) and isothermal solidification quenching (ISQ) experiment. The distribution characteristics of elements in solidified solid and residual liquid at different temperatures were also concerned. The isothermal solidification microstructure, the phase precipitation diagram, the solidification characteristic curve and the segregation behavior of elements at different temperatures in liquidus and solidus range were obtained. The results of ISQ indicate that the IN792 alloy possesses a liquidus temperature of 1328 degrees C. The onset of MC carbides and eutectic (gamma+gamma') formation take place at 1310 and 1225 degrees C, respectively. The secondary gamma' is precipitated at 1190 degrees C. The macro-solidus temperature determined by DSC was 1250 degrees C. The volume fraction of residual liquid at this temperature can reach about 5%. The end of the solidification happened at 1180 degrees C, designated as micro-solidus temperature. No liquid remained at this temperature. There is a 70 degrees C gap between macro and micro-solidus temperature. The hot tearing tends to occur in this temperature range. About 85 vol% solid phase was formed within a range of 30 degrees C below the liquidus temperature. In 1300 similar to 1270 degrees C range, the residual liquid in the interdendritic region changed from connected channels to the isolated micro-liquid pools, which is related to the formation of micro-porosity defect. The distribution coefficient of element W and Co are more than 1, indicating that they tend to distribute in solid phase in dendritic region, which are negative segregation elements. The distribution coefficients of element Zr, Mo, Ti, Ta and Cr are less than 1, indicating that they tend to distribute in liquid phase in interdendritic region, which are positive segregation elements. The element Al tends to distribute to liquid phase at the beginning of the solidification, and then be prone to concentrate in the solid phase in the dendritic region and transform to a negative segregation element followed by the solidification temperature decreased. The distribution coefficient of element Al and Ni increases but Mo and Cr decreases followed by the solidification temperature decreasing in 1325 similar to 1210 degrees C range. On the contrary, The distribution of element Al and Ni decreases but Mo and Cr increases followed by the solidification temperature decreasing in 1210 similar to 1180 degrees C range.

AB Wear resistant and corrosion resistant surfaces are important for medical implants. Wear resistance is especially important for articulating surfaces in load bearing applications such as total hip and total knee replacements. Metal-on-polyethylene bearings result in relative large volumetric wear, ceramics such as alumina have an excellent wear resistance but are brittle, metal-on-metal bearings have good wear resistance, but release nanometric debris and ions that may cause allergy or have toxic effects. Hard ceramic coatings on metal substrates may be a good solution: low wear and low ion release and ductile metal alloy interior-no danger of brittle fracture and easy shaping. Ti alloys such as for example Ti-6Al-4 have the best combination of mechanical properties and biocompatibility, but have very poor wear resistance, Co-Cr-Mo have good wear resistance, but may cause allergy. TiN hard coatings deposited on Ti alloys by PVD have relatively poor adhesion to the substrate as a result limited durability. Hard coatings formed on the surface of Ti alloys, Zr as well as CoCrMo alloys by reactive diffusion have good adhesion to the substrate as a result of gradual change of composition and gradual change of hardness. Reactive diffusion coatings obtained employing developed Powder Immersion Reaction Assisted Coating (PIRAC) on articulating surfaces of Ti alloys and CoCrMo show excellent adhesion to the substrate. Total hip implants show good performance in wear simulator tests as well as in vivo tests in canine and rat models. The thickness of reactive diffusion coatings is proportional to square root from time. It is shown that that thicker TiN coatings can be obtained via 3 stage PIRAC process: nitriding followed by tiatanization and additional PIRAC nitriding. Similar approach in two stages-titanizaton followed by nitriding can be employed for processing on TiN based coatings on CoCrMo alloy. Duplex TiN coatin-TiN PIRAC coating followed by TiN plasma assisted PVD (PAPVD) results in thick coatings with excellent adhesion to the substrate. PIRAC titanization followed by was successfully used for conversion of Ni foam to NiTi Nitinol foam and formation of TiN coating on the surface of Nitinol foam, resulting in 10 fold decrease of Ni ions release into physiological solution. PIRAC nitriding was successfully used also for nitriding of TiNb alloys, Zr and Zr-2.5 Nb alloy. Two stage coating by wear resistant TiN based layer can be applied to steels, BCC metals such as Mo and W and Ni based superalloys.

AB Creep degradation of an IN738C superalloy after long-term thermal exposure in an atmospheric furnace was investigated by means of accelerated creep tests. Experimental observation showed that the minimum creep rate increased by increasing the exposure time or exposure temperature and is a key factor for predicting creep life during long time, high temperature service. Concerning the exposure temperature and time, an empirical equation has been presented to estimate the creep lives of the pre-exposed specimens. Furthermore, the accuracy of the Monkman-Grant (Proceedings of ASTM, Vol. 56, pp. 593-620) relationship has been verified by experimental results.

TI Diffusion coefficients of transition metals in fcc cobalt
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB Using first-principles density functional theory (DFT), we calculate the diffusivities of 32 different solute elements all transition metals, together with Al and Si in fcc cobalt within the formalism of the five frequency model. For self-diffusion in fcc cobalt, we compare the accuracy of various approximations to the exchange-correlation energy functional of DFT in estimating the activation energy, and find that only the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) approximation agrees well with experimental reports and all other functionals largely overestimate it. Our calculations also show that an accurate estimation of the self diffusion coefficient requires explicit calculation of the effective jump frequency and vacancy formation entropy via phonons. Using accurate self-diffusion data and scaling all solute-related attempt frequencies with respect to the attempt frequency for self-diffusion using a simple relation involving the atomic mass and melting temperature of the solute yields solute diffusivities in excellent agreement with experiments, where such data is available. We find that large solutes spontaneously relax toward the nearest neighbor vacancy to relieve the misfit strain, and the extent of this relaxation correlates negatively with the migration energy. Thus, in general, larger solutes have lower migration energies and diffuse faster than smaller solutes in fcc cobalt. However, extremely large solutes, e.g., group III elements Sc, Y, Lu, tend to be trapped in an energy valley located halfway toward the vacancy, and monovacancy mediated diffusion may no longer be valid in such cases. Finally, for all the solutes considered, we systematically tabulate the diffusion-related quantities calculated-diffusion prefactors, migration and activation energies constructing an extensive and accurate first-principles database for solute diffusion in fcc cobalt.

TI Interdiffusion and Atomic Mobilities in fcc Co-Cr-Mo Alloys
SO JOURNAL OF PHASE EQUILIBRIA AND DIFFUSION
AB The diffusion couples of Co-Cr-Mo ternary alloys were prepared and annealed at 1473 K for 72 h in order to determine the interdiffusion coefficients by using the electron probe microanalysis combined with Whittle and Green method. The experimental interdiffusion coefficients were critically assessed to the atomic mobilities by means of DICTRA software package. Good agreements were obtained from comprehensive comparison between the model-predicted diffusion properties and the experimental data, meanwhile, considered that the calculated diffusion coefficients were within the acceptable uncertainty of the experimentally measured diffusion coefficients, which verified the reliability of the atomic mobilities. The diffusion phenomena, such as diffusion paths and the concentration-distance profiles in the Co-Cr-Mo ternary system can be reasonably described by the presently obtained atomic mobilities.

AB Standard reactive element (RE) studies have characterized the behavior of single RE additions such as Y, La or Hf. However, several commercial alumina-forming alloys are "co-doped" with two or more RE additions which allows the total amount of RE dopant in the alloy to be reduced. The oxidation performance of both commercial and laboratory-made co-doped alloys shows better scale adhesion and/or slower scale growth rates than comparable alloys with one RE addition. Characterization of the alumina scales showed no significant change in the grain structure with co-doping; however, as the total RE addition was reduced in co-doped alloys, a smaller volume of RE-rich oxides was observed within the scale. Quantification of the amount of RE ionic segregation on alumina scale grain boundaries formed on single doped and co-doped alloys showed similar amounts of segregation.

SO CORROSION SCIENCE
AB Surface Cr oxidation mechanism of Alloy 617 was investigated in He-CO-CO2 environments with P-co/P-co2 of either 9 or 1320 at temperatures 750-850 degrees C. The activation energy for surface oxidation was 169.0 +/- 13.2 kJ/mol in He-P-co/P-co2 = 9 and 234.4 +/- 8.9 kJ/mol in He-P-co/P-co2 = 1320. The ambient oxygen partial pressure dependence of the measured oxidation rates was consistent with n-type behavior of Cr2O3, in which Cr interstitials are the primary mobile species. The oxidation rates measured were greater than that can be sustained only by lattice diffusion of Cr in Cr2O3, indicating that grain boundary diffusion of Cr plays a role in the Cr2O3 growth kinetics.

The implementation of new Yb: YAG solid laser sources and new optical generations (dynamic focal length; 2in1 fiber:Fiber core and ring core) offers advantages in terms of quality, accuracy, reproducibility and weld dimensions. The LASER beam Yb:YAG of these new sources is generated, no longer from a bar of yttrium-aluminum garnet but from a disk. Moreover, a top-hat shaped power distribution and a top-hat shaped power distribution with a sharply limited recess in the center (ring structure) may be at the focal point using respectively the inner fiber and the coaxial fiber. These technological innovations offer new possibilities for cutting and welding of sheet metal parts. The welding domains of EN AW-6061 aluminum alloy, Commercial Purity Titanium -Grade 2 (T40), AISI 321 stainless steel alloy, nickel based Hastelloy X and Inconel 625 and cobalt based Haynes 188 superalloys are defined according to process parameters such as power density, focal diameter, welding speed and fiber type. Optimal welding parameters are determined for each alloy. The evolution of the microstructures and the mechanical properties of each zone of the welds are explained according to the power density, the heat input energy and the welding speed.

TI Thermal Fatigue Properties of DZ40M Alloy
SO RARE METAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING
AB Thermal fatigue properties of DZ40M directionally solidified cobalt-base superalloy was investigated by scanning electric microscope. The results show that the crack propagation rate increases and the thermal fatigue resistance decreases with the rise of the upper temperature. Resistance of thermal fatigue is improved with the holding time prolonging at the same upper temperature, which is caused by the formation of uniform and compact film of oxide on the surface. Due to different thermal expanding coefficients of the matrix and the carbides, crack holes are easily formed in the boundary of the matrix and carbides at alternating temperatures during thermal fatigue; as a result, cracks of thermal fatigue initiate. The interconnection of crack holes makes thermal fatigue crack propagate.

TI PORE FORMATION IN P/M FERRITIC ODS SUPERALLOYS DURING HIGH-TEMPERATURE
   HEAT-TREATMENT .2. THERMODYNAMIC CONSIDERATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS
SO POWDER METALLURGY INTERNATIONAL
AB The pore formation in ferritic ODS superalloys was investigated.  Thermodynamic calculations were performed in order to obtain estimates of the pressures of gaseous species originating from the alloy system.  The CO pressures originating from dissolved or bonded oxygen and carbon are of the order of 5 . 10(-2) bar or less and thus cannot be responsible for pore formation.  The same is true for nitrogen.  Hydrogen from occluded water vapour could account for local high pressures but due to the high permeation rate of hydrogen, it is very unlikely that the pressure can be sustained for sufficient periods of time.  A model is proposed that could explain the mechanisms of both pore formation and growth.  The mechanisms comprise void coagulation around the primary oxygen-contaminated surfaces caused by stress-induced vacancy migration and oxide shell growth around the pore walls via a reduction mechanism of entrapped water vapour.  Experimental investigations which support these assumptions are presented.

The corrosion of oxide sublayers, as exfoliation of the oxide, was shown. This would appear to be due to diffusion of tritiated species in the oxide. These species accumulate at the oxide-alloy interface, thus modifying the number of charge carriers in the oxide.

AB Oxidized MC carbides which act as main crack initiation sites in a polycrystalline superalloy under thermal-mechanical fatigue (TMF) conditions at 850 degrees C were studied. Microstructural observations in the TMF tested specimens were compared to findings from bulk samples exposed isothermally in air at 850 degrees C for 30 hours in the absence of any external applied load. Carbides were found to oxidize rapidly after exposure at 850 degrees C for 30 hours resulting in surface eruptions corresponding to oxidation products, from where micro-cracks initiated. Plastic deformation due to volume expansion of the often porous oxidized carbides led to high dislocation densities in the adjacent matrix as revealed by controlled electron channeling contrast imaging. The high dislocation density facilitated the dissolution kinetics of gamma' precipitates by segregation and diffusion of chromium and cobalt along the dislocations via pipe diffusion, resulting in the formation of soft recrystallized grains. Atom probe tomography revealed substantial compositional differences between the recrystallized grains and the adjacent undeformed gamma matrix. Similar observations were made for the TMF tested alloy. Our observations provide new insights into the true detrimental role of oxidized MC carbides on the crack initiation performance of polycrystalline superalloys under TMF.

   Experimental characterization and crystal plasticity modeling
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB The deformation behavior of a wrought, cobalt-based superalloy, Haynes 25, was studied using a combination of experimental techniques and crystal plasticity modeling. The microstructure was examined by transmission electron microscopy and electron backscattered diffraction to determine the deformation and hardening mechanisms contributing to the mechanical behavior of the alloy. A high density of stacking faults within the grains, consistent with planar glide, was found to be the predominant defect mechanism with no evidence of deformation twinning observed. A strain-rate and temperature-sensitive hardening law that includes effects of planar glide was developed for the material and implemented in a self-consistent homogenization scheme. The hardening of individual crystals is based on the evolution of dislocation densities per plane and includes the effects of strain rate and temperature through thermally activated recovery and dislocation interactions. The model is validated on a comprehensive set of compression tests performed at temperatures ranging from 298 to 673 K and strain rates ranging from 10(-3) to 2600 s(-1) and found capable of reproducing the stress-strain response and texture for all tests with a unique set of single-crystal hardening parameters.

TI Corrosion resistance of structural materials to Ga2O at 1000 degrees C
SO JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS
AB The thermally-induced gallium removal (TIGR) process is capable of removing gallium from oxide powders through the sublimation of Ga2O at elevated temperatures in a reducing atmosphere. Heat-resistant structural materials typically used in the construction of furnaces and reaction chambers may be susceptible to embrittlement and corrosion in the gallium-rich environment of the TIGR process. The susceptibilities of several heat-resistant structural materials to corrosion in Ga2O-rich atmospheres are experimentally evaluated. Tungsten and SiC are found to be highly resistant to corrosive attack by Ga2O at elevated temperatures. Superalloys containing chromium and cobalt as well as a tungsten alloy containing nickel and copper are found susceptible to corrosive attack by gallium. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

TI Overview on Recent Developments of Bondcoats for Plasma-Sprayed Thermal
   Barrier Coatings
SO JOURNAL OF THERMAL SPRAY TECHNOLOGY
AB The performance of MCrAlY (M = Ni, Co) bondcoats for atmospheric plasma-sprayed thermal barrier coatings (APS-TBCs) is substantially affected by the contents of Co, Ni, Cr, and Al as well as minor additions of Y, Hf, Zr, etc., but also by manufacturing-related properties such as coating thickness, porosity, surface roughness, and oxygen content. The latter properties depend in turn on the exact technology and set of parameters used for bondcoat deposition. The well-established LPPS process competes nowadays with alternative technologies such as HVOF and APS. In addition, new technologies have been developed for bondcoats manufacturing such as high-velocity APS or a combination of HVOF and APS for application of a flashcoat. Future developments of the bondcoat systems will likely include optimization of thermal spraying methods for obtaining complex bondcoat roughness profiles required for extended APS-TBC lifetimes. Introduction of the newest generation single-crystal superalloys possessing low Cr and high Al and refractory metals (Re, Ru) contents will require definition of new bondcoat compositions and/or multilayered bondcoats to minimize interdiffusion issues. The developments of new bondcoat compositions may be substantially facilitated using thermodynamic-kinetic modeling, the vast potential of which has been demonstrated in recent years.

TI SURFACE MODIFICATION AND ITS INFLUENCE ON THE MICROSTRUCTURE AND CREEP
   RESISTANCE OF NICKEL BASED SUPERALLOY RENE 77
SO ARCHIVES OF METALLURGY AND MATERIALS
AB Superalloy Rene 77 is very wide used for turbine blades, turbine disks of aircraft engines which work up to 1050 degrees C. These elements are generally produced by the investment casting method. Turbine blades produced by conventional precision casting methods have coarse and inhomogeneous grain structure. Such a material often does not fulfil basic requirements, which concern mechanical properties for the stuff used in aeronautical engineering. The incorporation of controlled grain size improved mechanical properties. This control of grain size in the casting operation was accomplished by the control of processing parameters such as casting temperature, mould preheating temperature, and the use of grain nucleates in the face of the mould. For nickel and cobalt based superalloys, it was found that cobalt aluminate (CoAl2O4) has the best nucleating effect. The objective of this work was to determine the influence of the inoculant's content (cobalt aluminate) in the surface layer of the ceramic mould on the microstructure and mechanical properties at high temperature of nickel based superalloy Rene 77. For this purpose, the ceramic moulds were made with different concentration of cobalt aluminate in the primary slurry was from 0 to 10% mass. in zirconium flour. Stepped and cylindrical samples were casted for microstructure and mechanical examinations. The average grain size of the matrix (gamma phase), was determined on the stepped samples. The influence of surface modification on the grain size of up to section thickness was considered. The microstructure investigations with the use of light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) enable to examine the influence of the surface modification on the morphology of gamma' phase and carbides precipitations. Verification of the influence of CoAl2O4 on the mechanical properties of castings were investigated on the basis of results obtained form creep tests.

AB The effect of ceramic shell strength on hot tearing susceptibility during solidification was inspected practicing investment casting of the cobalt-base superalloy samples with the same casting conditions, but different ceramic shell systems. Results showed that the lower the ceramic shell strength upon using polymer additives, the lower the hindered contraction rate, and the lower the hindered contraction rate, the smaller the hot tearing tendency. Optical microscopy and electron microscopy scanning revealed that the hot tear propagated along the last solidified interdendritic phase, and that the hot tear surface had two major modes: 1) the ductile region in the outer layer; and 2) the inner region of liquid embrittlement.

TI EFFECTS OF HIGH-TEMPERATURE AGING ON THE CREEP-RUPTURE PROPERTIES OF
   HIGH-TUNGSTEN COBALT-BASE SUPERALLOYS
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB The effects of high-temperature ageing on creep-rupture properties were studied using cobalt-base superalloys containing about 14-20 wt % tungsten (W) at 1089 K (816-degrees-C) and 1311 K (1038-degrees-C) in air. A high-temperature ageing for 1080 ks at 1273 K after solution treatment caused grain-boundary and matrix precipitates of W solid solution and carbide phases in these alloys, and grain boundaries were serrated especially in the alloys with higher W content. The high-temperature ageing largely improved the rupture life in the alloys with higher W content, particularly under lower stresses at 1089 K, whereas it caused the creep ductility to decrease a little in the alloy containing 20% W. The high-temperature ageing also improved the rupture life without decreasing creep ductility in these alloys under higher stresses at 1311 K. Under the same ageing conditions of 1080 ks at 1273 K, the initiation of grain-boundary cracks was retarded in the solution-treated and aged specimens, as well as in the aged specimens with serrated grain boundaries, for the alloys with higher W content at both 1089 and 1311 K. A large amount of grain-boundary serration also occurred in the non-aged specimens of the alloys with higher W content during creep at 1311 K, and contributed to the strengthening of the alloys. The solution-treated and aged specimen had almost the same rupture strength as the aged specimens with serrated grain boundaries in these cobalt-base alloys. The rupture strength of the solution-treated and aged specimens largely increased with increasing W content under the lower stresses at 1089 K and under the higher stresses at 1311 K. A ductile grain-boundary fracture surface, which was composed of dimples and grain-boundary ledges associated with grain-boundary precipitates, was observed in the solution-treated and aged specimens, as well as in the aged specimens with serrated grain boundaries at both 1089 and 1311 K. The fracture surface of the non-aged specimens was a brittle grain-boundary facet at 1089 K, but it became a ductile grain-boundary fracture surface, as serrated grain boundaries were formed owing to grain-boundary precipitates occurring during creep at 1311 K.

SO METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND
   MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB L605 (20Cr-15W-10Ni wt pct) and CCM (28Cr-6Mo wt pct) cobalt-based superalloys are candidates for a wide range of applications, from gas turbine components to biomedical implants. Attention is currently focused on the optimization of grain structure as an appropriate approach to increase yield stress without affecting significantly the ductility. In this study, the Laser Ultrasonics for Metallurgy (LUMet) technology is used to examine in situ the evolution of the mean grain size associated with recrystallization and grain growth during heat treatments from the cold-rolled state. The recrystallization process is completed at 1373 K (1100 A degrees C) for L605 and 1273 K (1000 A degrees C) for CCM. The subsequent grain growth rate in L605 is larger compared to CCM. Continuous measurements of the grain size evolution are found to be consistent with grain growth affected by solute drag. Through in situ measurements, the laser ultrasonic technology significantly accelerates the determination of metallurgical parameters allowing for fast optimization of process parameters required to meet specific applications.

TI Alloying solid solution strengthening of Fe-Ga alloys: a

SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS D-APPLIED PHYSICS
AB First-principles spin polarized calculations have been implemented by using the Discrete Molecular (DMol3) package to investigate the strengthening effects of alloying addition including Nb, Mo, V and Co in a cubic solid solution of Fe - Ga alloys. Mayer bond order values were used to evaluate the atomic bond strengths in the alloys and were then used to assess the alloying strengthening characteristics. Results from the calculations suggest that the transition metal Nb achieves the best strengthening effect in Fe - Ga alloys. The solid solution strengthening follows a decreasing order trend from larger to smaller from Nb, Mo, V to Co. The effect of Ga on individual bond strength variations between Fe and alloying elements and also on alloying strengthening was examined.

AB Laser-assisted forming is a method based on contactless shaping of profiles with the use of a laser beam impact. This method has been developed from the early 1980s by the Centre for Laser Technology of Metals at the Kielce University of Technology (PSk) and the Polish Academy of Sciences (PAN), among others [1-7]. In general, the mechanism allowing for changing the shape of profiles is the material's thermal expansion. Suitable profile heating (on programmed paths with an adequately selected temperature, etc.) allows for obtaining the planned shapes.
   Despite certain areas of application (electrical mechanics, precision mechanics, micro-positioning and others), this method is ineffective [4-5]. When changing the shape of large-diameter profiles, this method is power and time consuming, thereby eliminating it from industrial applications. Thus, the concept of a hybrid method was created, i.e. laser forming with mechanical assistance.
   In 2015, PSk established co-operation with the Metal Forming Institute (INOP) in Poznan, PAN's Institute of Fundamental Technological Research, and the Rzeszow University of Technology in terms of research in the aforementioned topic. The above consortium commenced the execution of the project titled "Laser forming of thin-walled profiles with mechanical assistance, financed by the National Centre for Research and Development as part of subsidy no. PBS3/A5/47/2015.
   The paper's authors will present, among other things, the main concept of hybrid laser and mechanical forming, one of the concepts selected for the execution, design and construction of a station for bending thin-walled tubes and cone diffusers used in the construction of aircraft engines. The target materials of the research are Inconel 618 and Inconel 625 refractory nickel superalloys, as well as AISI 410 and AISI 325 heat-resistant Martensitic steels. These materials, due to their good mechanical properties when working at higher temperatures, are used for building turboprop engines. For economic reasons, the testing was conducted on X5CrNi18-10 acid-resistant austenitic steel. The hybrid method (assumptions, concept, design) presented in the paper was subjected to validation in laboratory conditions. The testing featured measurements of the forces required to obtain plastic deformations in the profile, bending angle, and determination of the process temperature. Furthermore, the paper will feature a presentation of future plans concerning the work executed as part of the said project.

The electrochemical apparatus was used to determine the formal potential of some redox couples, to identify the corrosion reactions and to evaluate the corrosion rates.
   Among tested metals, only chromium is a passivable material. The passivation is due to the formation of a chromium oxide (Cr2O3) protective layer at the glass/metal interface.

SO PROGRESS IN NATURAL SCIENCE-MATERIALS INTERNATIONAL
AB Owning to their excellent thermal stability and high strength at elevated temperature, high entropy alloys (HEAs) possess great potential for the application in aviation and aerospace fields. In present work, two novel Nb-Ni-Ti-Co-Zr and Nb-Ni-Ti-Co-Zr-Hf HEAs were prepared by arc melting and copper mold suction-casting method. The microstructure, phase stability, mechanical properties at room temperature and elevated temperature of the two HEAs were studied. Both of the HEAs possess high yield stress at room temperature, especially for the Nb-Ni-Ti-Co-Zr (with 2331 Mpa). In addition, the Nb-Ni-Ti-Co-Zr HEA exhibited high yield stress of 564 Mpa at elevated temperature of 800 degrees C and large compressive plastic strain (more than 50% at 800 degrees C). Nb-Ni-Ti-Co-Zr-Hf alloy showed new phase precipitation at 800 degrees C, whereas the structure of Nb-Ni-Ti-Co-Zr was more stable, which is one of the reason why it possesses high strength at room temperature and elevated temperature. The high temperature properties of the Nb-Ni-Ti-Co-Zr HEA make it promising for high temperature application. (C) 2015 The Authors.

TI Lattice stability and the effect of Co and Re on the ideal strength of
   Ni: First-principles study of uniaxial tensile deformation
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB Using first-principles density functional calculations, lattice stability of gamma - Ni under [001], [110], and [111] uniaxial tensions and the effect of alloying elements Co and Re on the uniaxial tensile behavior of gamma - Ni were studied in this paper. With elastic constants and phonon spectra calculations, we examined the mechanical stability and phonon stability of Ni during the uniaxial tensions along the three characteristic directions. The results show that the mechanical stability and phonon stability of a lattice occurs before the maximum stress-strain point under the [001] and [111] tension, respectively. The effects of Co and Re on the ideal tensile strength of gamma - Ni show a significant directivity: Co and Re have little effect on the stresses in [001] and [111] directions, but increases the ideal strength of the system in the weakest uniaxial tensile direction. Moreover, the strengthening effect of Re is significantly better than that of Co. By further analyzing electronic structure, it is found that the effect of alloying elements on the uniaxial tensile behavior of g -Ni comes from their interactions with host atoms.

TI Effect of Microstructure Evolution on Micro/Nano-Mechanical Property of
   Fe-Co-Ni Ternary Alloys Solidified under Microgravity Condition
SO STEEL RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL
AB Rapid solidification of highly undercooled Fe-Co-Ni alloys is realized by drop tube technique. The microstructures of Fe-10%Co-10%Ni, Fe-15.6%Co-12%Ni, and Fe-10%Co-20%Ni alloys are all composed of single alpha(Fe) solid solution phase, which are confirmed by the results of XRD and DSC. With the decrease of droplet diameters, the cooling rate and undercooling increase, meanwhile, the microstructural characteristic of alpha(Fe) phase transforms from coarse dendrites to equiaxed grains. The size of coarse dendrites decreases to one tenth for the refined equiaxed grains. Employing the Vickers hardness and nano indenter techniques, the mechanical properties of alpha(Fe) dendrites are investigated. The average Vickers microhardness of alpha(Fe) phase is remarkably enhanced with the decrease of the grain size. Due to the more homogenous solute distribution in the dendrite trunks, the nanohardness presents a gentle fluctuation. Once the droplet diameter exceeds a critical value, the solutes concentrate at the grain boundaries. As a result, the closer the indenters to the grain boundary, the larger the nanohardness.

TI A comparative study on the microstructures and mechanical properties
   between surfacing nickel-based superalloy and surfacing cobalt-based
   superalloy
SO MATERIALS RESEARCH EXPRESS
AB Surfacing gradient layers using different materials on the surface of die is an efficient way to improve its service life, especially under extreme high temperature and high pressure. To obtain superior high-temperature stability, a cobalt-based superalloy welding material, JLCo32 and a nickel-based superalloy welding material, CHN327 were both designed in this study as surface layers which welded on the die manufactured by bimetal-layer surfacing technology. Arc surfacing of the two kinds of superalloy was conducted on ferrous alloys matrix, and ten cycles of heating to 700 degrees C with a speed of 2 degrees C s(-1) followed by water quenching were operated to simulate the temperature cycles of dies in service. Changes of the microstructures before and after cycles of heating and water quenching were characterized by means of optical microscopy (OM), x-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results indicated that, after ten cycles of heating and water quenching, the major precipitates of JLCo32 were carbides and there were more gamma '' phases in CHN327. The mechanical properties of the surfacing layer were investigated by microhardness tests and shear tests. High-temperature tensile tests at different temperatures were performed to examine the high-temperature behaviour of these two kinds of superalloy. Experimental results showed that, compared with CHN327, JLCo32 exhibits higher microhardness and more reliable bonding with ferrous alloy matrix. For the two superalloys, microhardness near the welding line tend to increase after cycles of heating and water quenching attributed to the diffusion of strengthening elements. Furthermore, in comparison to CHN327, JLCo32 own superior yield strength and ultimate tensile strength but inferior ductility.

TI Corrosion behavior of metals in rowing Ar-42.6%O-2-14.7%Br-2 gas mixture

SO CORROSION
AB The corrosion behavior of pure metals that form the basis of high-temperature superalloys has been investigated in an Ar-42.6%O-2-14.7%Br-2 gas mixture at 700 degrees C. which was one of the environments encountered in the University of Tokyo (UT)-3 thermochemical water decomposition reaction process to produce hydrogen. The test metals were nickel, chromium, cobalt. copper. iron, titanium, hafnium, zirconium, molybdenum. niobium. tantalum, and tungsten. Thermodynamic phase stability diagrams were constructed for nickel, chromium, iron. cobalt. titanium, tungsten, and zirconium to predict the stable. condensed corrosion products, and the oxides were predicted to be thermodynamically stable phases. Postreaction characterization of the test metals included discontinuous mass-change measurements. scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive x-ray analysis, and x-ray diffraction. Xray diffraction identified oxides as corrosion products for all metals. But low-melting metal bromides Were also detected for titanium. tungsten. molybdenum, copper, and iron; these caused rapid consumption of the metals. Although scanning electron microscopy revealed chromium oxide (Cr2O3) scale formation on chromium, energy-dispersive x-ray analysis identified bromine-containing species at the cracked scale/metal interface.

TI Improvement of wear resistance of hot working tool steel by hardfacing -
   Part 1 - Effect of microstructure and hardness
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Hardfacing is one of the most useful and economical ways to improve the performance of components subjected to severe wear conditions. The aim of the present work was to investigate the influence of hardfacing on the hardness and wear resistance of a hot working tool steel. Two cobalt based and one nickel based superalloys were used as hardfacing materials. Stellite 6 and 21 were deposited on H11 steel via tungsten inert gas (TIG) and shielded metal arc welding and Inconel 625 was deposited by TIG welding techniques. The pin on disc high temperature wear tests were carried out on hardfaced materials. The worn surfaces were also characterised using SEM and X-ray diffraction methods. The results showed that TIG hardfacings process having a low dilution, owing to the refined solidification structure and high capacity of work hardening enhances better wear resistance.

TI Experimental investigation of Ti-Nb-Co ternary system at 1000 degrees C
SO MATERIALS & DESIGN
AB The phase relations in the Ti-Nb-Co system are of great importance for the design of high temperature Ti alloys. The isothermal section of Ti-Nb-Co system at 1000 degrees C has been established using one diffusion couple supplemented with 13 key alloys. Phase relations and ternary solubility of the binary compounds were determined using electron probe microscopy (EPMA), wave dispersive X-ray spectrometer (WDS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques. There are 19 two-phase equilibria and 9 three-phase equilibria in the isothermal section at 1000 degrees C. The determined maximum solubility of Nb in TiCo3, TiCo2 (h), TiCo2 (c), TiCo, Ti2Co were 6.22, 17.21, 2.29, 22.88 and 2.49 at.%, respectively. Nb2Co7, NbCo3, NbCo2, Nb6Co7 dissolves up about 0.33, 17.75, 13.26 and 10.81 at.% Ti, respectively. All of the binary phases have a certain composition range at 1000 degrees C except Nb2Co7. The phase diagram of Ti-Nb-Co system varied greatly when the temperature raised from 900 degrees C to 950 degrees C, but the changes was not so big when temperature increased from 950 degrees C to 1000 degrees C.

AB Cast NiCrAl alloys with additions of Y, La, Hf and Ti were evaluated at 1100 degrees C in wet (10 and 50% H2O) and dry air (0% H2O) in order to optimize such dopants for superalloy bond coatings. The results suggest that the typical Y addition in most coatings could be replaced by La. Also, scale adhesion in cyclic testing was improved with the co-addition of Hf with La or Y. Ti was added to investigate its incorporation in coatings on superalloys containing significant Ti additions. Particularly with co-doped alloys, the addition of Ti had little effect on scale adhesion but did reduce the depth of internal oxidation. Water vapor increased spallation, especially for the least adherent alloys, such as Y,Ti-doped NiCrAl. For the co-doped compositions with Hf, water vapor had a limited effect on scale adhesion and on the alumina growth rate in isothermal exposures. In addition to specimen mass change, the extent of internal oxidation and the depletion of beta phase in the substrate were evaluated. Analytical transmission electron microscopy showed that Y, La and Hf co-segregated to the alumina scale grain boundaries and formed dopant-rich oxide precipitates in the scale.

SO METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND
   MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB A methodology for determining the preferred site occupancy of various alloying elements within ordered gamma' precipitates was developed and applied to Rene88 samples. The method utilized atom probe tomography and X-ray diffraction techniques with controlled monochromated synchrotron beams to determine element positions. Samples were solutionized at 1423 K (1150 degrees C) for 30 minutes and cooled at 24 K/min with subsequent aging at 1033 K (760 degrees C). The synchrotron X-ray diffraction results indicate that niobium prefers to reside on the aluminum sublattice site of the gamma' phase. Additionally, the results indicate that chromium prefers the nickel sublattice sites, while cobalt is likely to occupy both the aluminum and nickel sublattice sites. The X-ray results on the chromium occupancy disagree with atom probe results from the same alloy that indicate that chromium prefers the aluminum sublattice sites.

TI The effects of hard lubricant coatings on the performance of
   electro-plated superabrasive grinding wheels
SO ADVANCES IN ABRASIVE TECHNOLOGY V
SE KEY ENGINEERING MATERIALS
AB Electro-plated superabrasive grinding wheels are gaining popularity in the areas of high-speed machining. They can now be found in the tool banks of multi-axis milling machines, used in the machining of relatively soft, stainless steels and nickel and cobalt based superalloys. These materials not only cause significant wear of the abrasive grain but moreover, tend to clog and load the grinding wheel, rendering it prematurely inoperable. A means of extending the life of an electro-plated wheel is therefore needed when grinding these "gummy" materials. The use of coatings to improve the performance of cutting tools for use in "large chip" machining like turning, milling, drilling and tapping applications has been shown to be successful, and is widely used. Initially, the coatings provided some wear resistance. Later, coatings were developed for thermal insulation and oxidation resistance. Lately, hard lubricant coatings have shown promise, particularly when used in dry and quasi-dry machining applications. The wear resistant coatings of titanium nitride and titanium carbide have been explored with little success in abrasive machining and grinding applications, in industry. The wear resistant coatings used in "large chip" machining never found a place in "small chip" grinding processes. This paper explores the effects of hard lubricant coatings in industry as well as in the laboratory using both force and power measurement for process evaluation. The results show that a significant improvement may be made in electro-plated cBN wheel performance using a hard lubricant coating system, particularly when grinding the soft and low machinability index materials typically used in the medical and aerospace industries.

TI High Modulus Reinforcement Alloys
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON APPLIED SUPERCONDUCTIVITY
AB Materials used as reinforcement for conductors in high-field magnets require both a high capacity for load bearing and a high resistance to deformation under stress; that is, a high value for tensile strength and a high modulus of elasticity. In addition, compatibility between the magnet conductor and any proposed reinforcement materials has to be carefully evaluated in terms of their capability for thermal expansion, stability at high temperature, resistance to oxidation, and crack propagation. We investigated a number of (nickel based and nickel-cobalt based) superalloys designed for high-temperature applications. These superalloys have higher Young's modulus than the stainless steels that are currently used as reinforcement materials for high-field magnets. Our test materials were subjected to thermo-mechanical processing that strengthens the alloys by forming very fine particles within them. Our initial work focused on changes that occured in the alloy during deformation at either cryogenic or room temperature. Because we observed distinct interfaces between the particles and the matrix, we decided that these materials could be described as precipitate-strengthened alloys. Both the strengthening component area and the matrix had more resistance to plastic deformation at cryogenic temperatures, than at room temperatures. In some cases, we further enhanced the strength of the alloy by doping them with other elements. In all the cases, these alloys permitted more efficient performance of conductors by shareing more of the load than would be possible with stainless steel reinforcement materials. This paper outlines the properties of these new alloys and establishes their compatibility with certain conductors commonly used for high-field magnets.

TI Ionic segregation on grain boundaries in thermally grown alumina scales
SO MATERIALS AT HIGH TEMPERATURES
AB This study first examined segregation behaviour in the alumina scale formed after 100 h at 1100 degrees C on bare and MCrAlYHfSi-coated single-crystal superalloys with similar to 10 ppma La and Y. For the bare superalloy, Hf and Ti were detected on the grain boundaries of the inner columnar alumina layer. Increasing the oxidation temperature to 1200 degrees C for 2 h did not change the segregation behaviour. With the bond coating, both Y and Hf were segregated to the grain boundaries as expected. However, there was evidence of Ti-rich oxide particles near the gas interface suggesting that Ti diffused from the superalloy through the coating. To further understand these segregation observations with multiple dopants, other alumina-forming systems were examined. Alumina scale grain boundary co-segregation of Ti with Y is common for FeCrAl alloys. Co-segregation of Hf and Ti was observed in the scale formed on co-doped NiAl. No La segregation was detected in the scale formed on NiCrAl with only a 19 ppma La addition, however, the scale was adherent.

TI CONTROL OF MICROSTRUCTURES BY HEAT TREATMENTS AND HIGH-TEMPERATURE
   PROPERTIES IN HIGH-TUNGSTEN COBALT-BASE SUPERALLOYS
SO HANDBOOK OF MATERIAL SCIENCE RESEARCH
SE Materials Science and Technologies
AB Cobalt-base HS-21 (L-605) alloy has high strength and good oxidation resistance at high temperatures, and is widely used for high-temperature components including blades, vanes and combustor parts in the hot sections of jet engines. In this study, effects of microstructures on the creep-rupture properties were investigated on the heat-treated specimens of the HS-25 (L-605) type heat-resistant alloys containing about 14 to 20% (mass %) tungsten (W) at 1089 and 1311 K. Serrated grain boundaries which were formed by precipitation of W-rich phase and M(6)C carbide by heat treatment, improved rupture strength without significant loss of creep ductility. Ageing for 1080 ks (300 h) at 1273 K (1000 degrees C) caused similar precipitates on grain boundaries and in grains, and also increased rupture strength in the specimens with normal straight grain boundaries. Improvement of the rupture properties by heat treatments was remarkable in the alloys with the higher W content at 1089 K, while such heat treatments were effective in relatively short-term creep at 1311 K. In the non-aged specimens with straight grain boundaries, the rupture strength increased with increasing W content at 13 11 K, although the rupture strength was not improved largely with increasing W content at 1089 K. The principal strengthening mechanism in these alloys was attributed to the strengthening of grain boundaries and grains by precipitates of W-rich phase and carbide phases in addition to solid-solution strengthening by W atoms. The strengthening of grains by high-temperature ageing was comparable with the strengthening by serrated grain boundaries in the high-tungsten cobalt-base alloys at 1089 K. Fracture surfaces of specimens with serrated grain boundaries and those of aged specimens were ductile grain-boundary fracture surfaces with small dimples and ledges, while the non-aged specimens with straight grain boundaries exhibited brittle grain-boundary facets at 1089 K.

TI Viscoplastic constitutive equations of combustion chamber materials
   including cyclic hardening and dynamic strain aging
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLASTICITY
AB Cobalt-base and nickel-base superalloys for aircraft engine combustion chamber applications (e.g. Haynes 188, Haynes 230, Hastelloy X) show a complex viscoplastic behavior. In a large temperature range from 300 to 800 degrees C, an important cyclic hardening with memory effects combined with a negative strain rate sensitivity are observed. This behavior can be related to the dynamic strain aging phenomenon. The present contribution aims at proposing a set of constitutive equations that are able to predict those experimental observations. A classical unified viscoplastic framework is coupled with a physically motivated macroscopic modeling of dynamic strain aging initially introduced by McCormick and Kubin, Estrin. The complete model has been identified on original multilevel and multirate cyclic experiments and cyclic relaxation experiments on the Haynes 188 alloy. The predictive abilities of the model are demonstrated by simulations of a large set of experimental data including fatigue tests from the literature. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Wear resistant carbon fiber reinforced Stellite alloy composites
SO MATERIALS & DESIGN
AB Stellite alloys are a family of cobalt-based superalloys that are the main engineering materials used for severe corrosion, wear and high temperature environments. These alloys are strengthened by various carbides. However, the presence of carbides can cause many problems although they are main agents for wear resistance. This research attempts to develop a class of novel composite materials which substitute carbon of Stellite alloys with carbon fiber, aiming to minimize the disadvantageous effects of carbides in the alloys. Two types of carbon fiber, plain carbon fiber and nickel-coated carbon fiber, are employed in the composites. The new materials are fabricated using hot isostatic pressing (HIP) technique. The microstructures of these composites are analyzed to investigate if any carbides are induced due to incorporating carbon fibers. The tribological properties of these new composites are characterized on a pin-on-disk tribometer. The experimental results show that the developed composites exhibit better wear resistance than that of medium-carbon Stellite alloys and comparable wear resistance to that of high-carbon Stellite alloys.

TI The detection and sizing of flaws in components from the hot-end of gas
   turbines using phase-contrast radiography with neutrons: a feasibility
   study
SO NDT & E INTERNATIONAL
AB In this paper we present a feasibility study of the use of phase contrast radiography in the examination of components from the hot-section of gas turbine engines. These components are usually made from dense materials (nickel or cobalt based superalloys) and, consequently, radiographic examination requires either high energy X-rays (above 60 keV) or neutrons. The relative merits of employing X-rays and neutrons for phase contrast radiography are compared. It is shown that, for similar penetration, neutrons offer better sensitivity and that it should be possible to detect even micron-wide cracks orientated perpendicular to the incident rays. Simulation shows that, for cracks parallel to the incident rays, crack growth in increments of microns can be resolved by monitoring the development of the Fresnel diffraction pattern. Some preliminary experimental results are also presented that demonstrate an improvement over conventional neutron radiography. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI FORMATION OF CONDENSED CHLORIDES DURING MIXED OXIDATION CHLORINATION OF
   IRON AT 1000-K
SO CORROSION
AB The mixed oxidation-chlorination of iron in gas mixtures of Ar, O2, and Cl2 at 1000 K has been investigated by thermogravimetric analysis and examination of the corrosion products by optical and scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction analysis.  Vapor phase transport of iron chlorides influences the rate of oxidation-chlorination when the concentration of chlorine in the gas mixture is low.  When the concentration of chlorine in the gas mixture is high enough to support the formation of a liquid iron chloride deposit on the corroding surface, fluxing of the oxide scale can produce much faster corrosion than is observed in lower chlorine environments.  An equation is proposed to predict the conditions under which this form of attack can occur.  Because the vapor pressure of iron chloride increases rapidly with temperature, this form of corrosion can only occur in a narrow range of temperatures just above the melting point of FeCl2.

TI Cyclic Oxidation and Hot Corrosion Behavior of Plasma-Sprayed CoCrAlY
   plus WC-Co Coating on Turbine Alloys
SO JOURNAL OF FAILURE ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION
AB Components in energy-producing systems suffer a variety of degradation processes such as oxidation and molten salt-induced corrosion as a consequence of complex multi-component gaseous environment. Coatings provide a composition that will grow the protective scale at high temperatures having long-term stability. Plasma spraying was used to deposit CoCrAlY + WC-Co composite coatings on turbine alloys of Hastelloy X and AISI 321. The thermocyclic oxidation behavior of coated alloys was investigated in static air and in molten salt (Na2SO4-60%V2O5) environment at 700 degrees C. The thermogravimetric technique was used to approximate the kinetics of oxidation in 50 cycles, each cycle consisting of heating and cooling. X-ray diffraction and SEM/EDAX techniques are used to characterize the oxide scale formed. Coated alloys showed a lower corrosion rate as compared to uncoated alloys. The coatings subjected to oxidation and hot corrosion showed slow scale growth kinetics. Preferential oxidation of Co, Cr, W and its spinel blocks the transport of oxygen and corrosive species into the coating by providing a barrier, thereby making the oxidation rate to reach steady state. As compared to the substrate alloys, coatings show better hot corrosion resistance.

TI Sintering of WC hardmetals with Ni-Co-Cr-Ti-Al multi-component alloys
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REFRACTORY METALS & HARD MATERIALS
AB Cemented carbides with Ni-Co-Cr-Al-W binder phases have been obtained from WC-Ni-Co-Cr3C2-TiAl3 powder mixtures by using standard hardmetal processing routes. Dilatometric and DSC experiments confirm that melting events and shrinkage in these materials are shifted towards higher temperatures as the Al content increases. It is also shown that sintering in Argon is enhanced at very low Al levels (0.63 wt%), which is likely due to the efficient reduction of powder oxides via direct reaction with TiAl3. For higher Al additions, HIP treatments are needed in order to remove the residual porosity left after vacuum sintering. Microstructural characterization confirms that Al additions induce two types of precipitation phenomena in the metallic binder phase of these hardmetals: one consisting of very fine Al-rich oxides (product of the aforementioned powder oxide reduction) and the other comprising even finer gamma' type cuboids (similar to those found in Ni superalloys). As confirmed by TEM-EDS analyses, the binder phase of these cemented carbides is a multicomponent alloy incluiding Co, Ni, Cr, W and increasing amounts of Al as TiAl3 addition increases. About 0.5 wt% Al is lost to the powder oxides reduction process. TiAl3 additions have a significant hardening effect on WC-Ni-Co-Cr3C2 alloys. This is due to its effective role as WC grain growth inhibitor. Although, solution-aging treatments induce a finer and more homogeneous precipitation of the gamma' phase in these materials, their hardness is slighlty reduced if compared to that of as-HIPed samples.

TI Oxidation Behavior of Modified Low Thermal Expansion Thermo-Span
   Superalloy at 650 degrees C
SO RARE METAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING
AB Modified Thermo-Span superalloys of low thermal expansion have high comprehensive tensile and low thermal expansion coefficient. Compare to standard alloy, their Cr element content was decreased and Al element was increased. By means of thermogravimetry (TG), scanning electron microscopy equipped with electron probe (EPMA), the distribution of trace element B in Thermo-Span alloy and its influence on oxidation behavior at 650 degrees C for 100 h have been investigated. The results show that B element in modified Thermo-Span alloy can accelerate precipitation on grain boundaries, and boride precipitation in grain boundaries. The oxidization behavior follows the parabolic curve rule. During the oxidation process, Fe and Co diffuse from the matrix to the outside oxidation layer, and Al, Cr and Ti diffuse from the transition layer towards the matrix. Fe, Co and 0 elements enrich on surface oxidation layer, which forms oxides of Fe and Co, and oxides of Fe in standard alloy. At the same time, Al and Cr are leaning to enrich in the layer between the surface layer and matrix, and there is no Fe and Co element in this middle layer. Boride resists the diffusion of iron from the matrix to the oxidation layer, decreasing the Fe element diffuses outside, the surface oxides of Fe decreasing, and forming the oxides of Fe and Co, hence decreasing the oxide rate of modification Thermo-Span alloy at 650 degrees C for 100 h, and increasing its oxidation resistance.

TI Co-deposition of Ir-containing Zr coating by double glow plasma
SO ACTA ASTRONAUTICA
AB Ir-Zr co-deposition coatings with 71 at% Zr were deposited on graphite by double glow plasma at 1073-1123 K. The structure and composition of the coatings were confirmed by FE-SEM, XRD, XPS and EDS. The hardness and the elastic modulus of the coatings were estimated by nanoindentation instrument. The adhesion strength between the coating and the substrate was evaluated by a scratch tester. The results showed that the coating was composed of nanocrystalline grains with a size of 80-90 nm compared with 0.5 mu m for the pure It coating. The fine grains of the coatings might be attributed to the additional Zr element. New phases IrZr and ZrC were formed due to the high content of Zr and high deposition temperature. The hardness and elastic modulus of the coatings were about 7.5 GPa and 388 GPa, respectively. The adhesive force between the coating and the substrate was about 10 N. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Characteristic of temperature change in co-deposition of Al and Fe on
   copper by pack cementation
SO THERMOCHIMICA ACTA
AB An experimental apparatus was set up to simulate co-deposition of Al and Fe on copper by pack cementation. The thermal history in the coating processes has been measured by K-type thermocouples. The effect of the pack mixture, holding temperature and heating rate on the temperature change on a copper surface were examined. The experimental results showed that a high Al and Fe mass fraction in pack mixture causes an obvious temperature fluctuation while the NH4Cl mass fraction and the Al2O3 mass fraction only slightly affect the temperature change. Two distinct jumps in the temperature of the sample occurred for all the experimental runs, which are strongly affected by the holding temperature. The heating rate of the pack mixture has a significant effect on the temperature change of the substrate surface. High heating rates cause an unsteady temperature change on the substrate surface.

In addition to the high temperatures, the facility properly simulates all the erosion parameters which were determined to be important from the aerodynamics point of view. These parameters include particle velocity, angle of impact, particle size, particle concentration and sample size. For a better understanding of the use of this tunnel and to obtain good results, definitions of the parameters used in the wind tunnel testings and test procedures are presented: for example, an experimental study which was conducted to investigate the erosion behavior of titanium carbide coating exposed to fly ash and chromite particles. The chemical vapor deposition technique (CVD) was used to apply a ceramic coating on nickel and cobalt based superalloys (M246 and X40). The test specimens were exposed to particle laden flow at velocities of 305 and 366 m s(-1) and temperatures of 550 degrees C and 815 degrees C.

TI Laser-assisted processing of Ni-Al-Co-Ti under high pressure
SO MATERIALS AND MANUFACTURING PROCESSES
AB Laser-assisted processing and in-situ characterization of a Ni-0.7-Al-0.1235-Co-0.15-Ti-0.0265 alloy were carried out under a range of simultaneous hydrostatic high pressures of similar to 30GPa and high temperature conditions similar to 2000 degrees C using a laser-assisted heating in diamond anvil cell with synchrotron X-ray micro-diffraction. The characterization of the microstructure and X-ray diffraction analysis at ambient conditions confirmed the formation of the cuboids of ordered phase in the disordered matrix. The isothermal bulk modulus (B-0) and its first-order derivative (B-0') of the alloy were determined to be B-0 = 123 +/- 9 GPa and B-0' = 5.7 +/- 2.8. The in-situ characterization of the alloy at high temperatures under high pressures revealed that the phase transforms into the tetragonaly distorted D0(22)-type structure. This transformation is similar to the transformation that occurs in the ordered Ni3Al, responsible for the improved strength at high temperatures. High pressure was found to increase the onset temperature of the structural distortion. The pressure-temperature phase diagram of the Ni-0.7-Al-0.1235-Co-0.15-Ti-0.0265 up to similar to 30GPa and similar to 2000 degrees C was determined and is reported here.

TI Effects of test conditions on the tribological behaviour of a journal
   bearing in molten zinc
SO WEAR
AB Wear of journal bearings, consisting of cobalt-based Tribaloy T-800 bushings and carbide-coated 316L stainless steel (316L SS) sleeves, was evaluated in a molten zinc-aluminum alloy at different speeds and loads. It was found that these bearings experienced much less wear in comparison with the commonly used Stellite 6 bearings under similar conditions. There appeared to be a threshold load level of about 6.7 kN, below which both the friction and wear of the bearings were low. With the load maintained at a constant level, an increase in the test speed resulted in lower friction and lesser wear. The worn surfaces of both bushings and sleeves were relatively smooth without the appearance of wear grooves. Thorough analyses of the tested samples revealed that both materials have a lesser tendency to react with molten zinc. The binder phases of the carbide coating, however, did react with the test bath. Cracking of the test materials near the contact surfaces indicated that surface fatigue wear was the major wear mechanism affecting the journal bearing sliding in molten zinc. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES

AB Energy consideration is made to discuss the spherical to cubical shape transitions of coherent precipitates in cubic materials. A superspherical shape approximation is adopted to describe intermediate shapes of the precipitates between a sphere and a cube. The elastic strain energy due to the misfit precipitates is evaluated by solving three-dimensional inclusion problems of cubic materials for superspherical inclusions with uniform eigenstrains. One of the advantages of the present analysis is that the shape transitions of the precipitates from spherical to cubical can be discussed with simple analysis using a parameter describing the cubic character of precipitates. The present theoretical results well explain the previous experimental results on the shape transitions of precipitates for Ni-Ni3Al and Cu-Co-Cr alloys. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Additive manufacturing (AM) via the direct metal laser sintering (DMLS) route is a new technology for both new make and repair application in gas turbine hot gas path components. This paper presents the development of a new oxidation coating Ceral 10 as a protective coating on the AM CoCrMo alloys. A high Al activity slurry aluminide coating (Ceral 10) was deposited on the DMLS CoCrMo. The coating produced on DMLS CoCrMo was uniform and intact having a thickness of similar to 80-100 mu m. The slurry aluminide coating showed an Inward diffusion with the DMLS CoCrMo substrate having an Al of 38-40 wt% and Si (12-13 wt%) after the diffusion heat treatment. The interface with the substrate was gradual in terms of chemistry with an interdiffusion zone of 15-20 mu m. The Ceral 10 coating showed limited oxidation up to 1038 degrees C (1000 h) and at 1066 degrees C (after 500 h), coating spallation occurred. The distinct thermally grown oxide between the coating-substrate interface led to the spallation. The effectiveness of the Ceral 10 coating to protect the DMLS CoCrMo alloy at high temperatures is evaluated via detailed microstructural characterization.

   under the service in the presence of corrosive gases
SO ENGINEERING FAILURE ANALYSIS
AB We have performed a failure analysis on a monel packing material subjected to sulfidation and sulfide stress cracking after a short period of service in an atmospheric distillation tower containing corrosive gases. Optical macroscopic inspections show that the failed packing material was basically covered with dark scales and corrosion products. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction spectrum show that the corrosion products contain sulfur as the main element along with oxygen indicating that oxidation may have been taken place beside sulfidation. Metallography of the failed samples reveals that cracks exist and were initiated on the surface from defects most likely developed due to the formation of porous and brittle sulfide layer accomplished by hydrogen embrittlement. Although nickel base alloys are an appropriate candidate owing to their high corrosion resistant in corrosive atmospheres, however, presence of H2S, HCl, O-2 and naphthenic acid in crude oil lead to reduction in corrosion resistant of the monel 400 alloy.

In this study, Cr3C2-NiCr, NiCrBSi, Stellite-6 and Ni-20Cr coatings were deposited on a Ni-based superalloy (19.5Cr-3Fe-0.3Ti-0.1C-balance Ni) using an HVOF process. Hot corrosion studies were performed on bare as well as coated superalloy specimens after exposure to a molten salt environment at 900 degrees C under cyclic conditions. The thermogravimetric technique was used to establish the kinetics of corrosion. XRD, SEM/EDAX and EPMA techniques were used to analyse the corrosion products. The hot corrosion resistance of all the coatings were superior to bare superalloy. Among the coatings studied, the Ni-20Cr coated superalloy imparted maximum hot corrosion resistance, whereas the Stellite-6 coated indicated minimum resistance. The hot corrosion resistance of all coatings may be attributed to the formation of oxides and spinels of nickel,,chromium or cobalt. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Direct materials deposition: designed macro and microstructure
SO MATERIALS RESEARCH INNOVATIONS
AB Solid freeform fabrication of engineering materials is now possible using the Direct Metal Deposition (DMD) technique. Closed loop optical feedback system for DMD makes realistic components with dimensional accuracy of 0.01 inch. On the other hand, close control of the process parameter can provide microstructure of choice. Such continued capability to control macro and microstructure is creating considerable interest. H13 tool steel is one of the difficult alloys for deposition due to residual stress accumulation from martensitic transformation. However, it is the material of choice for the die and tool industry. DMD offers Copper chill blocks and water cooling channels as the integral part of the tool. On the other hand ZrO(2) was co-deposited with nickel superalloys using DMD. This process thus is amenable to produce both macro and microstructure to a designed specification. This paper briefly reviews the state of the art of DMD and describes the microstructure and mechanical properties of selected engineering alloy systems deposited by DMD.

   oxidation behavior at 1100 degrees C with a NiCrAlY coating
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB A microcrystalline beta-NiAl coating was prepared on a single-crystal (SC) superalloy substrate via magnetron sputtering and subsequent vacuum annealing. The grain sizes of the coating ranged from about 300 nm to 1 mu m. A reference NiCrAlY coating, which was mainly comprised of gamma'-Ni3Al and alpha-Cr, was prepared by means of vacuum arc evaporation (VAE). Isothermal oxidation tests were carried out at 1100 degrees C in air for 50 h. Both coatings formed thin and adherent alpha-Al2O3 scales during tests, while the oxide scales on the bare superalloy primarily consisted of spinel (Ni,Co)Al2O4 with underlying alpha-Al2O3 scale. The parabolic rate constant of the NiAl-coated specimens was about one order of magnitude lower than that of the NiCrAlY coated specimens. After oxidation tests, only a small amount of gamma' phase was detected at some columnar boundaries of the beta-NiAl coating, and about 2/3 parts of the NiCrAlY coating transformed into gamma phase which resolved the alpha-Cr precipitations, while an Al-depleted zone in thickness of about 10 mu m formed beneath the TGO of the bare superalloy. Inter-diffusion zones and secondary reaction zones were observed on the specimens coated by either beta-NiAl or NiCrAlY. The oxidation mechanism and microstructure evolvement of the specimens during high temperature exposures were discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Mapping Chemical Selection Pathways for Designing Multicomponent Alloys:
   an informatics framework for materials design
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB A data driven methodology is developed for tracking the collective influence of the multiple attributes of alloying elements on both thermodynamic and mechanical properties of metal alloys. Cobalt-based superalloys are used as a template to demonstrate the approach. By mapping the high dimensional nature of the systematics of elemental data embedded in the periodic table into the form of a network graph, one can guide targeted first principles calculations that identify the influence of specific elements on phase stability, crystal structure and elastic properties. This provides a fundamentally new means to rapidly identify new stable alloy chemistries with enhanced high temperature properties. The resulting visualization scheme exhibits the grouping and proximity of elements based on their impact on the properties of intermetallic alloys. Unlike the periodic table however, the distance between neighboring elements uncovers relationships in a complex high dimensional information space that would not have been easily seen otherwise. The predictions of the methodology are found to be consistent with reported experimental and theoretical studies. The informatics based methodology presented in this study can be generalized to a framework for data analysis and knowledge discovery that can be applied to many material systems and recreated for different design objectives.

TI Density and Molar Volume of Liquid Iron Containing Nb
SO STEEL RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL
AB Densities of liquid iron containing Nb up to 0.198wtpct were measured with the modified sessile drop method in a temperature range from 1510 to 1610 degrees C. The densities decrease linearly with increase in temperature and increase with increase in niobium content. The thermal expansion coefficient of molten liquid containing Nb increases linearly with increase in niobium content. An equation for density of liquid iron containing niobium has been derived from the measured results as a function of temperature and niobium content as follows: rho(103kgm-3)=7.03+0.75x[%Nb]-(7.54+6.92x[%Nb])x10-4(T-1530)1510 degrees CT1610 degrees C,Tin degrees C
   The difference between the measured and calculated values is in the range of -0.26 to +0.29pct. The molar volume of liquid iron containing Nb at the same temperature decreases with increase in niobium content. The partial molar volume of niobium in liquid iron decreases with increase in temperature, while that of iron increases with temperature. The densities calculated with the partial molar volumes are in good agreement with the measured ones for the iron-niobium binary alloys.

AB Nickel- and cobalt-based superalloys have been developed and are used in the hot sections of gas turbines in order to meet complex high-temperature phenomena. The gas temperature in modern engines exceeds 1650 degrees C in the turbine section and its cooled parts reach temperatures as high as 1200 degrees C. During operation, the structural materials degrade by fatigue, creep, oxidation, corrosion and erosive wear. Protective coatings provide barriers between the alloys and outer environment and, in particular, they enhance a resistance to oxidation and hot corrosion. The metallic coatings can be divided into two categories: diffusion and overlay coatings. Diffusion aluminide coatings (DAC) are based on the intermetallic compound beta-NiAl that forms under the influence of the substrate. Although DAC have been enjoying wide application, they have a limitation which arises from no deliberate changes of their properties to meet requirements of specific service conditions. This article is focused on a detection of damage that formed in the diffusion coatings on first stage turbine blades after two different short-term overheating events. Motivation for this study came from demands for an extension of our knowledge of degradation mechanisms. A possibility of a non-destructive assessment of the damage level using suitable damage parameters is also briefly described.

TI First principles calculations of alloying element diffusion coefficients
   in Ni using the five-frequency model
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB The diffusion coefficients of several alloying elements (Al, Mo, Co, Ta, Ru, W, Cr, Re) in Ni are directly calculated using the five-frequency model and the first principles density functional theory. The correlation factors provided by the five-frequency model are explicitly calculated. The calculated diffusion coefficients show their excellent agreement with the available experimental data. Both the diffusion pre-factor (D-0) and the activation energy (Q) of impurity diffusion are obtained. The diffusion coefficients above 700 K are sorted in the following order: D-Al > D-Cr > D-Co > D-Ta > D-Mo > D-Ru > D-W > D-Re. It is found that there is a positive correlation between the atomic radius of the solute and the jump energy of Ni that results in the rotation of the solute-vacancy pair (E-1). The value of E-2-E-1 (E-2 is the solute diffusion energy) and the correlation factor each also show a positive correlation. The larger atoms in the same series have lower diffusion activation energies and faster diffusion coefficients.

TI Dependence on the Chromium Content of the High-Temperature Oxidation
   Behavior of Ta-Rich Nickel-Based Cast Alloys
SO OXIDATION OF METALS
AB The high-temperature stability of primary tantalum carbides is a problem of importance for chromium-rich cast alloys, based on cobalt or nickel. The focus of this study was nickel-based alloys, as these alloys are particularly sensitive to a lack of TaC in the as-cast state and by dissolution due to high-temperature exposure. In this work, a possible way for promoting the formation of many TaC precipitates by changing from the usual 30 wt% chromium content was investigated. Five alloys with Cr content varying from 10 to 50 wt% were prepared and then subjected to microstructure characterization and to oxidation tests. In contrast with what was expected, decreasing the Cr content in comparison with the Ni-30Cr-0.4C-6Ta reference alloy did not succeed in obtaining more TaC precipitates, but instead had the opposite effect. Concerning the high-temperature oxidation behavior at 1127 and 1237 A degrees C, loss of resistance was observed only for a Cr content at the lower level of 10 wt%. It was noticed that a subscale CrTaO4 developed during oxidation and seemed to promote oxide spallation during cooling.

AB The oxidation behavior of HVOF sprayed Cr3C2-NiCr coatings on 310S stainless steel for 50 cycles in air at 700 degrees C under cyclic conditions has been investigated in the present work. The microstructure, hardness and porosity of the coating were characterised. X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscope with energy dispersive spectroscopy and X-ray mapping were used to analyze the scales formed on the surface of the oxidised samples. The microstructure of the as sprayed coating showed uniformly distributed chrome carbide-rich ceramic grains attached with nickel chrome-rich binder phase. The Cr3C2-25% NiCr coated specimen exihibit negligible microspalling of the scales upon oxidation. The improved oxidation resistance of Cr3C2-NiCr coatings may be attributed to the formation of oxides of chromium, nickel, and spinels of nickel and chromium.

TI Leaching kinetics, separation, and recovery of rhenium and component
   metals from CMSX-4 superalloys using hydrometallurgical processes
SO SEPARATION AND PURIFICATION TECHNOLOGY
AB A study to leach and recycle rhenium from CMSX-4, a second generation ultrahigh-strength single crystal nickel-based superalloy, containing 3% rhenium is presented. Experimental factors involved in the leaching process of rhenium from CMSX-4 using aqua-regia solution have been investigated and reported. Experimental factors such as concentration of aqua-regia, the use of sonication, leaching period, solid-to-liquid ratio and stirring speed have been optimised and the leaching kinetics of rhenium and other component metals of superalloy CMSX-4 have been studied. Increasing aqua-regia concentration to 100% (v/v) resulted in more than 30% gain in recovery which can be attributed to the increased availability of leaching reagents. The leaching kinetics of rhenium from superalloy CMSX-4 in 100% aqua-regia solution fit into a chemical reaction controlled kinetics model for the first period of leaching. For the leaching period after 480 min, the leaching kinetics of rhenium fits a diffusion through the product layer model. Application of ultrasonic waves to the leaching process has proven useful to slightly increase yield. Given the small increase, however, sonication may not be economically feasible for recovery of rhenium on an industrial scale. Precipitation of other metals away from the rhenium rich solution has also been explored to prepare the solution for a downstream rhenium recovery process. It was found that that two unique precipitates can be recovered from the solution. The first precipitate, recovered at pH 5.05, has been determined to be mainly composed of the oxides of aluminium, chromium, molybdenum, and titanium. A green precipitate of mixed hydroxides of cobalt and nickel (MHP) which has commercial value can then be recovered at pH 7.0 leaving a rhenium enriched solution for further processing.

AB The deposition of high wear- and corrosion-resistant alloys through Plasma Transferred Arc (PTA) is an easily automated process combining the possibility to obtain very thick coatings with high deposition speeds, low thermal distortion of the part and negligible dilution levels, thanks to a very high energy-concentration [S. Kalpakjian, S.R. Schmid, Manufacturing Engineering and Technology-4th edition, Addison-Wesley Publishing, 2001, p. 789-790, Scripta Materialia 37 (1997) 721, Applied Surface Science 201 (2002) 154, Surface and Coatings Technology 71 (1995) 196, Journal of Materials Processing Technology 128 (2002) 169, M.

Literature studies regard mostly wear or high temperature behaviour of the deposited alloys and plasma hardening treatment without powder [Applied Surface Science 201 (2002) 154, Surface and Coatings Technology 71 (1995) 196, Journal of Materials Processing Technology 128 (2002) 169, M.

An experimental campaign has been carried out on the deposition of two nickel- and a cobalt-base superalloys: Hastelloy 276, Inconel 625 and Stellite 6. Benchmarks of C-Mn steel have been chosen to test geometrical configurations that are critical for the application (corners and grooves). Specimen characterisation through liquid penetration inspection, optical- and scanning electron microscopy and microhardness tests proved that process parameters optimisation depends only on the geometrical configuration and not on the deposited alloy. This result suggests the importance of an accurate design of the reciprocal positioning and movement between the torch and the part to be coated, as a function of the deposition geometry.

TI Bubble Nucleation During Oxidation of SiC
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CERAMIC SOCIETY
AB Oxidation of SiC at 1400 degrees C-1700 degrees C produces carbon monoxide (CO), which can form bubbles at the interface between the substrate and the silica (SiO2) overgrowth. The bubbles add complexity to the mechanistic understanding of the oxidation process. We analyze the kinetics of bubble formation, where the driving force for their nucleation depends on the partial pressure of CO while their growth is determined by the viscosity of silica. The mechanism bears analogy to oxygen migrating from the atmosphere into superalloys, and reacting with carbide precipitates at the grain boundaries to nucleate bubbles of carbon monoxide, or hydrogen migrating into carbon-steel to form methane. The unique feature of the present case is the ability of silica to release the gas pressure within the bubbles by viscous flow, and then, to heal the crater that is left behind. As the bubbles grow out from the interface and escape into the atmosphere, they can expose bare surface to the atmosphere rendering silicon carbide vulnerable to active oxidation. The relative significance of the mechanisms of oxidation of SiC is presented in the form of an oxidation map, where atmospheric pO2 and oxidation temperature are the experimental variables. We discover that experiments often lie in the regime of bubble formation.

   MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Prototypical single-crystal NiAlCrX superalloys were studied to examine the effects of the common major alloying elements, Co, Mo, Nb, Ta, Ti, and W, on yielding behavior. The alloys contained about 10 at. pct Cr, 60 vol pet of the gamma' phase, and about 3 at. pct of X in the gamma'. The critical resolved shear stresses (CRSSs) for octahedral and primary cube slip were measured at 760 degrees C, which is about the peak strength temperature. The CRSSoct and CRSScube are discussed in relation to thoseof Ni-3 (Al, X) gamma' alloys taken from the literature and the gamma'/gamma lattice mismatch. The CRSSoct ofthe gamma + gamma' alloys reflected a similar compositional dependence to that of both the CRSScube of the gamma' phase and the gamma/gamma' lattice parameter mismatch. The CRSScube of the gamma + gamma' alloys also reflected the compositional dependence of the gamma'/gamma mismatch, but bore no similarity to that of CRSScube for gamma' alloys since it is controlled by the gamma matrix. The ratio of CRSScube/CRSSoct was decreased by all alloying elements except Co, which increased the ratio. The decrease in CRSScube/CRSSoct was related to the degree in which elements partition to ehe gamma' rather than the gamma phase.

CY JUN 25-29, 2007
CL Noordwijk, NETHERLANDS
AB The effects of platinum (Pt) layer on phase transformation and oxidation behavior of MCrAlY (M = Co, Ni) coatings were investigated by isothermal and cyclic oxidation tests at temperature of 1100 degrees C. Pt layer of about 5 mu m thickness was deposited on MAR M247-DS superalloy byan electroplating method, and then the MCrAlY layers were coated with air plasma spray (APS) and vacuum plasma spray (VPS) methods. APS process creates internal oxides and interface voids, whereas the VPS process shows fewer voids in the interface between the MCrAlY layer and the superalloy used as substrate. The oxides and voids formed in the APS process deteriorate the oxidation resistance, indicating that the oxides and voids are transferred to Al2O3 compounds during the oxidation tests. The Pt layer shows a strong affinity with Ni element and a weak affinity with Co and Cr elements, resulting in the formation of beta-(Ni,Pt)Al phase. The Pt pre-coated layer forces down for the diffusion of soluble elements to get the reduced deplete zone in the superalloy. The VPS process enhances the oxidation resistance of the MCrAlY coating and shows better bonding strength, owing to the generation of homogenous microstructure in the coating and less processing defects.

AB Inertia welding is a common practice to join axially symmetrical parts for aero-engine applications. The shaft for a new advanced high-pressure compressor will be produced by joining the high strength superalloys INCOLOY (R) alloy 909 (Incoloy909) and INCONEL (R) alloy 718 (IN718). IN718 is the work-horse nickel-iron-chromium alloy for a variety of parts for aero-engine applications due to a good combination of relevant mechanical properties, good corrosion resistance and easy fabricability. Incoloy909 is a nickel-iron-cobalt alloy used in aero-engines due to an interesting combination of a nearly constant low coefficient of thermal expansion combined with a constant modulus of elasticity and high strength over a wide range of temperatures. Both alloys are strengthened by precipitation-hardening through additions of niobium and titanium. Ring shaped specimens of fully heat-treated Incoloy909 and IN718 are joined by inertia welding. The microstructure in the welded zone is investigated by optical microscopy and transmission electron microscopy with the focus on the Incoloy909 side. Post-weld heat-treatments (PWHT) are evaluated by microstructural investigations and by hardness measurements. The chosen PWHT is characterized by its tensile, creep and load controlled fatigue properties. The results of the mechanical tests are described in terms of the microstructural changes observed in the welded zone.

SO JOURNAL OF THERMAL SPRAY TECHNOLOGY
AB No alloy is immune to hot corrosion attack indefinitely. Coatings can extend the lives of substrate materials used at higher temperatures in corrosive environments by forming protective oxides layers that are reasonably effective for long-term applications. This article is concerned with studying the performance of high-velocity oxyfuel (HVOF) sprayed NiCrBSi, Cr3C2-NiCr, Ni-20Cr, and Stellite-6 coatings on a nickel-base superalloy at 900 degrees C in the molten salt (Na2SO4-60%V2O5) environment under cyclic oxidation conditions. The thermogravimetric technique was used to establish kinetics of corrosion. Optical microscope, x-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy/electron dispersive analysis by x-ray (SEM/EDAX), and electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) techniques were used to characterize the as-sprayed coatings and corrosion products. The bare superalloy suffered somewhat accelerated corrosion in the given environmental conditions, whereas hot corrosion resistance of all the coated superalloys was found to be better. Among the coatings studied, Ni-20Cr coated superalloy imparted maximum hot corrosion resistance, whereas Stellite-6 coated indicated minimum resistance. The hot corrosion resistance of all the coatings may be attributed to the formation of oxides and spinels of nickel, chromium, or cobalt.

TI A comparative study of plasma sprayed coatings on railway brake discs
SO SURFACE ENGINEERING
AB In the railway context, increasing the number of trains in service relies in the development of new equipment. This objective requires increased peak speeds at the expense of stronger motorisations. The axle loads are thus heavier, especially for the new double-decker trains. These parameters have significant effects on the brake system in terms of size, non-suspended masses, and therefore energies to be dissipated. The constituent materials of the friction brakes of some railway equipment (full non-ventilated steel alloy discs for the TGV, for example) hav thus reached their technological limits in terms of energy to be dissipated for fixed mass and size. It is therefore necessary to find more powerful braking designs using new materials. The Laboratoire d'Automatique et de Mechanique Industrielles et Humaines (LAMIH) has therefore decided to focus its research toward high energy full discs. This approach consists of coating the steel discs with low thermal diffusivity friction materials that have very strong and stable mechanical and tribological characteristics at high temperature. Using blown thermal plasma, the LAMIH has already tested reduced scale C38 discs coated with NiCr-Cr3C2 cermet facing an Al2TiO5 pad. Henceforth, studies relate to cobalt or nickel based superalloys obtained by the transferred plasma process with a view to making a reliable coating-substrate bond. Performance is evaluated in terms of friction factor, wear, contact temperature, and reliability.

TI Microstructure and Mechanical Performance of the DD98M-DD98M Single
   Crystal Superalloy Joints Brazed Using a Pd-Si Composite Filler
SO METALS
AB In this work, the DD98M single crystal superalloys were brazed to themselves using a Pd-Si composite filler. The effect of brazing temperature and soaking time on the microstructure and mechanical behavior of the joints was studied. The microstructure and phase constitution in the joint were identified by the SEM and EDS analysis. The results indicated that the joint obtained was constituted by DD98M/zone 2/zone 1/zone 2/DD98M. The zone 1 was primarily made up of the Ni (Pd, Cr, Co) (s.s), Pd4Si, Pd (Ni, Ti, Al) (s.s) and Pd-rich Ni (Pd, Cr, Co) (s.s), while the zone 2 consisted of the Ni (Pd, Cr, Co) (s.s) and Al2Pd5. During the brazing process, increasing the brazing temperature strengthened the fluidity of the liquid filler, which was favorable to eliminating the solidified pores in the brazing seam. Furthermore, a higher brazing temperature would cause the phases in the zones 1 and 2 to be coarsened remarkably. When setting the brazing temperature to 1060 degrees C, extending the soaking time made the amount of Pd (Ni, Ti, Al) (s.s) decrease, whereas the amount of Pd4Si increased, because the peritectic reaction between the Pd (Ni, Ti, Al) (s.s) and remnant liquid filler was enhanced. Among the brazing process parameters under investigation, the maximum joint average shear strength obtained reached 338 MPa when the joint was brazed at 1060 degrees C for 30 min. A ductile fracture mode happened during the shear tests under a joining condition. The work performed can provide valuable data to design the single crystal superalloy brazed joint.

TI OPTIMIZATION OF THE MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF THE SUPERALLOY NIMONIC 80A
SO MATERIALI IN TEHNOLOGIJE
AB The superalloy Nimonic 80A has found its major application in the production of the parts for the vehicle and airplane industries. It is a relatively expensive material and it is very important to reduce its production costs to acceptable levels. The aim of this research was to produce the superalloys with varying supplements of alloying elements.
   The investigations carried out included chemical testing and the testing of the mechanical properties of the superalloy Nimonic 80A, followed by a regression analysis of the obtained data to show the influence of certain alloying elements that can significantly affect the improvement of the mechanical properties of Nimonic 80A.
   The results of the regression analysis are the equations with which, on the basis of the known chemical composition, i.e., the content of the main alloying elements - Al, Ti and Co - the mechanical properties of the materials at increased temperatures can be predicted. On the basis of the obtained squared regression equations, an optimization of the chemical composition for the selected values of the mechanical properties was carried out.

TI Metal dusting and coking of alloy 803
SO CORROSION SCIENCE
AB Investigation was made by SEM examination on metal dusting and coking behaviours of alloy 803 in a flowing gas mixture of H-2-CO-H2O, It was found that an oxide scale arisen on the sample surface at the beginning of exposure, Metal dusting started when graphite deposition occurred earlier at the local defects in the oxide settle than the defects were repaired by enough supply of chromium from the interior of alloy matrix. Coke consisted of graphite filaments and metallic particles produced by disintegrating of alloy matrix, and grow up from the defects in the oxide scale with pit left in the sample surface, Increasing chromium content, doping a small amount of silicon and reducing grain size to create fast diffusion paths for chromium and silicon to alloy surface, all promote the formation of a dense oxide scale and favor early self-repairing or the defects in the oxide scale before occurrence of graphite deposition, The resistance of an alloy to metal dusting can be improved generally by means of these methods, (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

TI HIGH TEMPERATURE OXIDATION BEHAVIOUR OF CoCrTaAlY+10%Al2O3 COATINGS
   PRODUCED BY HVOF
SO METALLURGIA ITALIANA
AB High temperature oxidation causes degradation of materials in aircraft engines. Typical coatings like MCrAlY (where M is Co, Ni or Fe) are used to prevent or retard oxidation. High Velocity Oxygen Fuel (HVOF) is a thermal spray technique used in this field.
   This work aims to characterize a reinforced CoCrTaAlY (+10% Al2O3) coating that has been thermally sprayed on CMSX-4 superalloy discs by HVOF. The samples were exposed at 1100 degrees C for long times (100-500 h) in air to develop oxidation. Interdiffusion processes were activated at high temperatures and microhardness values decreased as a function of time and distance from the surface. After 500h oxidation, hardness values in the coating were comparable to that in the matrix, with a 25% reduction compared to the pre-oxidized condition. At the same time, a strong aluminum oxide developed on the surface to protect the coating; the oxide was 5 pm thick after 96 h and higher than 12 pm after 50Ch. microstructure characterization was performed by light microscopy and SEM.

SO MATERIALWISSENSCHAFT UND WERKSTOFFTECHNIK
AB The present paper presents a novel approach which allows a direct assessment of the creep strength of thin walled DS turbine blades at temperatures up to 1100 degrees C using a grain morphology sensitive miniature creep specimen test technique. The work builds up on earlier investigations by DeMestral and co-workers ([i] B. DeMestral et al., Met. and Mat. Transactions A, 27A (1996) pp. 879-890 and [ii] B. DeMestral and G. Eggeler, Prakt. Metallogr., 29 (1992) pp. 174-191) on the influence of grain morphology on creep deformation and damage accumulation in superalloys with elongated macrograins. The paper reports the important features of this new procedure which include (i) the creep test technique (specimen geometry and grip design) and (ii) the removal of creep specimens from a DS CM 247 LC cast blade with respect to the morphology of the macrograins. The paper also reports creep results obtained with this new technique at temperature of 1030 degrees C and a tensile stress of 180 MPa and discusses the results on the basis of the associated microstructural creep deformation and damage mechanisms.

AB The resistance to stress-accelerated grain boundary oxygen embrittlement (SAGBO) in Fe-Ni-Co-Nb-Ti controlled low expansion superalloy has been improved by trace yttrium element addition. The platelet precipitates in the alloy have been studied by means of optical microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, convergent beam electron microscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction technique. The crystal structure and the chemical composition of the platelet phase have been determined. The phase has a CaCu5-type crystal structure (space group P6/mmm) with lattice parameters a = 0.498 nm and c = 0.408 nm. The crystallographic orientation relationship between the phase and the matrix is found to be (<(11)over bar>1)(gamma)/(0001)(H), [(1) over bar 10](gamma)/[11 (2) over bar 0](H). High-resolution images show that the interface between the platelet phase and the matrix is semicoherent and some stacking faults have been found in the platelet phase. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science S.A.

AB A common method of protecting superalloys from aggressive environments at high temperatures is by plasma spraying MCrAlY (M = Fe, Ni and/or Co) to form an overlay coating. Oxidation resistance is then conferred through the development of an alumina layer. However, the use of such coatings is limited at temperatures above about 1100 degrees C due to rapid failure of the protective oxide scales. In this study, the oxidation behaviour of air-plasma-sprayed NiCrAlY coatings has been investigated at 1200 degrees C in 1 atm air. A protective alumina layer develops during the early stages, but breakaway oxidation occurs after prolonged exposure. The results suggest that the critical temperature drop to initiate failure is inversely proportional to the scale thickness, and an analytical model is put forward to explain this behaviour. Local surface curvature of the coating can lead to delamination within the oxide during cooling and it is shown that the largest individual pore in a spall region is the critical flaw for oxide fracture.

TI The effect of alloying elements on the dislocation climbing velocity in
   Ni: A first-principles study
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB By using density functional theory calculations in conjunction with the climbing images nudged elastic band method, the effects of alloying elements Re, W, Mo, Cr, Co and Ru on the velocity of dislocation climbing in gamma Ni were studied. The results shed a light on the mechanism of these elements suppressing the dislocation motion by connecting the stacking fault energy and the migration activation energy of vacancy with the dislocation climbing velocity. It is found that the elements can decrease the stacking fault energy of Ni and raise the migration activation energy of vacancy. The changes of these two energies result in the increase of the formation energy and the diffusion activation energy of the jog, thus the dislocation climbing is restricted. The results also reveal that the influences of alloying elements on dislocation climbing velocity depend on the characters of dislocations.

   crystals
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB Microstructure-sensitive creep models have been developed for Ni-base superalloy single crystals. Creep rupture testing was conducted on fourteen single crystal alloys at two applied stress levels at each of two temperatures, 982 and 1093 degrees C. The variation in creep lives among the different alloys could be explained with regression models containing relatively few microstructural parameters. At 982 degrees C, gamma-gamma' lattice mismatch, gamma' volume fraction, and initial gamma' size were statistically significant in explaining the creep rupture lives. At 1093 degrees C, only lattice mismatch and gamma' volume fraction were significant. These models could explain from 84% to 94% of the variation in creep lives, depending on test condition. Longer creep lives were associated with alloys having more negative lattice mismatch, lower gamma' volume fractions, and finer gamma' sizes. The gamma-gamma' lattice mismatch exhibited the strongest influence of all the microstructural parameters at both temperatures. Although a majority of the alloys in this study were stable with respect to topologically close packed (TCP) phases, it appeared that up to similar to 2 vol% TCP phase did not affect the 1093 degrees C creep lives under applied stresses that produced lives of similar to 200-300 h. In contrast, TCP phase contents of similar to 2 vol% were detrimental at lower applied stresses where creep lives were longer. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB INCONEL1 alloy 740 has been identified as a prime candidate for the severe operating conditions of USC boilers. It exhibits the highest stress rupture strength and corrosion resistance at projected operating temperatures approaching 760 degrees Centigrade. Alloy 740 is a precipitation-hardenable nickel-chromium-cobalt alloy with a niobium addition. In general, the issues of welding precipitation-hardenable alloys include heat-affected zone (HAZ) liquation cracking, ductility-dip cracking (DDC), and PWHT cracking. Alloy 740 is a new alloy with no fabrication history that was derived from NIMONIC (R)(1) alloy 263. The base chemistry of alloy 740 is different enough to require study of its weldability. This paper describes the weldability investigation now underway for this alloy. Tomorrow's USC boiler will require the use of thin section superalloys previously used in aerospace applications. Lessons learned from that industry are being applied and expanded to boiler applications up to three inches in thickness. The workscope of this project includes basic material characterization studies to determine cracking sensitivity relative to other well known aerospace alloys such as Waspalloy and INCONEL alloy 718. This information is being used in welding trials to determine acceptable welding processes and techniques which will result in sound thick section, crack free welds. Several weld processes were evaluated relative to welding the INCONEL alloy 740. Gas tungsten arc welding and pulsed Gas Metal Arc welding have emerged as the two most favorable processes.

AB Investment cast components are typically gravity-cast by induction melting and pouring molten alloy into a ceramic mold. Some of the more reactive alloys, such as the superalloys, are melted and cast under vacuum to reduce the formation of inclusions in the casting that can adversely affect their properties. Counter-gravity casting processes developed and patented by Hitchiner Manufacturing Co., Inc. Milford, NH utilize unique methods of melting and casting that fill the mold cavity from the bottom through a single-use ceramic fill pipe.
   Use of the fill pipe ensures that clean alloy enters the mold cavity by excluding the low density oxides that often float on top of the molten metal and are pushed to the walls of the melting crucible due to the eddy currents set up in the molten alloy. In addition, the rate at which the mold cavity is filled can be controlled in the counter-gravity casting processes, which enables casting of components with wall thickness as low as 375 mu m.
   This paper will describe the various counter-gravity casting processes that are currently in production. Results of chemical composition testing, mechanical properties and microstructure of some alloys cast using the various processes will be discussed.

SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB We develop a high-throughput calculation method that rigorously mines correlations embodied within experimental data and use it to direct quantum mechanical techniques efficiently toward the diffusion activation predictions and assessments. The new diffusion activation energies data of 298 binary systems, covering six faced-centered cubic (fcc) host metals of Group I (Cu, Ag, Au) and Group VIII (Fe, Co, Ni) and 76 elements of periods of 3, 4, 5 and 6, are predicted in this work. Furthermore, a new analytic expression, derived from data-mining, has been developed, which sheds light on the delicate relationship between diffusion activation energy and materials fundamental properties. The present approach can be extended to study the impurity diffusion in metal alloys of other complex structures where diffusion activation energies are difficult to obtain from first-principles calculation due to the complex diffusion mechanism. The present results could be used to provide useful data for other material simulation techniques such as CALPHAD or facilitate the choice of materials for technological applications.

AB The electrolytic reduction of a spent oxide fuel involves a liberation of the oxygen in a molten LiCl electrolyte, which is a chemically aggressive environment that is too corrosive for typical structural materials. So, it is essential to choose the optimum material for the process equipment for handling a molten salt. In this study, corrosion behaviors of Haynes 263, Inconel 718, Nimonic 80 A and Incoloy 800 H in a molten LiCl-Li2O salt under an oxidizing atmosphere were investigated at 650 C for 72-216 h. Haynes 263 alloy showed the highest corrosion resistance among the examined alloys. Corrosion products of Haynes 263 were Li(Ni,Co)O-2 and Li((Cr,Al)TiO4), and those of Inconel 718 were Cr2O3, NiFe2O4, and CrNbO4, while Cr2O3, LiFeO2, (Cr,Ti)(2)O-3, and Li2Ni8O10 were identified as the corrosion products of Nimonic 80 A. Incoloy 800 H showed Cr2O3 and FeCr2O4 as its corrosion products. Haynes 263 showed a localized corrosion behavior while Inconel 718, Nimonic 80 A and Incoloy 800 H showed a uniform corrosion behavior.

AB The microstructure of alloy 909, a low coefficient of thermal expansion Fe-Co-Ni superalloy was examined in the solution treated and over aged condition, following a previous communication by the authors on the solution treated and commercially aged alloys. In the commercially aged alloy, only the Laves and the gamma' phases were observed. With some indication, however, of alignment of the gamma' phase along crystallograpic directions in the austenitic matrix. This alignment of the gamma' phase has been previously reported as a precursor to the growth of the e phase from the gamma' phase. Analysis by TEM showed that the platelet phase was hexagonal (NiFeCo)(2)(TiNb) with some variations in the stoichiometry about 2: 1 ratio. Tensile and hardness testing indicated that the presence of the platelet shaped epsilon phase in the solution treated and overaged condition was not as effective in the strengthening of the alloys as the spherical gamma' in the commercially aged and solution treated condition. In addition to the presence of e phase, blocky A(2)B Laves phase was abundant, which prevents excessive grain growth up to similar to 1040 degrees C

TI Atomic and electronic basis for solutes strengthened (010) anti-phase
   boundary of L1(2) Co-3(Al, TM): A comprehensive first-principles study
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB The crystallographic and electronic structures of (010) APB of L1(2) Co3Al0.75TM0.25 are studied by high resolution transmission electron microscopy and first-principles calculations. Effects of solute atoms (TM = Cr, Hf, Mo, Ni, Re, Ru, Ta, Ti, W and Y) on the formation energy, lattice parameters/distortion, magnetism, and bonding strength of the (010) APB in Co3Al0.75TM0.25 are obtained from first-principles calculations. Comparing to the equilibrium volume of Co3Al, it is found that the volume change of the Co3Al0.75TM0.25 with and without the presence of APB increases linearly with the volume of the corresponding FCC elements, indicating the contribution of the solute atoms on lattice distortion of bulk and (010) APB. Particularly, the strong dependence of the APB energy on the composition is comprehensively discussed together with the available experimental and theoretical data in the literature. The negative (010) APB energy indicates that the formation of (010) APB could stabilize the ordered L1(2) (or the FCC lattice) Co3Al, and the local L1(2) -> D0(22) phase transformation can occur. The physical natures of lattice distortions caused by the fault layers of APB and the solute atoms are characterized by bonding charge density. It is found that the solute atoms, occupying Al site of L1(2) phase and its (010) APB, increase the local bonding strength along (010) through the electron redistribution during forming the chemical bonds with Co, revealing an intrinsic solid-solution strengthening mechanism. This work provides an insight into the atomic and electronic basis for solid-solution strengthening mechanism of L1(2) Co3Al0.75TM0.25. (C) 2017 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Recent advances in coal combustion have made coal a cleaner, more viable source for power generation. Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) plants pair conventional steam turbines and coal gas turbines. The overall efficiency of each system is largely dependent on the maximum operating temperature of the system, which is limited by the available materials. Superalloys have long been used as a turbine material due to their high temperature strength and general resistance to oxidation. Superalloy GTD-111 DS is currently being used as components in steam turbine engine such as turbine blades and discs and is now being introduced to the syngas environment, which consists of H-2, CO, CH4, and H2S in addition to H2O. H2S is highly corrosive and complicates the corrosion process. The high temperature corrosion behavior of a directionally solidified superalloy, GTD-111 DS has been studied using thermogravimtric analysis coupled with metallographic studies. Parabolic oxidation behavior was observed for test environments including dry and wet air. Simulated syngas environments show aggressive sulfidization that leads to massive sample damage. In the case of wet syngas environments, a protective oxide layer was observed which seem to increase the samples ability to resist further corrosion.

TI TEM study of the evolution of sputtered Ni plus CrAlYSiHfN nanocomposite
   coating with an AlN diffusion barrier at high temperature
SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB MCrAlY (M denotes Ni and/or Co) coatings are widely used on the turbine blades to protect the aeroengine at high temperature. However, the interdiffusion between coating/substrate and the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) mismatch between protective oxides layer/coating are the main factors that limit the service lifetime of MCrAlY coatings. In this work, a Ni+CrAlYSiHfN/AlN nanocomposite duplex coating system was designed to improve the weakness of conventional MCrAlY coatings. The nanocomposite coating system exhibited a low oxidation rate in the 1000 degrees C isothermal oxidation test and the oxidation rate constant of the coating system was 633 * 10(-13) g(2) cm(-4) s(-1) at the first 20 h, and then the TGO grew at a low constant of 1.49 * 10(-13) g(2) cm(-4) s(-1) until 200 h. Besides, the AlN diffusion barrier effectively inhibited the interdiffusion between coating/substrate. The evolution of coating microstructures and thermal growth oxides (TGO) at high temperature were studied with the aid of transmission electron microscopy. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Selection of optimum cutting condition of cobalt-based superalloy with
   GONNS
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY
AB Machining of new superalloys is challenging. Automated software environments for determining the optimal cutting conditions after reviewing a set of experimental results are very beneficial to obtain the desired surface quality and to use the machine tools effectively. The genetically optimized neural network system (GONNS) is proposed for the selection of optimal cutting conditions from the experimental data with minimal operator involvement. Genetic algorithm (GA) obtains the optimal operational condition by using the neural networks. A feed-forward backpropagation-type neural network was trained to represent the relationship between surface roughness, cutting force, and machining parameters of face-milling operation. Training data were collected at the symmetric and asymmetric milling operations by using different cutting speeds (V(c)), feed rates (f), and depth of cuts (a(p)) without using coolant. The surface roughness (Ra(asymt), Ra(symt)) and cutting force (Fx(asymt), Fy(asymt), Fz(asymt), Fx(symt), Fy(symt), Fz(symt)) were measured for each cutting condition. The surface roughness estimation accuracy of the neural network was better for the asymmetric milling operation with 0.4% and 5% for training and testing data, respectively. For the symmetric milling operations, slightly higher estimation errors were observed around 0.5% and 7% for the training and testing. One parameter was optimized by using the GONNS while all the other parameters, including the cutting forces and the surface roughness, were kept in the desired range.

TI Preparation of a Duplex Nanocrystalline Coating by Magnetron Sputtering
   and Its Oxidation Performance
SO JOURNAL OF NANOSCIENCE AND NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB A duplex nanocrystalline coating was prepared in this study by magnetron sputtering on N5 single-crystal super alloy (Ni: Bal, Co: 7.5, Cr: 7.0, Al: 6.2, Ta: 6.5, Re: 3.0, Mo: 1.5 and W: 5.0, wt%). The novel nanocrystalline coating consists of two layers, the inner layer having the same composition with the alloy substrate for avoiding elements inter diffusion while the outer layer has 7.6 wt% higher Al to quickly ensure the formation of a protective Al2O3 layer. Both two layers were deposited within one magnetron sputtering apparatus that contained two targets. The main target was having the same alloy substrate in composition and secondary target with pure Al. The difference in Al content between the two layers was achieved by controlling the secondary target during sputtering. This study revealed a way for preparing a series of similar coatings with varying compositions and improving performance. After oxidation at 1050 degrees C, a protective Al2O3 layer was quickly formed on the duplex nanocrystalline coating and no TCP phases were detected in the alloy substrate.

TI Structure and Phase Composition of Heat-Resistant Ni-Al-Co Alloy After
   Annealing and Creep
SO RUSSIAN PHYSICS JOURNAL
AB The paper presents research into the structure and phase composition of Ni-Al-Co alloy modified by rhenium (similar to 3 at.%) alloying. Observations are carried out using the transmission electron microscopy. The initial state of the alloy is the state after the directional crystallization. The alloy is further subjected to 900 degrees C annealing during 1143 h. Creep tests are additionally carried out for this alloy at the same temperature and time and 400 MPa load. It is shown that FCC disordered - and ordered -phases are major in all alloy states. Secondary phases are found to be sigma-phase, -phase, Laves and AlRe2 phases. Experiments show that the high temperature annealing changes the phase composition of the alloy. Thus, the amount of the ordered -phase increases, while that of disordered -phase decreases. During the creep process, the amount of the former reduces and the amount of the latter increases. The annealing process modifies the phase composition in secondary phases. It is found that the structural modification caused by the creep process differs from that caused by the annealing process. Thus, the creep-induced modification of the cuboid structure in -phase is stronger than due to annealing. Dislocations are observed in - and -phases in all states of the alloy. During the annealing process, the dislocation density in -phase is higher than in -phase, and vice versa during the creep process. The experiments show that the behavior of the dislocation structures is different during the annealing and creep processes.

SO METALLOGRAPHY MICROSTRUCTURE AND ANALYSIS
AB This research work was focused on the performance of HVOF-sprayed 83WC-17CO and 86WC-10CO-4Cr coatings on boiler steel alloys ASME SA213 T22 and ASME SA213 T91 in a coal-fired boiler environment. Both coated and bare steel alloys were subjected to cyclic exposures, in the superheater zone of a coal-fired boiler for 10 cycles at 900 A degrees C to compare the effect of the coatings in actual boiler environment. During the study, each cycle consisted of 100-h heating followed by 1-h cooling at ambient conditions and thereafter thermogravimetric method was used to establish the kinetics of corrosion. Corrosion products were examined by x-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive spectroscopy techniques. The hot corrosion resistance of both the coatings 83WC-17CO and 86WC-10CO-4Cr coating was found better on ASME SA213 T22, whereas 86WC-10CO-4Cr coating showed the higher corrosion resistance on ASME SA213 T22 as compared to 83WC-17CO coating.

TI Second Phase-Induced Degradation of Fused MgO Partially Stabilized
   Zirconia Aggregates
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CERAMIC SOCIETY
AB Magnesia-partially stabilized zirconia (Mg-PSZ) fired refractory crucibles used under vacuum induction melting (VIM) furnaces, are routinely cycled above 1500 degrees C in service, sometimes experiencing failure in under a dozen cycles. This has negative financial implications, given the high value Ni-Co superalloys melted in them. To evaluate aggregate response to cycling, the microstructural evolution of two commercial varieties of fused Mg-PSZ aggregate has been studied within their host refractories, over eight cycles to 1700 degrees C. The aggregates contain 0.1-0.2wt% alumina and silica impurities and at 1700 degrees C, these generate a liquid phase which on cooling, crystallizes segregated secondary phases of spinel, forsterite, and cordierite. These minerals have thermal expansion coefficients that are markedly different to zirconia and the mismatch in volume change rates between adjacent phases leads to aggregate breakdown. Micro-Raman mapping reveals internal boundaries within the aggregates which are attributed to retention of original surface concentrations of alumina and silica on zircon sand particles at the time of conversion into zirconia and which act as the main location for secondary phase development. Crucibles made with aggregates containing higher concentrations of stabilizer (>2wt% MgO) and MgO fines in their matrix phase, show significantly greater aggregate breakdown.

TI High temperature corrosion resistant coatings for gas turbine components
SO REVISTA DE METALURGIA
AB Hot section gas turbine components are made of superalloys, developed to withstand high temperatures in conditions in which mechanical stresses are high and that require high surface stability. However, during the 50s it became evident that compositions resulting in high mechanical strength for these materials were not compatible with those offering optimal protection from the working environments. The idea of employing protective coatings over materials with high mechanical strength resulted therefore from this situation. Presently, both aeronautic and power generation turbines operate at temperatures within the 900-1400 degrees C, thanks to these coatings, indispensable for their correct operation. In this work, the principal degradation mechanisms in these operating conditions and the different type of coatings presently employed by the industrial sector are described, beginning by the oldest Ni or Co aluminides, following with the addition of other metals such as Pt, Cr, etc. to the former coatings in order to increase their useful life, continuing with the overlay MCrAlY coatings and finishing with the thermal barrier coating systems. Moreover, the corresponding deposition techniques industrially employed to deposit these coatings are described, and finally, an insight of the latest research lines currently being developed is also included.

TI DYNAMIC STRAIN-AGING IN A NEW SINGLE-CRYSTAL NICKEL-BASED SUPERALLOY
   (CMSX-4)
SO JOURNAL OF TESTING AND EVALUATION
AB Tensile behavior of a new single crystal nickel-based superalloy with rhenium (CMSX-4) was studied at both room and elevated temperatures in two different hear-treated conditions. Detailed fractographic studies were carried out to determine the micromechanism of crack growth in tensile loading. Round cylindrical tension specimens were prepared from the single crystal nickel-based superalloy CMSX-4 in [001] orientation. The test specimens had the [001] growth direction parallel to the loading axis in tension. The specimens were given two different heat treatments to produce two different gamma' precipitate sizes, i.e., 0.3 mu m and 0.5 mu m, respectively. The tensile properties of these materials were evaluated at room and elevated temperatures in ambient atmosphere as per ASTM E 21, Test Methods for Elevated Temperature Tension Tests of Metallic Materials.
   The results of this investigation indicate that CMSX-4 undergoes dynamic strain aging in the temperature range of 260 degrees to 875 degrees C. This dynamic strain aging appears to take place by the trapping of moving dislocations by the substitutional solute atoms (like rhenium, tantalum, tungsten, cobalt, and molybdenum) during the high-temperature deformation process. Fractographs at lower temperatures (T less than or equal to 800 degrees C) exhibit an unusual type of cleavage fracture with several operative slip systems, while at higher temperatures (T greater than or equal to 1094 degrees C) the crack growth process is characterized by a relatively smooth fracture surface, with the presence of dimples created by ductile failure (typical of many nickel-based superalloys).

TI Thermomechanical material parameters characterization of the superalloy
   PN 3601669-7 under low-velocity impacts
SO JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB This work concerns the characterization of the thermodynamic behavior of the superalloy Airsist 215 (PN 3601669-7) containing cobalt. Such superalloys are used in aeronautical construction, in the hot parts of the turbine. They are frequently used for the production of the paddles. The parts in service are subjected to dynamic solicitations and thermal fluctuations over the course of time. They are responsible for modification and degradation of material properties. This can lead to the appearance of cracks and, in the long term, to the rupture of these parts. In this paper, a preliminary physical study is made on the appearance of the cracks, followed by experiments using shocks at ambient temperature and under a heating situation which simulates combustion. It is found that these dynamic loads have a significant impact on the development of the cracks that appear on the segments of the turbine nozzle. The study is devoted to the elastic shock of Hertz-Boussinesq extended to viscoelastic bodies by direct convolution of Riemann-Stielges. The interest resides in the local convolution and the distribution of stresses in the contact zone. The shock excitation method includes a deduced force in the load and disload phases. This force is an impulse which approaches a Dirac function. The sample can be modeled approximately by a system of one degree of freedom for natural frequency, damping and transfer function. The spectral response of the specified shock allows calculation of the damping. Every point of this spectrum gives the response for the linear system of the transfer function. Then, viscoelastic shock parameters are deduced.

TI Characterization of transient oxide formation on CoNiCrAlY after heat
   treatment in vacuum and air
SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB The application of thin film sensors on hot section components of gas turbine engines requires the formation a specific and complex layered structure that is functional, reliable, and durable. In the case of conducting substrates, such as the nickel- or cobalt-based superalloys, an electrically-insulating layer (typically aluminum oxide) is required between the sensing layer elements and the substrate. In order to achieve suitable bonding of alumina to the substrate, a MCrAlY type bond coat is commonly applied to the metallic substrate and the subsequent formation of dense, adherent oxide(s) on the MCrAlY coating surface can ultimately determine the durability of the layered structure In this work, test specimens consisting of a high-velocity oxy-fuel (HVOF) CoNiCrAlY coated nickel-base substrate were subjected to selected vacuum and air furnace heat treatments in order to observe the effects of the heat treatments on the transient oxide formation on the CoNiCrAlY surface. The surfaces and cross-sectional features of the test specimens were examined using scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy dispersive spectrometry analysis (EDS). together with the X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis Of the heat treatment conditions examined, the vacuum heat treated CoNiCrAlY specimens exhibited the formation of a denser alumina layer while the air furnace heat treatments resulted in a more ridge-like alumina formation on the surface Increasing heat treatment temperature and time reduced the amount of transition metal oxide and encouraged more uniform alumina formation.

AB There are increasing demands placed on manufacturing engineers to improve quality and reduce total cost in their grinding operations. Grinding using CBN (Cubic Boron Nitride) wheels has been well documented in reducing total grinding costs (wheel plus labour plus overhead) on tool and die steels with Re hardness greater than 50 and nickel- and cobalt-based superalloys with HRc hardness greater than 35. Resin-bonded CBN wheels are commonly used in CBN grinding due to their advantages in high speed grinding. However, dressing of resin-bonded CBN wheels is usually a difficulty. In this paper, a free-abrasive machining approach to dressing of CBN grinding wheels is presented. The basis of this method is to indent and drive free abrasive grains on the wheel surface to excavate the binder material between the CBN grains and uncoat the exposed portion of the grains. It is shown that by using the present dressing method CBN wheels can be dressed precisely and efficiently as expected. Experimental results are presented to show the advantages of the present dressing method over other dressing methods in the dressed wheel topography and grinding performance such as the wheel wear, grinding forces, ground workpiece surface roughness and thermal damage. The main parameters in the present dressing method are also considered. It is shown that the wheel topography can be controlled with the average size of the free-abrasive grains used for dressing. There is an optimum value in the grain size, from which the dressed wheel grinds at the lowest forces and highest G ratio. It is also shown that the pressure applied on the dressing plate has a saturation point at which the highest dressing efficiency, and optimum wheel topography and grinding performance can be achieved.

TI The Effects of Tool Position, Coating and Cutting Parameters on Forces,
   Power, MRR and Wear in Face Milling of Stellite 6
SO ARABIAN JOURNAL FOR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
AB High-speed milling is known to be an advanced machining process increasingly used for modern materials such as nickel- or cobalt-based superalloys. In this paper, the effect of machining parameters including cutting velocity, feed rate and depth of cut on tool wear, material removal rate, cutting forces and power in symmetric and asymmetric face milling of Stellite 6 with coated and uncoated inserts has been studied. One hundred and eighty experiments were carried out with different machining conditions. The settings of milling parameters were determined by using general full factorial design method. The analysis of variance was employed to analyze the effect of machining parameters on the cutting forces. Cutting speeds' effect on cutting forces has not been observed. The depth of cut has greater influence on the resultant cutting forces. Experiments show that the milling forces on Z-axis direction (F (z) ) are the highest for symmetric face milling in the table system of cutting forces. The depth of cut and feed rate have greater influence on the resultant cutting forces in the symmetric and asymmetric face milling processes for PVD-coated and uncoated inserts. It is found that if feed rate and depth of cut are increased, the cutting power would increase and the asymmetric milling strategy becomes superior when compared to symmetric milling with more cutting power. Additionally, the end of tool life is more frequently caused by chipping and breakage of the edge rather than regular tool wear because face milling is an interrupted cutting operation.

TI Microstructures and Surface Stabilities of {Ni-0.4C-6Ta-xCr, 0 <= x <=
   50 Wt Pct} Cast Alloys at High Temperature
SO METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND
   MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Nickel-based cast alloys rich in chromium and reinforced by TaC carbides are potentially very interesting alloys for applications at elevated temperatures. Unfortunately, unlike cobalt-chromium and iron-chromium alloys, it is difficult to obtain exclusively TaC as primary carbides in Ni-Cr alloys. In alloys containing 30 wt pct Cr tantalum, carbides coexist with chromium carbides. The latter tend to weaken the alloy at elevated temperatures because they become rapidly spherical and then quickly lose their reinforcing effect. In this work, we attempted to stabilize TaC as a single carbide phase by testing different chromium contents in the [0, 50 wt pct] range. Six alloys containing 0.4C and 6Ta, weight contents corresponding to equivalent molar contents, were elaborated by foundry, and their as-cast microstructures were characterized. Samples of all alloys were exposed to 1127 degrees C and 1237 degrees C for 24 hours to characterize their stabilized microstructures. The surface fractions of chromium carbides and tantalum carbides were measured by image analysis, and their evolutions vs the chromium content were studied. For the chosen C and Ta contents, it appears that obtaining TaC only is possible by decreasing the chromium content to 10 wt pct. At the same time, TaC fractions are unfortunately too low because a large portion of tantalum integrates into the solid solution in the matrix. A second consequence is a critical decrease in oxidation resistance. Other possible methods to stabilize TaC as a single carbide are evocated, such as the simultaneous increase in Ta and decrease in chromium from 30 wt pct Cr.

TI Sliding Wear Behavior of HVOF-sprayed Cr3C2-NiCr/CeO2 Composite Coatings
   at Elevated Temperature up to 800 A degrees C
SO TRIBOLOGY LETTERS
AB Four types of Cr3C2-NiCr coatings containing different fractions of CeO2 additive were deposited using high velocity oxy-fuel spraying. Hardness tester, X-ray diffractometer, contact surface profiler, and scanning electron microscope equipped with energy dispersive spectrometer were employed to characterize the microhardness, phase composition, surface roughness, and microstructure of as-sprayed coatings. At the same time, the friction and wear behavior of the as-sprayed coatings sliding against Si3N4 ball at room temperature and elevated temperature of 400 or 800 A degrees C under unlubricated condition was evaluated using an oscillating friction and wear tester. The worn surfaces of the composite coatings and Si3N4 counterpart balls were analyzed by means of scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and three dimensional non-contact surface profiler. The friction and wear mechanisms of the coatings with and without CeO2 additive were comparatively discussed. Results show that the composite coatings doped with CeO2 had better wear-resistance than that without CeO2, and the coating containing 4 wt% CeO2 showed the best wear-resistant property. The improved wear-resistant properties of the composite coatings doped with CeO2 were attributed to the refined microstructure and improved mechanical properties induced by CeO2.

Investigations on the behaviour of this coating subjected to high-temperature oxidation in air and oxidation-erosion in actual boiler environment at 700 +/- 10 degrees C under cyclic conditions have been carried out. The weight change technique was used to establish the kinetics of oxidation. X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission-scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive spectroscopy (FE-SEM/EDS) and EDS elemental mapping techniques were used to analyse the oxidation/oxidation-erosion products. The uncoated boiler steel suffered from a catastrophic degradation in the form of intense spalling of the scale in both the environments. The Cr3C2-NiCr coating showed good adherence to the boiler steel during the exposures with no tendency for spallation of its oxide scale. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Microstructural characteristics and thermophysical properties of spark
   plasma sintered Inconel 738LC
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY
AB Nickel-based superalloys are used for turbine component parts in the power industry, aircraft engines, and in the marine sector. One such alloy that is available for these purposes is Inconel 738LC (IN738LC) nickel-based superalloy. Therefore, it is pertinent to have good structural and thermal stabilities for high-temperature applications, since these characteristics are important for its performance. In this study, spark plasma sintering technology was used to fabricate IN738LC nickel-based superalloy by using sintering temperature in the range of between 900 and 1200 degrees C. The fabricated products were characterized by using the scanning electron microscope and X-ray diffraction. There was the formation of the gamma '(Ni-3(Ti, Al)) intermetallic phase in the microstructure, which contributed to the material (Inconel 738LC) property. The solid solution elements present are chromium, cobalt, tungsten, and tantalum; these equally contribute to the structural stability of IN738LC. The density, hardness, and the predicted yield strength increased with increasing sintering temperature, while the porosity decreased with increasing sintering temperature. The thermal conductivity, which is an important thermophysical property of IN738LC, enables the evaluation of the usefulness and service life of IN738LC superalloy at high-temperature applications, was also examined. The thermal conductivity was measured by using a laser flash method in the temperature range of 100-600 degrees C. For the sintered alloy, the thermal conductivity was determined as a function of the thermal diffusivity, specific heat capacity, and density. Analysis showed inflection pattern with increase in temperature on the sample fabricated at 900, 1000, and 1100 degrees C, ; a monotonic increase with increase in temperature was observed on the sample fabricated at 1200 degrees C, ; the inflections are associated with the gamma ' precipitates dissolution and redistribution.

TI Experimental Study on Surface Characteristics of Laser Cladding Layer
   Regulated by High-Frequency Microforging
SO JOURNAL OF THERMAL SPRAY TECHNOLOGY
AB High-frequency microforging technology is used to produce micrometer-scale plastic deformation on the surface of material out of the vibration impact of a forging punch, and the cumulative effect of its various frequencies on micrometer-scale plastic deformation can cause changes of surface microstructure and mechanical properties. This study used (1) a self-made machine to treat NiCrBSi alloy, (2) a mechanical comparator and optical microscopy (OM) to study the geometric characteristics of plastic deformation, (3) OM and scanning electric microscopy (SEM) to observe influence on surface microstructure and cracking behavior of the laser cladding layer under microforging, (4) x-ray diffractometer (XRD) to measure the surface residual stress of laser cladding layer before and after forging, and (5) microhardness tester and wearing experimental machine to study changes of microhardness, friction coefficient, and wear characteristics of laser cladding layer after microforging. The results have shown that high-frequency microforging could produce plastic deformation about 150 mu m deep on the surface of NiCrBSi alloy clad by laser. Regular dendrite and eutectic crystallization microstructure, which is a peculiar characteristic of the laser cladding layer, was broken into pieces and formed residual compression residual stress on the surface. Resistance to cracking of laser cladding layer improved greatly, microhardness and wearability increased, and the friction coefficient did not under go a noticeable change.

TI The role of dissolved hydrogen and other trace impurities on propensity
   of tin deposits to grow whiskers
SO MICROELECTRONICS RELIABILITY
AB Early investigators of till whiskers concluded that hydrogen dissolved in till electrodeposits strongly influences the formation of tin whiskers. Early experiments demonstrated that baking immediately after plating mitigated whiskering and this effect was attributed to hydrogen relief. Baking immediately following plating is now widely used to mitigate whiskering, but this effect is routinely attributed to stress relief. A review of recent experimental and theoretical work oil till whiskering, and oil the behavior of hydrogen dissolved into metals has been performed, in all effort to discern whether dissolved hydrogen merits renewed consideration. Recent studies suggest that lower cathode efficiency during electroplating, which implies a higher rate of hydrogen co-deposition, also increases whiskering propensity. Other studies show that the hydrogen content of till electrodeposits call vary by more than a factor of 20. Recent tin whisker growth theories identify the grain boundaries as critical for the whisker phenomenon. Extensive experimental and theoretical work indicate that dissolved hydrogen can have a significant effect oil grain boundaries in a wide range of metals. Studies oil high-temperature behavior of steels and superalloys indicate that the presence of trace impurities concentrated within grain boundaries have a significant effect on macroscopic properties. Since tin is operating in a high-temperature regime at room temperature, trace impurities should also have a significant impact oil macroscopic properties that are dependent upon grain boundaries, such as whiskering. It is recommended that till whisker investigators consider hydrogen content and the content of other trace contaminants as part of their experimental design. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB in this study, the Hastelloy-X superalloy samples were firstly overlaid by a CoNiCrAlY bond coating utilizing a high pressure, high velocity oxygen fuel (HVOF) spray process. Then platinum thin film approx. 7.5 mu m thick was introduced to selected test samples of CoNiCrAlY coatings by a magnetron sputtering deposition process. Then the HVOF sprayed superalloy coupons, with and without Pt coating were pack aluminized for 4 h at 850 degrees C to produce (Co,Ni)Al and PtAl2 aluminide phases on their surfaces, respectively. All specimens were subjected to a thermal cycling test at 1100 degrees C. Then the aluminizing and Pt-aluminizing effects relative to cyclical oxidation behavior and microstructure evolutions of the coatings were evaluated. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffractometry (XRD) and electron probe microanalyzer (EPMA) were used to identify crystalline phases and microstructures of each coating. Results clearly indicated that the surface roughness of the HVOF sprayed CoNiCrAlY coatings were unchanged after aluminizing or the Pt-aluminizing process. The oxide scales spalled after 50 h and 100 h cyclic oxidation for the HVOF sprayed sample and aluminized sample respectively, while the oxide scale attached successfully to the substrate for the Pt-aluminized sample after testing for 150 h. It is obvious that the Pt-aluminizing process significantly improves the oxidation resistance of HVOF sprayed coatings, while the isolated aluminizing process demonstrated negligible effect.

AB In this study, the Hastelloy-X superalloy samples were overlaid by a CoNiCrAlY bond coating using a high pressure high velocity oxygen fuel (HVOF) spray process. A thin platinum film around 7.5 mu m thick was further applied to the surface of CoNiCrAlY coating by the magnetron sputtering deposition. Then the superalloy coupons with bare bond coat and with Pt deposited bond coat were pack aluminized at 850 degrees C for 4 h to produce (Ni,Co)Al and PtAl2 phases on surfaces, respectively. After that, all samples were overlaid with the yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) top coats by air plasma spraying (APS). Then specimens were subjected to a thermal cycling test at 1100 degrees C. Thermal cycling tests were 1 h at 1100 degrees C followed by 10 min of forced-air cooling to ambient temperature outside the furnace. The weights of all the specimens were measured every 2 cycles. Then effects of aluminizing and Pt-aluminizing on the cyclic oxidation performance and microstructure evolutions of the coatings were evaluated. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffractometry (XRD) and electron probe microanalyzer (EPMA) were used to identify crystalline phases and microstructures of each coating. The results proved that the roughness of the CoNiCrAlY coating was not changed after the aluminizing or the Pt-aluminizing process. The specific weight gain of the thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) with aluminizing or with Pt-aluminizing bond coating was lower than that of TBCs with only HVOF sprayed bond coat. The cyclic oxidation life of sprayed MCrAlY/ZrO2-Y2O3 thermal barrier coating can be improved effectively by either aluminizing or Pt-aluminizing treatment. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.
