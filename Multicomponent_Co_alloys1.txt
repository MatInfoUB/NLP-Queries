AB This study discusses the influence of different composition of negative
   electrode material on the performance of Ni-MH cells. Two major groups
   of multicomponent alloys were used during the experiments: AB(5) and
   AB(2) types. The best capacity was observed for the AB(5)-type alloy
   with the highest content of Co in its structure. The presence of Co in
   the alloy increased the capacity of the negative electrode most likely
   as a result of hydriding/dehydriding processes or Faradaic reaction
   following the dissolution-precipitation mechanism. The influence of
   different amounts of nickel (0-20 wt %) was determined. The presence of
   nickel in the electrode materials increased the current density as well
   as the diffusion of hydrogen into the bulk of alloys. Moreover, the
   carbon materials have been used as an additive for negative electrode
   grains in order to increase the conductivity and hydrogen sorption
   properties.

AB Searching for new anti-poisoning Pt-based catalysts with enhanced
   activity for alcohol oxidation is the key in direct alcohol fuel cells
   (DAFCs). However, in the traditional strategy for designing bimetallic
   or multimetallic alloy is still difficult to achieve a satisfactory
   heterogeneous electrocatalyst because the activity often depends on only
   the surface atoms. Herein, we fabricate the multicomponent active sites
   by creating a sulfide structure on 1D PtNiCo trimetallic nanowires
   (NWs), to give a PtNiCo/NiCoS interface NWs (IFNWs). Owing to the
   presence of sulfide interfaces, the PtNiCo/NiCoS IFNWs enable an
   impressive methanol/ethanol oxidation reaction (MOR/EOR) performance and
   excellent anti-CO poisoning tolerance. They have the MOR and EOR mass
   activities of 2.25 Amg(Pt)(-1) and 1.62 Amg(Pt)(-1), around 1.26, 3.21
   and 1.46, 2.96 times higher than those of PtNiCo NWs and commercial
   Pt/C, respectively. CO-stripping and XPS measurements further
   demonstrate that the new interfacial structure and optimal bonding of
   Pt-CO can result in accelerating the removal of surface adsorbed
   carbonaceous intermediates. Moreover, such a unique structure has also
   demonstrated a much-improved ability for the electrochemical detection
   of some important molecules (H2O2 and NH2NH2).

AB We introduce a general approach for synthesizing multicomponent
   metal-decorated crumpled reduced graphene oxide nanocomposites using a
   one-step, continuous flame-based process. Crumpled reduced graphene
   oxide balls (CGB) were produced from graphene oxide (GO) in a High
   Temperature Reducing Jet (HTRJ) reactor. Moreover, CGBs were
   simultaneously decorated with different transition metal nanoparticles,
   including cobalt (Co), nickel (Ni), iron (Fe), and palladium (Pd).
   Various metal alloy-decorated crumpled reduced graphene oxide balls
   (M-CGBs) including CoPd-, CoNi-, CoPdNi-, and CoNiFe-CGBs were
   successfully synthesized using a general recipe. The key advantage of
   the HTRJ system over common flame-based aerosol synthesis methods is the
   separation of flame and product formation zones, which allows production
   and/or reduction of nanomaterials that can be reduced by H-2 in the
   presence of H2O. Nanomaterials are produced from aqueous precursors
   containing low-cost metal salts and dispersed GO. Electron microscopy
   and other characterization methods show the decoration of the CGBs with
   sub-4 nm diameter binary and ternary alloy, non-oxide transition metal
   nanoparticles of controlled compositions. The nanostructures made by
   this process can potentially be used as electrocatalysts for fuel cells,
   electrodes in batteries and supercapacitors, conductive inks for printed
   electronics, catalysts in wastewater treatment, and many other
   applications where a graphitized carbon-metal nanomaterial is needed.

AB Synthesis of nanoalloys containing three or more elements with
   controllable size and morphology and desired phase is very challenging.
   Rare earth (RE)-transition metal (TM) nanoalloys have great potential
   applications, however, their controllable synthesis is even a daunting
   task. Here we find that the direct gas-phase ordering of Sm-Co-based
   nanoalloys (around 5-15 nm) into 1:5 phase without size and shape change
   can be achieved by in-flight annealing through reducing their
   crystallization-ordering temperature (COT) with additive Cu or Ni. The
   homogenous element-distribution and desired phase in these trimetallic
   nanoalloys are evidenced by
   high-resolution-transmission-electron-microscopy analysis despite a
   preferred surface segregation from thermodynamic calculation and
   analysis. Our results demonstrate a promising way to synthesize
   trimetallic nanoalloys especially RE-TM with independently controlled
   size, composition and phase as well as their building-blocks with novel
   functionalities. The reduction in COT of Sm-Co-Cu nanoalloys is further
   confirmed by post-annealing the deposited nanocluster film. A
   significant coercivity-enhancement is achieved at a lower
   annealing-temperature. Compared to Fe-Pt, the higher anisotropy and much
   lower COT of Sm-Co-based nanoalloy make it emerge as a promising
   next-generation recording media with density beyond Fe-Pt. Our study
   also opens a door for fabricating trimetallic or even multicomponent
   nanoalloys with controllable size, composition and phase. (C) 2019 The

   influence of replacement for W in multicomponent Co-based alloys with 30
   at. pct Ni and 12 at. pct Cr. Either Mo or Nb additions at the expense
   of W reduce alloy density to a similar extent. Increasing Mo
   substitution significantly decreases the gamma ' volume fraction and
   results in spherical gamma ' morphology at 750 degrees C, whereas Nb
   substitution shows opposite effects on the gamma ' volume fraction and
   morphology. Accordingly, the Mo and Nb additions raise and decrease the
   microhardness and high-temperature compression strength, respectively.
   The results can provide reference for the development of Co-based
   superalloys with low density and high strength.

   phase and formed precipitates. Up to three types of precipitates, with
   characteristic size from 10-30 nm to 200-300 nm, have been detected and
   studied. Electric and thermal properties of the material, measured at

AB The thermoelectric properties of 54 different group 4 half-Heusler (HH)
   alloys have been studied from first principles. Electronic transport was
   studied with density functional theory using hybrid functionals
   facilitated by the k . p method, while the temperature-dependent
   effective potential method was used for the phonon contributions to the
   figure of merit ZT. The phonon thermal conductivity was calculated
   including anharmonic phonon-phonon, isotope, alloy, and grain-boundary
   scattering. HH alloys have an XYZ composition, and those studied here
   are in the group 4-9-15 (Ti,Zr,Hf)(Co,Rh,Ir)(As,Sb,Bi) and group 4-10-14
   (Ti,Zr,Hf)(Ni,Pd,Pt)(Ge,Sn,Pb). The electronic part of the thermal
   conductivity was found to significantly impact ZT and thus the optimal
   doping level. Furthermore, the choice of functional was found to
   significantly affect thermoelectric properties, particularly for
   structures exhibiting band alignment features. The intrinsic thermal
   conductivity was significantly reduced when alloy and grain-boundary
   scattering were accounted for, which also reduced the spread in thermal
   conductivity. It was found that sublattice disorder on the Z-site, i.e.,
   the site occupied by group 14 or 15 elements, was more effective than
   X-site substitution, occupied by group 4 elements. The calculations
   confirmed that ZrNiSn, ZrCoSb, and ZrCoBi based alloys display promising
   thermoelectric properties. A few other n-type and p-type compounds were
   also predicted to be potentially excellent thermoelectric materials,
   given that sufficiently high charge carrier concentrations can be
   achieved. This study provides insight into the thermoelectric potential
   of HH alloys and casts light on strategies to optimize the
   thermoelectric performance of multicomponent alloys. Published under

AB Ir-based binary and ternary alloys are effective catalysts for the
   electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic solutions.
   Nevertheless, decreasing the Ir content to less than 50 at% while
   maintaining or even enhancing the overall electrocatalytic activity and
   durability remains a grand challenge. Herein, by dealloying predesigned
   Al-based precursor alloys, it is possible to controllably incorporate Ir
   with another four metal elements into one single nanostructured phase
   with merely approximate to 20 at% Ir. The obtained nanoporous quinary
   alloys, i.e., nanoporous high-entropy alloys (np-HEAs) provide infinite
   possibilities for tuning alloy's electronic properties and maximizing
   catalytic activities owing to the endless element combinations.
   Particularly, a record-high OER activity is found for a quinary
   AlNiCoIrMo np-HEA. Forming HEAs also greatly enhances the structural and
   catalytic durability regardless of the alloy compositions. With the
   advantages of low Ir loading and high activity, these np-HEA catalysts
   are very promising and suitable for activity tailoring/maximization.

   was composed of a single FCC phase in both as-cast and 1000 degrees C
   annealed states. Small amount of B2 phase precipitated after 800 degrees

   of a single B2 phase, it would transform to four phases of BCC + B2 +
   FCC + sigma after 800 degrees C annealing, and to two phases of B2 + FCC
   after 1000 degrees C annealing for the sigma phase is not stable at 1000
   degrees C. Moreover, experimental results indicated that the alloy
   hardness increased with the Al content. The existence of the sigma phase
   could obviously harden the alloy. Except for the alloys with sigma
   precipitation, the hardness of the annealed alloys was lower than that
   of the as-cast ones. In addition, increasing the annealing temperature
   coarsened the grains and softened the alloys.

AB Alloying palladium (Pd) catalysts with various metalloid and nonmetal
   elements can improve their catalytic performance in different chemical
   reactions. However, current nanosynthesis methods can only generate Pd
   alloys containing one metalloid or nonmetal, which limits the types of
   element combinations that may be used to improve Pd-based nanocatalysts.
   Herein, we report a simple soft-templating synthetic strategy to
   co-alloy Pd with the metalloid boron (B) and the nonmetal phosphorus (P)
   to generate ternary PdBP mesoporous nanospheres (MSs) with
   three-dimensional dendritic frameworks. We use a one-step aqueous
   synthesis method where dimethylamine borane and sodium hypophosphite
   serve as the B and P sources, respectively, as well as the co-reducing
   agents to drive the nucleation and growth of ternary PdBP alloy on a
   sacrificial dioctadecyldimethylammonium chloride template. The
   concentration of metalloid to nonmetal and the diameters of dendritic
   MSs can be tailored. The synthetic protocol is also extended to other
   multicomponent PdMBP alloy MSs to generate different types of dendritic
   mesoporous frameworks. Boron and phosphorus are known to accelerate the
   kinetics of the electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and
   alcohol oxidation reactions (AORs), because their alloys promote the
   decomposition of oxygen-containing intermediates on Pd surfaces. The
   dendritic mesoporous morphology of the ternary PdBP MSs also accelerates
   electron/mass transfer and exposes numerous active sites, enabling
   better performance in the ORR and AORs. Extending the
   surfactant-templating synthetic route to multiple types of elements will
   enable the generation of libraries of multicomponent
   metal-metalloid-nonmetal alloy nanostructures with functions that are
   suitable for various targeted applications.

AB In this paper, a CALPHAD (CALculation of PHAse Diagram)-based viscosity
   model has been established for multicomponent liquid systems, using
   Al-Ni-Fe-Co melt as an example. Firstly, the viscosity databases of pure
   Fe and Co liquids were assessed following an Arrhenius equation based on
   the available experimental viscosity data. The viscosity databases of
   pure Ni and Al liquids were adopted from our previous research and
   literature. Subsequently, viscosity databases of the Al-Fe, Al-Co,
   Fe-Co, Fe-Ni, Co-Ni binary liquids were assessed using the CALPHAD model
   and compared with the available experimental viscosity data. For the
   first time, the temperature-and composition-dependent binary interaction
   parameters were used to describe the non-linear viscous behavior due to
   the chemical short-range order. The viscosities of ternary Al-Fe-Ni
   liquid were predicted from the databases directly extrapolated from
   sub-binary systems using the Redlish-kister-Muggjanu model. The good
   agreement of viscosity between present calculations and available
   experiments in Al alloy melts demonstrated that the CALPHAD-based
   viscosity model is suitable for predicting the viscosity of
   multicomponent liquids as well as their complex
   temperature-composition-phase-viscosity relationships. (C) 2019 Elsevier

AB On the basis of measured interdiffusivity matrices from our previous
   research and thermodynamic descriptions, atomic mobilities for fcc_A1
   Co-V-W alloys were evaluated by diffusion controlled transformation
   software. For the purpose of verifying the reliability of the present
   atomic mobilities, comparisons between the predicted data containing
   interdiffusivity matrices, composition profiles, as well as diffusion
   paths and the experimental ones were conducted. The results demonstrate
   that presently obtained atomic mobilities can reproduce experimental
   data reasonably. Furthermore, three-dimensional surfaces for the
   diagonal interdiffusivities at 1373, 1423 and 1473K were plotted and
   were compared with measured ones, from which the pre-exponential factor
   and activation energy for elements V and W were then derived by means of
   Arrhenius equation. It is worth mentioning that all of the composition
   profiles and diffusion paths at three temperatures can be reasonably
   predicted by the present atomic mobilities containing only two ternary
   interaction parameters. Such a high simulation accuracy is rarely
   reported in the literature. The present atomic mobilities contribute to
   computational design for novel Co-based superalloys and multi-component
   cemented carbides.

AB The mechanical properties due to solid solution strengthening are
   explored within the single phase face-centered cubic (fcc) domain of the
   Co-Cr-Fe-Mn Ni high entropy alloy (HEA) system. This is achieved by
   combining an efficient and reproducible metallurgical processing of
   alloys to X-ray diffraction and nanoindentation characterization
   techniques, thus enabling to get access to 24 different bulk alloys.
   Large variations of nanohardness are seen with composition. Experimental
   results are rationalized in terms of lattice misfit and elastic constant
   variations with alloy-composition, through the use of an analytical
   mechanistic theory for the temperature-, composition- and
   strain-rate-dependence of the initial yield strength of fcc HEAs, with
   predictions made using only experimental inputs. The good agreement
   obtained by comparing model predictions to experiments provides the
   basic framework for mechanical properties optimization within the
   Co-Cr-Fe-Mn-Ni system; the approach could be systematically applied to
   all classes of fcc HEAs. (C) 2019 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by

AB The properties and microstructural evolution of quaternary Cu-Ni-Co-Si
   alloys with different Ni/Co mass ratios are investigated systematically.
   These alloys exhibit higher mechanical properties when the Ni/Co mass
   ratio is 1.12-1.95 (NC-4-NC-5) and show excellent electrical
   conductivity when the Ni/Co mass ratio is 0.05-0.5 (NC-1-NC-3). With an
   increase in the Ni/Co ratio, the dimension of precipitated phase
   continues to increase and the grain size also visibly grows and
   coarsens. At the same time, the precipitation process of the NC-5 alloy
   is the most adequate, resulting in the highest mechanical properties. In
   addition, the precipitated phase in the alloys was confirmed to be the
   (Ni, Co)(2)Si composite phase. The number of Ni2Si phases in the
   precipitated phase gradually increased, and the Ni atoms exhibited the
   strongest co-segregation alongside the increasing Ni/Co ratio. Compared
   with the alloy without a Co element, the addition of Co helped refine
   the grain size and accelerate the precipitation of the particle phase
   and purify solute atoms in the matrix, thereby simultaneously improving
   mechanical properties and conductivity. The present work provides a new
   method for the development of multicomponent Cu-Ni-Si-Co-X alloys with
   outstanding comprehensive performance.

AB We investigated the co-precipitation kinetics, microstructural evolution
   and interfacial segregation in multi component nano-precipitated steels
   strengthened by Cu-rich precipitates (CRPs), NiAl-type particles and
   Mo2C carbides. Aging hardness evolution of Fe-2Cu, Fe-2Cu-5Ni-3Mn-1.5Al
   and Fe-2Cu-5Ni-3Mn-1.5Al-1Mo (wt%) steels with elevating aging
   temperatures showed typical aging hardening-peak hardening-overaging
   response. The results of co-precipitates characterized by atom probe
   tomography and transmission electron microscopy showed that Mo addition
   obviously slowed down the diffusion of Mn and Cu, delaying the evolution
   of elemental concentrations, time of peak hardness, and the nucleation
   of Ni(Al, Mn) precipitates. The sequence of co-precipitates involved
   CRPs and NiAl precipitates during aging was as follows: CRPs + NiAl
   particles -> Cu/NiAl adjacency structure + NiAl particles ->
   Cu-core/NiAl-shell structure, and Mo addition was incapable of changing
   the sequence of co-precipitation. Mo2C carbides nucleated
   heterogeneously behind co-precipitates of CRPs and Ni(Al, Mn)
   precipitates. Co-precipitation kinetics using differential scanning
   calorimetry (DSC) analysis and Johnson-Mehl-Arvami (JMA) equation
   indicated that the activation energy values for the nucleation and
   growth of CRPs in Fe-Cu steel were 97.3 kJ/mol and 182.610/mol,
   respectively, and the two activation energy values for the nucleation
   and growth of co-precipitates in the Fe-Cu-Ni-Mn-Al steel were 74.1
   kJ/mol and 187.7 kJ/mol, respectively.

AB Objectives:ADVOS multi is a recirculating albumin-based dialysis device
   that supports kidney, liver and lung function by eliminating CO2,
   water-soluble and protein-bound substances. In the present work in vitro
   data on the removal of these substances and CO2 are presented. Methods:
   An ex vivo model using porcine blood was established and applied in
   detoxification tests for water soluble and protein bound retention
   solutes. 3 x 3.3L of blood with high bilirubin (30 mg/dl) and lactate
   levels (>10 mmol/l) were treated with ADVOS multi for 4 hours each. This
   design, with 3 phases changing blood every 4 hours, led to high
   concentrations of both markers in blood during the 12 h test period. For
   CO2 removal tests, 5 liters of blood were used instead. In both cases, a
   continuous CO2 supply through an additional dialyzer was applied.
   Results: Bilirubin and lactate were efficiently removed during 12hrs of
   in vitro detoxification. Lactate removal rates were 90%, 86% and 84% for
   phase 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Bilirubin elimination rates were 66%,
   62%, and 57%, resulting in a total elimination of 1150 mg in 12 hrs.
   Albumin binding capacity was determined to be >76% at the end of the
   treatment indicating that albumin was not denatured in the dialysate of
   the ADVOS system. CO2 removal with ADVOS multi depends on three
   variables: 1) The amount of supplied CO2 depends on concentrate flow
   affecting both, blood pCO2 and bicarbonate levels; 2) blood flow, and 3)
   dialysate pH and composition (i.e., carbonate concentration). A maximum
   CO2 removal of 142 ml/min was achieved with a carbonate-free dialysate
   at pH 10, a blood flow of 400 ml/min and a concentrate flow of 160
   ml/min. Given that blood gases are maintained within physiological
   conditions, a CO2 removal rate of 61 ml/min can be achieved. During all
   the experiments blood pH was set to 7.35-7.45. Discussion:ADVOS multi is
   a device using albumin recirculation in its secondary circuit. Here,
   albumin binding capacity remains stable through a systematic
   modification of its tertiary structure through temperature and pH
   changes in the ADVOS multi circuit. This facilitates the release of
   toxins from albumin and allows for further binding. Moreover, presence
   of albumin, variable dialysate composition and the flexible dialysate pH
   might facilitate the treatment of patients with multiple organ failure.
   Objectives:Given the extent of bypass graft failure, the motivation
   behind this multidisciplinary project is to improve the patency of the
   current bypass grafts by developing a novel and optimised blood flow
   augmentation technique. Methods: One of the most significant
   contributions to the improvement of haemodynamics in grafts was based on
   a research which showed that the 'spiral flow' is a natural phenomenon
   in the whole arterial system and is induced by the twisting of the left
   ventricle during contraction and then accentuated upon entering the
   aortic arch. The benefit of this flow pattern lies in removing
   unfavourable haemodynamic environment such as turbulence, stagnation and
   oscillatory shear stress, which are believed to be the main causes of
   intimal hyperplasia at anastomotic configurations. Results:This
   multi-disciplinary engineering venture has resulted in a unique product
   which makes use of both non-planar helicity and an optimised internal
   ridge within the graft to achieve a significantly improved haemodynamic
   condition within the anastomosis (an anastomosis is a surgical
   connection between autologous/prosthetic grafts and veins/arteries
   inside the human body) Discussion:This truly multidisciplinary project
   has integrated fluid mechanics, biomechanics and biology with
   cardiovascular surgery to develop a novel biomedical device, inspired by
   the nuclear engineering sector. The novel spiral-inducing bypass graft,
   nominated for this award, is the best example of how engineering
   techniques, tools and designs can lead to life-saving innovations that
   could potentially save the lives of thousands of people and save
   millions of pounds for the healthcare systems across the world. Such
   successful engineering stories are what would encourage the next
   generation of engineers to go beyond the traditional boundaries of
   engineering disciplines to make a difference.
   Objectives:The goal of this work was to study methods that will allow
   increase in spatial freedom of couplers orientation in inductive
   powering unit for implantable medical devices. An inductive energy
   transfer system is considered, therefore the freedom of relative
   orientation of the transmitting and receiving coils must be optimized.
   Methods:The design procedure of inductive powering unit (IPU) consists
   of two main steps: design of the power amplifier and optimization of an
   inductive link. To account for the patient specifics, such as tissue
   thickness near the implantation site, a number of different couplers
   were simulated using finite element modeling. Effect of coils
   geometrical parameters on mutual inductance and inductive link
   efficiency was examined. Class E power amplifier was chosen as a driver
   for the transmitting coil. Capacitors in the amplifier loading network
   were tuned to achieve zero-voltage switching (ZVS). A patient's everyday
   activity, including walking and even breathing, leads to misalignment of
   the transmitting and receiving coils, and, as a result, detuning of the
   amplifier from ZVS and increased losses. Feedback schemes were studied
   to compensate the misalignments effect on the amplifier. Results:A
   self-oscillating IPU with class E amplifier was designed that provides
   stable output power about 0.5 W for the distance between the couplers in
   range 10-20 mm and the lateral distance up to 20 mm. The use of
   self-oscillating circuit in the transmitter increases spatial freedom of
   the transmitting and receiving coils corresponding to ZVS. Discussion:
   Inductive link geometrical parameters optimization and implementation of
   self-oscillating class E driver the IPU contributes to stable output
   power and efficiency of IPU. As a result, less intervention from the
   patient and physician is required, and patient quality of life is
   increased Precision medicine emerges from integration of a number of
   emerging technologies and the data they produce with modern data
   analytics. For precision diagnostics and for predicting drug responses
   new computational and in-vitro models are needed from gene regulation to
   cellular and organ functions. Human induced pluripotent stem cells
   (hIPSC) derived e.g., from patient blood cells provide means to produce
   most cell types and thus provide means to get patient specific in-vitro
   models. New technologies are needed to produce tissues from these cells
   and to assess the cell functions in-vitro. In addition, computational
   in-silico models can be used to augment our understanding of the
   diseases or drug effects. They also provide tools to translate the
   in-vitro findings to clinical settings and patient populations. We are
   in transition to turn our in-vitro cell culture models to body-on-chip
   platforms including environmental control and biophysical functional
   sensing. We have developed methods to assess the cellular functions
   based on electrophysiological sensing as well as 2D and 3D bioimaging.
   For example, we have developed imaging methods to assess functions of
   hIPSC cardiac cell with simultaneous assessment of electrophysiology
   such as Calcium and voltage transients as well as mechanobiology in
   vitro. Further, we have developed in-silico models of various cellular
   function including multi-cell-type neuronal networks and in-silico
   population models of the hIPSC cardiomyocytes. The later ones are
   providing us ionic machinery of hIPSC derived cardiomyocyte
   electrophysiology in various populations of patiets.
   We have shown that these computational models can represent pathological
   patient phenotype cells and populations of patients with specific
   mutations, e.g., long QT syndrome. We have also demonstrated the power
   of in-silico as possible pre-screening method for drug effects prior to
   in-vitro examinations. Moreover, our in-silico results highlight the
   need of careful consideration of use of HiPSC models before they can be
   turned from immature cell models to mature tissues in vitro. With
   integration of novel engineering expertise from multimodal sensing,
   imaging and computational modelling, we have shown their power on
   studying diseases and for pre-screening of compounds. Our results
   demonstrate the power of combined in-vitro and in-silco methods for
   future precision medicine.
   Objectives: We have developed in vivo tissue engineered autologous
   vascular grafts constructed in the subcutaneous of the recipient body.
   However, since the formation of the vascular grafts depends on the
   conditions of recipients including high risk or immature patients,
   immaturity in the fabricated tissues might be problematic for the
   severely diseased patients because of their suppressed regenerative
   activity. Therefore, possibility of the xenogeneic or the allogeneic
   implantation of the grafts should be evaluated. The objective of this
   study is to fabricate cardiovascular grafts using xenogeneic or
   allogeneic animals. Methods: Silicone rod molds were placed into
   subcutaneous pouches of beagle dogs, and after 4 weeks the implants with
   their surrounded connective tissues were harvested. Those were
   decellularized with detergents and stored at -20 degrees C for 1 week.
   Decellularized tubular connective tissues (internal diameter: 2 mm) were
   xeno-transplanted to abdominal aorta of the rats. Decellularized tubular
   connective tissues (internal diameter: 5 mm) were cut open and trimmed
   to elliptical sheets of 15 x 8 mm, they were allo-transplanted to
   carotid arteries of other beagle dogs as vascular patches. Results: Both
   xenogeneic vascular grafts and allogeneic patch grafts performed well
   after transplantation, and the luminal surfaces after resection were
   very smooth. Histological evaluation also showed host cells infiltration
   into the grafts. Discussion: Decellularized xenogeneic and allogeneic
   connective tissue membranes could be ideal vascular grafts.
   Objectives: This work aimed to print high-resolution, collagen-based,
   constructs via suspended 3D printing with load-bearing and compositions
   closer to native bone; for potential use as implant materials. Methods:
   Collagen type I (Col) and gelatin methacroylate (GelMA) blends were
   systematically investigated as bio-inks, probing their rheological
   properties and crosslinking efficiency for printing. An adapted 3D
   bioprinter (3DDiscovery, regenHU, Switzerland) based on an extrusion
   principle was used to print constructs. Calcification was investigated,
   in vitro, using a polymer-induced liquid precursor for the
   mineralization process. Results: Careful control over the formulation
   and processing resulted in refined construct properties such as: wall
   width (500um), lattice length (2cm) and shape (bone trabeculae). Once
   printed, the ability to cure the GelMA/Col blends was dependent on
   photo-polymerisation methodology, with enhanced curing and lower
   remaining soluble fractions (10% vs 40%) for visible light +
   Riboflavin/SPS in comparison to UV + Irgacure. Control over the
   construct structure allowed defined mineralisation, and subsequent
   material responses. Discussion: In recent years the development of 3D
   printing technologies has attempted to combat the growing need for bone
   repair solutions, although is limited by the number of bio-inks, and
   printable resolutions available. Suspended manufacture has sought to
   address this issue, using a fluid gel to support a secondary
   biologically relevant bio-ink whilst it undergoes a curing step, during
   or post-printing. To date, printing techniques have not been shown to
   provide fully resorbable and/or mechanically satisfactory bone implants.
   This research has shown promise as the first steps towards printing high
   resolution constructs with chemical compositions more closely matching
   that of natural bone. Further works involve deeper investigation of
   calcification and impact on implants mechanical properties and
   microstructure.
   Shifting from treating symptoms to curing chronic diseases by making the
   transformative promise of Advanced Therapies a reality for the benefit
   of patients and society and by making Europe a spearhead of Advanced
   Therapies in Science, Clinics and Biomedical Industry, that is the
   vision of the large-scale research initiative RESTORE - Health by
   Advanced Therapies. The increasing prevalence of chronic diseases and
   multi-morbidity due to demographic factors represents a high
   socio-economic burden for Europe. The direct health costs increased by
   50% during the last decade and reached euro1.526bn in 2017, a staggering
   9.6 % of Europe's GDP. As current therapies rarely cure, but merely
   fight symptoms, never-ending treatment is required, which means
   diminished quality-of-life, adverse effects and soaring cost for
   society. There is a high need to reach sustainable improvement for
   patients or even to cure them of chronic diseases - in other words, to
   disrupt the paradigm of "treating symptoms" with "restoring health".
   Advanced Therapies are the game changers that open up transforming
   therapeutic opportunities. For genetic diseases, immune diseases, cancer
   and tissue injury potential cures through Advanced Therapies exist - it
   is reality, not fiction. Some products are already on the market, mostly
   for rare diseases which means only a few thousand patients worldwide
   have benefitted from Advanced Therapies until now. At the advent of such
   a trailblazing change, obstacles and roadblocks abound. To make the
   disruptive promise of Advanced Therapies to cure chronic diseases a
   reality and to make Advanced Therapies accessible as standard-of-care
   for every European patient in need, RESTORE envisage to establish a
   sustainable pan-European ecosystem integrating transdisciplinary
   research, clinics, patients, and industry. Please join us for more
   details. RESTORE is funded by the EU for the preparatory phase of the
   large-scale research initiative (h2020, No 820292).
   Our main objective is to develop safe medical products for a
   minimally-invasive surgical intervention that fulfill all requirements
   by the new Medical Device Regulation (MDR). The secondary objective is
   to minimize the time to market by implementing standard conforming
   processes in a minimalistic way so they can be operated by only a
   handful of people. The twist in the story is that one of our products of
   our system will be individualized in the operating theater. While
   basically everybody is forced to operate in a "learning by doing" mode
   regarding MDR compliance, we do rely on external trainings provided by
   notified bodies and other sources like websites, webinars, and dedicated
   conferences to learn more about how to fulfil regulatory requirements.
   Additionally, we are partnering with our strategic investor (a
   manufacturer of class-III implantable active devices) to receive
   trainings and advice regarding regulatory affairs. However, it has to be
   stressed that one has to consider all parts of the MDR, especially the
   annexes and the applicable norms. Here we present our technical approach
   and our strategy on how we aim full MDR compliance. We established a
   completely digital workflow for all our documents, including
   cryptographic signatures, version history, reviews, mainly based on open
   source tools. This allows us to handle the document management very
   swiftly. We have one person dedicated to our quality management system.
   The risk management is integrated as a cross-cutting-concern into all
   the product development processes. The main challenge in the planning
   and founding phase of OtoJig GmbH was and still is to estimate what has
   to be done, which norms do apply, and how much effort (time and money)
   it is to perform the steps and create all the required documents. A
   difficulty is that contradicting statements between the MDR and other
   applicable norms are still under interpretation and public discussion.
   Objectives: The aim of this work is to study the influence of person
   physiology and anatomy, which include postoperative edema, movement and
   breathing of a patient, on the results of designing of inductive
   powering unit (IPU) for VAD and to propose design recommendations.
   Methods: A characteristic feature of the IPU is the misalignment of the
   coils. The stability of the VAD power supply (especially with continuous
   powering) is very important. Therefore, it is necessary to design an IPU
   tolerant to coil misalignment. The procedure of geometrical optimization
   for increasing the stability of energy transfer of IPU was performed for
   3 axial distances between coils d (8, 10, 12 mm), which is a typical
   misalignment with a postoperative edema. The lateral misalignment of the
   coils reached the value of the outer radius of the receiving coil (35
   mm), which characterizes the patient movement or breathing. The
   operating frequency was taken 1 MHz, and the output power of the system
   was 10 W. The power drop was within 10%. The results were verified by
   numerical simulation in MATLAB and PSpice. Results: It was found that
   with a decrease of d from 12 to 10 and 8 mm, the optimal outer radius of
   the transmitting coil increases from 53.9 to 54.6 and 55.7 mm. Turn
   pitch in the transmitting coil increases from 4.9 to 5.2 and 5.3 mm. For
   a receiving coil, turns pitch is increasing from 3 to 3.2 and 3.6,
   respectively. For all cases of d in each coil there are 11 turns (except
   for d = 8 mm, where there are 10 turns in the receiving coil). It is
   recommended to design coils with a slightly larger coils turns pitch and
   the outer radius of the transmitting coil because of disappearance of
   postoperative edema. Discussion: In this work, the influence of person
   physiology and anatomy on the design of IPU for VAD was investigated,
   and recommendations for designing were given.
   Objectives: Membrane oxygenators are an indispensable part of critical
   care medicine. Though necessary to supply sufficient gas exchange, the
   high intrinsic surface introduced by the hollow fiber packing has
   serious side effects on blood platelet parameters. To reduce these side
   effects the membrane surface must be minimized and gas exchange
   improved. Methods: Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) can support
   oxygenator optimization and supplement experimental data by delivering a
   spatial and temporal resolution of the gas exchange. While current
   research mostly focusses on the gas transport in the blood flow, this
   work presents a fully resolved CFD approach including transmembrane
   transport as well as convective and diffusive blood gas transport on
   shell- and lumen-side of the hollow fibers. Results: CO2 transport in a
   packing segment of a prototype hollow fiber module was fully resolved
   and simulated utilizing an inhouse solver membraneFoam based on the open
   source CFD code OpenFOAM (R). Simulation results show a CO2 partial
   pressure decline from 50 to 15 mmHg in the laminar boundary layer and an
   additional drop of 12 mmHg at the selective membrane surface. Boundary
   conditions for the gas transport simulations were computed by blood flow
   simulations of the whole module. Simulation results were compared to in
   vitro tests comprising measurements of CO2 exchange performance and
   blood side pressure drop of the prototype module. Discussion: Flow
   simulations predict the experimentally determined pressure drop of 68
   mmHg at blood flow rates of 1280 mL/min accurately. The specific CO2
   exchange rate of 220 mL STP/min/m2 is overpredicted due to the reduction
   of the whole packing to an idealized packing segment. Nevertheless, CFD
   allows for a structured optimization of membrane oxygenators as design
   changes can be efficiently investigated.
   Objectives: Anticoagulation therapy in LVAD patients is essential to
   reduce hemocompatibility related adverse events (HRAE). Phenprocoumon
   dose must be adapted and monitored by INR point-of-care-testing (POCT)
   in outpatients. The study aims to determine if the frequency of INR POCT
   in LVAD outpatients has an influence on the quality of anticoagulation
   therapy, HRAE and clinical outcomes. Methods: This retrospective,
   pseudo-randomized study included n=48 patients who received an LVAD
   implantation (HMII, HM3 and HVAD) between Jan. 2012 and Oct. 2016. Based
   on the frequency of weekly INR POCT, we compared a daily (n=36) and a
   3x/week (n=12) group, specifically the 1-year anticoagulation quality (%
   of INR Tests in Range) as well as clinical outcomes, readmissions and
   HRAE using Kaplan-Meier curves. Readmission profiles and outcomes in
   three groups, based on the achieved quality of anticoagulation (% of INR
   Tests in Range) ranging from 0-60% (poor), 60-70% (acceptable), 70-100%
   (well controlled) were compared. Results: Daily and 3x/week groups were
   similar in demographic and pre-operative risk factors, INR target
   (2.0-3.0, p=0.27) and Aspirin daily doses (p=0.29). Freedom from any
   HRAE (38.9% vs. 25.0%, p=0.44), any readmission (72.2% vs. 75.0%,
   p=0.97) and 1-year survival (91.7% vs. 91.7%, p=0.98) were comparable in
   both groups. The % of INR Tests in Range was significantly higher with
   the daily self-assessments (73.5% vs. 68.4%, p=0.006). Freedom from any
   neurological event (91.7% vs. 75.0%, p=0.14) was n.s. higher in the
   daily POCT group. Well vs. poorly controlled INR POCT patients had a
   significant higher freedom from any neurological event (96.0 vs 69.2%,
   p=0.024) as well as hemorrhagic strokes (100% vs. 76.9%, p=0.011).
   Discussion: Well controlled anticoagulation of LVAD outpatients results
   in less neurological events including hemorrhagic stroke. Daily INR POCT
   and subsequent dose adjustment of vitamin-K antagonists result in a
   better quality of anticoagulation than 3x/week checks.
   Objectives: Spectroscopic method is widely used for non-invasive blood
   glucose (BG) measurement. Despite the progress in implementation of
   transmission NIR-spectroscopic method, applicable mostly for earlap
   measurements, research of non-transmission methods allows for the
   exapnsion of spectroscopy range of use. The aim of research is to
   estimate the penetration depth for 1600 nm radiation using reflection
   NIR-spectroscopy. Sufficiency of penetration depth on this wavelength
   would allow for the use of a mathematical model implemented in the
   transmission method. Methods: The developed experimental setup includes
   a semiconductor laser with wavelength of 1600 nm, two photodiodes,
   reflecting surface, control unit and power supply. For determining the
   position of optical elements a MATLAB program was developed, which
   calculated efficient detected radiation intensity depending on distances
   between the photodiode and the laser and between the laser and
   reflective surface. Scheme for measuring BG by reflection
   NIR-spectroscopy partially repeats the scheme used for transmission
   method. The main differences are in location of photodiodes on the same
   plane with the radiation source, while their optical axes are co-aligned
   and parallel to each other, and the reflecting surface tightly abuts the
   back wall of analytical cell with test solution. Results: The optimal
   distance between the photodiode and the laser is 5 mm, and between the
   laser and the reflective surface is 20 mm. This configuration allows
   intensity of the reflected radiation at about 20% of incident radiation
   to be obtained. Taking into account the permissible radiation density
   for skin, this value is enough for skin probing to a depth of 1.5 mm.
   Discussion: Reflection NIR-spectroscopy is promising method for
   non-invasive BG measurement. Research of transmission method has shown
   that the penetration depth of 1.5 mm is enough for receiving information
   about BG. Thereby mathematical apparatus applied for transmission
   NIR-spectroscopy can be used and similar error less than 20% can be
   expected.
   Objectives: Proper anatomical fitting of implants is crucial for a
   successful clinical outcome. However, every patient's anatomy is unique
   and there is a wide variety in the anatomical and morphological
   characteristics among individuals. Virtual fitting based on imaging data
   of a high number of patients has crucial benefits compared to
   conventional approaches during the design process. Methods: Population
   based engineering is a method that enables a virtual implantation
   combined with iterative design optimization based on 3D anatomical
   models created from imaging data of a high cohort of patients. This
   approach was successfully used during the design process of a novel
   inflow cannula for a Ventricular Assist Device and a Total Artificial
   Heart for maximizing the number of treatable patients. The objective was
   to create a design that contains all components, but which at the same
   time works for a wide variety of different body types and sizes.
   Results: The virtual studies have proven to give results that may not
   have been possible with conventional approaches. Compared with cadaver
   studies, this approach was a more accurate and economical way for
   determining the device fit and identifying areas for improvement.
   Clinical trials and in vivo studies of the devices have shown positive
   outcomes. Virtual fitting was able to reduce the risk of inflow
   obstruction, device-vessel misalignment, unexpected variabilities in the
   patient's anatomy and improper patient selection due to anatomical
   constraints. Discussion: Population based engineering is a
   cost-effective solution for including a large number of patients and
   anatomy variations in the design process. Additionally, this approach
   can be used for regulatory submission, e.g. to determine and justify
   anatomical and morphological eligibility or exclusion criteria for
   proper patient selection and/or the correct implant size. This is
   especially important in consideration of the future requirements of the
   Medical Device Regulation (MDR) for patient-specific implants.
   Objectives: None Alcoholic Fatty Liver disorders (NAFLD)is a complex
   systemic disorder becauseit is associated with clinical states such as
   obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes thus involving both
   liver and pancreas. In particular, pathological pancreas (such as in
   diabetic patients, in non-alcoholic fatty pancreas disorders patients)
   led to mis control of insulin secretion (the insulin modulates the lipid
   accumulation in liver). Methods: Organ on chip approaches is one way to
   mimic human physiology. In this paper, we will present the development
   of a liver, pancreas and liver pancreas co-culture model to simulate the
   interaction between both organs. Results: The morphological analysis
   confirmed the rat hepatocytes and the rat Langehrans islets were
   cultivated successfully after the extraction for 7 days. The tissues
   functionality was confirmed by the production of albumin in the liver on
   chip models and by the insulin secretion in the pancreas biochips. The
   RTqPCR analysis confirmed that the pancreas on chip culture contribute
   to maintain high level mRNA of genes related to glucose insulin
   homeostasis when compared to Petri control. Then, the GLP1 drug
   contribute to increase the insulin metabolism in pancreas on chip. In
   liver pancreas co-culture, we found that the presence of pancreas islet
   contributed to modify the mRNA levels of glucose-insulin homeostasis
   related genes in the hepatocytes. It also contributed to increase the
   insulin production when compared to pancreas biochip control.
   Discussion: Those results demonstrated the potential of our liver
   pancreas model to be upgraded to a complex disease model.
   Objectives: We are developing a novel autologous tissue-engineered heart
   valve with a unique in-body tissue engineering. This is expected to be a
   viable bioprosthesis with better biocompatibility. In this study, we
   developed a conduit-type valve without any foreign materials and tested
   the feasibility and long-term availability in large animal experiments.
   Methods: We created plastic molds for Biovalves with a 3D printer easily
   and quickly considering the recipient character. We embedded them in the
   subcutaneous spaces of adult goats for about 2 months. After extracting
   the molds with the tissue en-block and removing the plastic molds only,
   Biovalves with tri-leaflets similar to those of the native valves were
   constituted from completely autologous connective tissues and
   fibroblasts. Total 21 conduit-type Biovalves were implanted in the
   apico-aortic bypass or the pulmonary artery of goats, (8 and 13,
   respectively). No anticoagurants were used after implantation. Results:
   The valves were successfully implanted and showed smooth movement of the
   leaflets with a little regurgitation in angiogram, and the maximum
   duration reached to 3 years 7 months. Histological examination of the
   Biovalves showed the autologous cells covering the laminar surface of
   the valve leaflets as the endothelium and also migrating into the
   leaflet body to construct characteristic tissues like native leaflets.
   Discussion: The valves have a potential to be used for viable
   bioprosthetic valves and to keep better function and biocompatibility
   longer than current ones.
   Objectives: The main purpose of this study is to analyze the correlation
   between different types of dnDSA and AMR after renal transplantation.
   Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the patients after renal
   transplantation from January 2002 to March 2017 in our Center. A total
   of 47 patients with positive PRA and confirmed as dnDSA were included,
   which were grouped according to the DSA binding to C1q, C3d and subtypes
   of IgG. Patients were divided into AMR and non-AMR groups according to
   the pathology of graft biopsy. Results: The pre-transplantation dialysis
   time of the non-AMR group was longer than that of the AMR group in 47
   patients with dnDSA positive (35.4 +33.2 vs 9.8 +10.5, p=0.014).
   C1q-binding dnDSA had no significant effect on the graft survival after
   operation and biopsy. Among 47 patients with dnDSA positive, C3d-binding
   DSA group had lower graft survival time (p=0.009), higher HLA-DP
   mismatch (0.1 +/- 0.3, p=0.043) and higher percentage of pericapillary
   C4d deposition (p=0.042), with statistical significance. The graft
   survival rate of IgG3 subtype negative patients was higher than that of
   IgG3 subtype positive patients (p=0.003). Cox analysis found that the
   risk factors for graft survival included IgG3 (OR = 46.877, 95% CI =
   4.211-521.830, P = 0.002), HLA-DR mismatch (OR = 0.103, 95% CI =
   0.021-0.496, P = 0.005), proteinuriuria at biopsy (OR = 2.097, 95% CI =
   1.184-3.713, p=0.024) and creatinine at biopsy (OR = 1.004, 95% CI =
   1.001-1.007, P = 1.007) Discussion: Single-center study showed that
   there was no significant correlation between the incidence of AMR and
   different types of DSA. The accurate HLA-DR typing should be emphasized
   during transplantation. The monitoring of specific types of dnDSA will
   help us to take interventions and thus contribute to the survival of
   transplanted kidneys.
   Objectives: Rotary blood pumps (RBPs) are successfully used in high-risk
   treatments, but clot formation still threatens their long-term
   application. To reduce the risk of clot formation, in-vitro
   thrombogenicity testing could help to improve RBP design, as several
   studies have shown. Those studies were able to simulate in-vitro clot
   formation in RBPs, but they had limitations regarding a proper
   quantification of their thrombotic impact. In this study, we assessed if
   thromboelastometric analyses (TEM) are feasible to quantify the
   thrombotic impact of RBPs in-vitro. Methods: Five RBPs (n = 5) were
   placed into simple pump circuits that were built of silicone tubes and
   reservoirs. Each circuit was filled with 150 ml of slightly heparinized
   porcine blood (one donor pig per circuit) and the pumps were brought
   into operation. The pumps operated until a drastic drop in volume flow
   indicated thrombus formation. We carefully cleaned the RBPs from blood
   and documented any found thrombus. Prior to this, blood samples were
   taken at certain time points during pump operation. The blood samples
   were then analyzed by TEM. Results: TEM measurements showed a decrease
   in clotting time (CT) over the duration of the test, which indicates an
   ongoing increase in the activation of the coagulation system caused by
   the pump. Correspondingly, RBPs revealed visible blood clots at
   high-risk thrombus formation spots. Discussion: The decrease in CT over
   time corresponding to clot formation in the RBPs shows that TEM is able
   to detect and quantify the thrombotic impact of RBPs in-vitro. Thus, TEM
   could be used in future studies to compare the thrombogenicity of
   different RBPs by performing comparison tests similar to hemolysis
   testing. This could lead towards a standardization of in-vitro
   thrombogenicity testing of RBPs.
   Objectives: Cryopreservation of tissue-engineered constructs (TECs) is
   very important to provide such ready-to-use products for regenerative
   medicine and clinical application upon demand. Although cryopreservation
   of isolated cells seems to be well established, there are still a number
   of challenges associated with the cryopreservation of native and
   artificial tissues due to adherent cell state, limited heat and mass
   transfer as well as inadequate cryopreservation protocols. Here, we aim
   at developing an approach for efficient cryopreservation of electrospun
   TECs based on multipotent stromal cells (MSCs). Methods: Blend
   electrospun fibre mats (fibre diameter 0.8 +/- 0.2 mu m, thickness 100
   +/- 10 mu m) were produced from polycaprolactone and polylactic acid
   (PCL-PLA, ratio 100:50) using electrospinning. The fibre mats (diameter
   16 mm) were UV sterilised and seeded with MSCs (5x104 cells/cm2). The
   cells were cultivated on fibre mats for 7 days under static conditions
   and then frozen using 1 K/min cooling rate in a controlled rate freezer
   with different formulations of cryoprotective agents (CPAs), such as
   dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and its combination with sucrose (with and
   without pre-culture with sucrose for 24 h). The viability of cells
   growing on fibre mats was monitored for 2 weeks after seeding and 24 h
   after thawing. Results: The results indicate that PCL-PLA fibre mats are
   biocompatible with MSCs (viability higher than 82%). Pre-culture with
   sucrose before freezing as well as its addition to DMSO-containing
   freezing medium significantly improved cell viability after thawing.
   Moreover, duration of equilibration of cell-seeded fibre mats with the
   CPAs before freezing affected cell viability post-thaw. Discussion: We
   showed that it is feasible to effectively cryopreserve electrospun TECs
   using controlled technological steps. This work could serve as a solid
   background for further development of efficient cryopreservation methods
   for biobanking of electrospun constructs for vascular or corneal tissue
   engineering.
   Objectives: There have been discussions on effects of pleural effusion
   on the breathing muscles dynamics. In particular, hemidiaphragm
   inversion influence on the pleural pressure (PPL) and ventilation
   parameters has not been precisely determined. The aim of this study was
   to analyze changes in PPL and ventilation parameters in patients
   undergoing therapeutic thoracentesis (TT). Particular attention has been
   paid to inversion of the hemidiaphragm caused by large one-sided pleural
   effusion. The analysis was based on virtual experiments performed on an
   artificial cardio-respiratory patient (AP). Methods: TT was simulated on
   AP, which consists of several cooperating models of the respiratory
   system mechanics, gas transport and exchange, and circulation. Three
   scenarios were considered: a) proper work of the diaphragm, b)
   flattening and fixation of the hemidiaphragm due to the large amount of
   fluid, c) paradoxical excursion of the inverted hemidiaphragm. Results:
   Simulations showed that during progressive pleural fluid withdrawal
   significant changes in the course of PPL were observed, particularly in
   scenarios b and c. Paradoxical excursion of the inverted hemidiaphragm
   significantly influenced the alveolar oxygen partial pressure (PAO2) due
   to a kind of pendelluft: e.g., air flows out from the corresponding lung
   during inspiration and thus it flows to the lung in the hemithorax
   without pleural effusion. Discussion: Flattening and inversion of the
   hemidiaphragm have an influence on several physiological factors of
   which PPL and PAO2 seem to be the most important. Hence, TT may improve
   pulmonary system function particularly in patients with inverted
   hemidiaphragm.
   Objectives: Bone loss at implantation sites on oral cavities is a major
   problem for dental surgeons; in order to combat this issue, we developed
   3 types of colagen biomaterial blends: chondrohitin sulfate, carbon
   nanotubes, and electric stimulated. Methods: Bovine colagen type I was
   dissoluted at 4% in formic acid 0,1M (Synth - Brazil) and divided in 4
   groups: A- with Chondroitin Sulphate (Sigma Aldrich); B - carbon
   nanotubes suspention (Sigma Aldrich); C- eletric field ; D - control
   group. All of the samples were crosslinked with NHS
   (N-hydroxysuccinimide esters) (Thermo Scientific-USA) and freeze dried
   at a LH2000 equipment (Terroni - Brazil). The samples were analized by:
   SEM; EDS; XPS; Bartha respirometry and FET. Results: All of the samples
   have the same macroscopic morphology. The SEM of the group submitted to
   electric field shows organization of the colagen fibers. The EDS shows
   atomic content of carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen with other substances
   Discussion: The absence of contaminants within the samples and the
   increase in stiffness exhibit the compatibility of this material for use
   in bone augmentation in implantology. The material is shown to be not
   toxic, however more tests should be conducted prior to human use.
   Objectives: The optimization of the long term storage of cells and
   tissues is a challenging process with many variables but one factor is
   often overlooked: the freezing device itself. There are freezing
   containers that have to be placed in a -80 degrees C freezer and the
   manufacturer promises a cooling rate of 1 K/min. On the other hand there
   are controlled rate freezers where cooling rates from 0.1 K/min up to 50
   K/min are promised. In this study we compared two commercially available
   freezing containers and four controlled rate freezers with respect to
   their functioning principle. Furthermore, we investigated the accuracy
   of the adjusted cooling rate and the nucleation temperature of the
   samples. Methods: Seven 1.5 ml cryovials filled with 1 ml 0.9% (w/v)
   sodium chloride solution were dispersed evenly over the rack of each
   freezing device. Constantan thermocouples (type T) connected to a RedLab
   device were placed in the middle of the solution of each cryovial to
   record temperatures every second with the respective software. The
   cooling rates were calculated from the melting point (-0.6 degrees C) of
   the solution to -30 degrees C with n=3. For all freezing devices a
   cooling rate of 1 K/min was set according to the manufacturers
   guidelines. Results: The freezing containers had sample cooling rates
   between 0.5 and 0.8 K/min. All controlled rate freezers showed cooling
   rates similar to the programmed cooling rate of 1 K/min. Higher cooling
   rates resulted in increasing deviations between programmed and measured
   cooling rates. The nucleation temperatures of the samples in the
   freezing containers were mainly between 0 degrees C and -6 degrees C.
   However, the controlled rate freezers showed nucleation temperatures
   mainly in the range of -6 degrees C to -12 degrees C. Discussion:
   Varying definitions from each manufacturer resulted in the observed
   cooling rate differences of the freezing containers. Limited heat
   transfer accounted for the increased cooling rate deviation recorded in
   higher programmed cooling rates.
   Objectives: Patients using ventricular assist devices (VADs) still
   suffer from adverse events such as pump malfunctions or thromboembolic
   events. This can be caused by thrombi that have formed inside the pump
   (pump thrombus). Therefore, there is a great need to prevent such
   adverse events through engineering measures in the early development
   stage of blood pumps. Currently, a numerical model to predict thrombus
   sites inside VADs is still missing and the risk can only be assessed
   with in vitro experiments in the late development stage. A recently
   found model for thrombus formation at high shear rates that was derived
   from simple stenosis experiments promises great potential in the
   application in computational simulations (CFD) of VADs. Methods: In this
   study, advanced high resolution URANS simulations of rotational blood
   pumps were conducted with the flow solver of StarCCM+ (Siemens) at an
   operating point of 5L/min at 75 mmHg. A k- omega SST turbulence model
   and the sliding mesh method was applied. The existing model for
   predicting high shear thrombus formation was applied and compared with
   observations from explanted pumps. Based on these results a modification
   of that model is proposed that suggests a wall normal transport due to
   the change of shear rate in flow direction. This modification was
   realized in the CFD by applying a correlation between the computed
   direction of the pressure gradient and the flow direction. Results: The
   application of the model shows that thrombus sites are overpredicted in
   rotational blood pumps when compared with experimental results or
   observations from explanted pumps. However, with a modification of the
   model which proposes that the influence is a wall normal transport due
   to a change in shear rate, a good agreement was found. Discussion: Since
   there is little data available in the literature that shows the position
   of pump thrombi the validity of these models remains unclear and has to
   be experimentally evaluated further.
   Objectives: Cryptogenic stroke is the cause of 40% of ischaemic acute
   cerebrovascular events. Study aim was to evaluate the recurrence of
   ischaemic cerebrovascular events in patients successfully treated by
   percutaneous closure of patent foramen ovale (PFO). Methods: From
   February 2004 to January 2019, 314 symptomatic (243 stroke, 71 TIA)
   patients, (153 M 161 F; mean age 41 yrs, range 10-69) underwent
   percutaneous closure of PFO. 151 patients/314 (48%) had concomitant
   migraine, 90 (60%) with aura. 7 different occluder devices were
   implanted by transesophageal echocardiography, for a total of 317
   implants. During follow-up all patients underwent clinical (Rankin
   modified scale) and quality of life (SF36) evaluations, transcranial
   Doppler (TCD), trans-thoracic echocardiography, and MRI. Cerebral and
   angio-MR assessed the degree of lesions by quantitative and qualitative
   comparative analysis performed before and after treatment. Sizes of
   lesions were measured by manual segmentation on the axial, coronal and
   sagittal images acquired. Results: Successful device deployment was
   achieved in 99% of pateints; patients were discharged home within 3
   days. Follow-up was 100% complete (median 55.4, range 1-178 months). At
   6 months, Rankin scale was 0 (p<0.0001) in 230 patients (95%) affected
   by stroke and 10 patients reached score 1. Quality of life improved
   significantly (P<0.0001). In 101/151 patients (67%) with migraine,
   intensity and frequency of attacks significantly decreased (P<0.0001).
   TCD showed residual microembolic signals in 10 patients, 3 patients
   required secondary successful treatment for an associate defect. TTE
   (after 1, 3, 6, 12 months and once a year for 5 years) showed optimal
   sealing of all devices without signs of erosion, incomplete closure and
   thrombus. In 265 patients cerebral MRI showed no new lesions at 2 years.
   Discussion: Our 15 year experience suggests that percutaneous treatment
   of PFO is safe and beneficial for secondary prevention of recurrence of
   acute cerebrovascular events irrespective of the device used.
   Objectives: Endovascular stent grafting is the standard treatment for
   patients with acute traumatic aortic rupture with extensive associated
   lesions. Very little long term information is available in large series.
   Methods: From March 1999 to September 2018, 83 patients (72 M and 11 F;
   mean age: 37.25 +/- 13.46;range 16 to 69) admitted with acute or chronic
   traumatic aortic lesions underwent endovascular repair. 60 cases had
   acute traumatic aortic rupture, due to road accidents in 69 patients and
   accidental falls in 3 patients. All procedures were carried out in the
   angiography suite. Left subclavian artery was always identified.
   Patients were followed-up in the out-patient clinic and by yearly angio
   CT-scan with regard to survival and complications. The follow-up was
   100% complete. Results: Endovascular stent-graft treatment was
   successful in all cases of acute or chronic aortic injury. No
   post-operative paraplegia occurred. Control angiography showed optimal
   sealing and complete exclusion of the pseudo-aneurysm from blood flow
   with no primary endoleak. Patients underwent treatment of all associated
   lesions later on during hospital stay. Two patients died in the
   hospital: 1 patient of cerebral haemorrhage and 1 patient of sepsis.
   During the follow-up 5 patients died (survival: 91.4%) for causes
   unrelated to the aortic procedure. no cases of perigraft leakage or
   aortic disruption were detected. During follow-up 1 patient had a steal
   syndrome and 1 patient paraplegia due to the covering of the left
   subclavian artery by endovascular graft. 4 years after treatment 1
   patient had inner thrombosis of the graft developing a gradient; a new
   endovascular stent graft was deployed successfully. Freedom from
   complications was 92.3%. Discussion: The outcomes over 20 years of
   follow-up proves that endovascular stent graft repair is the first
   choice treatment in patients with traumatic aortic injuries. Our
   experience demonstrates the feasibility and safety of endovascular
   treatment including patients with extensive associated injuries.
   Objectives: In vitro simulation of an in vivo environment for human stem
   cell research is crucial for any kind of biomedical purpose. While
   important factors like 3D-cultivation and physiological oxygen
   concentrations gain more attention in the scientific community, we still
   lack reliable methods to visualize the hypoxic response of cells in 2D
   and 3D in vitro systems. In this study we present human adipose-derived
   MSCs, modified with a genetically encoded hypoxia-sensor. Methods: We
   used a lentiviral system to stably integrate the genetic construct into
   the chromosomal DNA of mesenchymal stem cells. To investigate the
   features of this novel biosensor we cultivated our cells in a 2D- and
   3D-environment under various oxygen levels and evaluated the outset of
   biosensor-fluorescence via microscopy and flow cytometry. Results: The
   hypoxia sensor was successfully integrated in mesenchymal stem cells and
   could easily be induced by cultivating the cells in a hypoxic condition.
   MSCs, modified with hypoxia biosensors could be cultivated up to passage
   20. Trilineage differentiation of MSCs (adipogenous, osteogenous and
   chondrogenouse differentiation) was also preserved by the cells after
   transfection. Using these cells we could monitor which 3D-cultivation
   conditions lead to hypoxic response of MSCs. Discussion: Our findings
   can help to improve our understanding of the influence of cultivation
   conditions on in situ oxygen concentrations. Moreover, by choosing the
   right 3D cultivation system, MSC can be cultivated in vitro under
   physiological hypoxic conditions.
   Objectives: Heart failure with reduced Ejection Fraction (HFrEF) is a
   progressive disease with a low 5-year survival of <50%, which affects 23
   million people worldwide. It is characterized by adverse remodeling of
   the left ventricle (dilated cardiomyopathy) due to an increase in
   filling pressures and myocardial wall stress. Pharmacological treatment
   and cardiac resynchronisation therapy have proven beneficial for
   survival. For patients with end-stage heart failure, a heart transplant
   or Left Ventricular Assist Device can be considered. A shortage of
   donors, patient selection and major downsides such as invasiveness and
   driveline infections limit the use of these treatments. Research has
   shown a 13% decrease in mortality for every 5% increase in left
   ventricular ejection fraction. Therefore, we developed a smart memory
   alloy configuration in order to increase the ejection fraction and
   obtain an increase of 3,5% in a bench model. To cope with ongoing left
   ventricular dilatation and rise in wall stress, this should be combined
   with adjustable and measurable ventricular restraint therapy. Our first
   aim is to measure local wall stress during a full cardiac cycle. Next,
   we aim to develop a mathematical model of the left ventricle to
   characterize the left ventricle in HFrEF patients. Methods: We will
   characterize in vivo wall stresses during the full cardiac cycle using
   Transesophageal Echocardiography and a left ventricular pressure
   catheter in 10 patients undergoing cardiac surgery for heart failure.
   With these parameters, we will develop a simplified mathematical model
   of the left ventricle and we will improve our bench model for
   experimental testing. Results: This research will provide a
   characterization of the weakened left ventricular wall and the
   determination of optimal smart material properties and configuration of
   the cardiac assist device. Discussion: With this information, a
   patient-specific HFrEF treatment device will be developed combining
   active cardiac support and restraint therapy.
   Objectives: Clinical data on the hemocompatibility of membranes used in
   double filtration lipoprotein apheresis (LP) is virtually unavailable.
   The present trial compared the hemocompatibility of a recently
   introduced polyethersulfone (PES) based plasma fractionator membrane,
   FractioPES (R) 200, to an ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer (EVAL)
   membrane during LP. Methods: In a prospective, randomized, controlled,
   crossover trial, eight patients on routine LP were subjected to one
   treatment with PES plasma (0.6 m(2), 3M PlasCure (R) 0.6) and
   fractionation (1.9 m(2), 3M SelectiCure (R) H19) membranes and one
   control treatment using a set of EVAL membranes (0.5 m(2), Asahi
   Plasmaflo OP-05W; 2.0 m(2), Asahi Cascadeflo EC-50W). Intraindividual
   treatment conditions were kept identical. At defined times, samples were
   drawn at different sites of the extracorporeal blood and plasma circuit
   to measure white blood cell (WBC) and platelet (PC) counts, complement
   factor C5a and thrombin-anti-thrombin III (ATIII). Results: With a nadir
   at 25 min, WBC in EVAL decreased to 34 % of baseline vs. 64 % at 20 min
   in PES (P<0.001). PC only marginally decreased over time with both
   membrane types. Maximum C5a in venous blood was 30.0 +/- 11.2 mu g/L at
   30 min with EVAL and 14.0 +/- 12.8 mu g/L at 25 min with PES (P<0.001).
   Compared to PES (23.3 +/- 15.2 at 5 min and 16.9 +/- 12.3 at 20 min,
   resp.), highest C5a concentrations were found in plasma after the EVAL
   plasma (56.1 +/- 22.0 mu g/L at 10 min; P<0.001) and fractionation
   filters (50.6 +/- 19.4 mu g/L at 30 min; P<0.001). ATIII levels did not
   rise until the end of the treatment without differences between
   membranes. Regarding Lp(a), LDL and HDL removal, both membrane sets
   performed equally (PES, 69.8 +/- 5.7, 64.9 +/- 8.8, and 17.4 +/- 13.6 %,
   resp., vs. EVAL, 69.5 +/- 6.0, 65.2 +/- 6.9, and 18.2 +/- 7.3 %, resp.).
   Discussion: Compared to EVAL, PES membranes are more beneficial with
   respect to the classical hemocompatibility of extracorporeal treatment
   procedures, namely leukocyte and complement system activation.
   Objectives: Mechanical circulatory support (MCS) has become a standard
   therapy for adult end-stage heart failure patients. For pediatric
   patients, technological development lags behind with no currently
   approved implantable rotary blood pump. As an alternative, the HeartWare
   HVAD, originally designed for adults, is increasingly used in pediatric
   patients. The aim of this multicenter study was to assess in-silico,
   in-vitro and in-vivo the blood trauma potential of this pump in
   pediatric application. Methods: Blood trauma potential of the HVAD was
   investigated in-silico and in-vitro at an adult and pediatric operating
   point (5L/min and 2.5L/min at 2800rpm and 2200rpm, respectively). The
   flow was simulated by computational fluid dynamics and analyzed
   regarding flow structures, shear stresses and washout. Hemolysis was
   assessed with pumps circulating bovine blood in a temperate flow
   circuit. Clinical outcome and indicators for in-vivo blood trauma were
   investigated retrospectively in 14 pediatric HVAD patients (age 11.3 +/-
   4.8years). Results: In the pediatric conditions, simulations predicted
   elevated mechanical stress profile below 50mPa, more stagnant flow
   field, with longer washout times within the pump. In-vitro measurements
   revealed an increased normalized index of hemolysis (NIH = 17.5 mg/100L
   vs. 8.2 mg/100L, (p=0.0021)). In the retrospective in vivo analysis, LDH
   and D-Dimer values were 1.5 and 3-fold elevated, respectively, compared
   to adult HVAD patients. Major bleedings were observed in 42.9%,
   suspected pump thrombosis and neurologic dysfunction in 14.3% of all
   patients. Discussion: The HVAD, operated at lower speeds and flows,
   induces elevated blood trauma. These results highlight the need for
   specifically adapted ventricular assist devices, optimized for the
   pediatric population. Further studies are required to assess the
   clinical implications of these findings.
   Objectives: Native arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is the preferred vascular
   access for hemodialysis, but it still has high rate of failure due to
   stenosis formation. Convincing evidence supports a key role of local
   hemodynamics in vascular remodeling, suggesting that disturbed flow
   conditions may be related to stenosis development. The purpose of our
   investigation was to explore the feasibility of coupling non-contrast
   enhanced MRI and high-resolution computational fluid dynamics (HR-CFD)
   to relate morphological vessel changes to local hemodynamics in AVF over
   time. Methods: We acquired non-contrast enhanced 3D fast spin echo MRI
   (CUBE T1) at 1 and 6 weeks, 6 months and 1 year after radio-cephalic AVF
   creation in one patient. We generated 3D models and evaluated lumen
   cross-sectional area changes over time. We perfomed CFD simulations
   using pimpleFoam solver of OpenFoam, prescribing blood flow waveforms
   derived by Ultrasound examination. We computed the 2 components of the
   wall shear stress vector over time, namely WSSdir, the component in the
   mean direction of the WSS vector and WSStr, the transversal component.
   Results: We observed a dilatation of the vein until 6 months, with a
   more pronounced increase in the venous outflow as compared to the
   juxta-anastomotic vein (JAV). The increase in vein's diameter was then
   followed by a narrowing of JAV at 1 year after AVF surgery. We found
   high-frequency fluctuations both for WSSdir and WSStr components, in
   different locations of the vein, at 6 weeks and 6 months after AVF
   creation. Oscillations of both components damped at 1 year after AVF
   creation, as a result of vessel remodeling. Discussion: Optimized CUBE
   T1, coupled with HR-CFD, allowed a characterization of morphological and
   hemodynamic changes over time. Our MRI-to-CFD pipeline represents a
   promising approach to elucidate mechanisms of local vascular remodeling
   and can be used for clinical investigations aimed at identifying
   critical hemodynamic factors responsible for AVF failure.
   Objectives: For 30 years, the mortality rate of patients hospitalized in
   intensive care unit has been drastically reduced. But an increase in
   muscle dysfunctions at the end of intensive care stay, leading to long
   term functional disability was observed at the same time. The
   physiological mechanism remains poorly understood due to a lack of study
   tools. The objective of this work is therefore to create a new tool for
   the tissue construction of an in vitro skeletal muscle. This tool should
   allow a muscle construction which mimics physiological reality, in order
   to model the disease more accurately. Also, it should allow mechanical
   and electrical stimulation in order to simulate the resumption of muscle
   contraction of patients. Methods: Using sol-gel process, we synthesized
   a new biomaterial, based on an epoxy organic-inorganic hybrid precursor
   (g-glycidyloxypropyltrimethoxysilane). This biomaterial was deposited as
   a thin layer (spin-coating process) of 7 mu m thickness on a silicone
   membrane suitable to undergo mechanical stretching. The biomaterial was
   microstructured using the UV laser writing lithography to create a line
   network. This line network was revealed with a 2-minute isopropanol bath
   and we obtained lines of 8 mu m thickness spaced of 175 mu m. To ensure
   a biological environment and a strong adhesion of cells on
   microstructured silicone support during mechanical stretching, we
   grafted silylated bioactive peptides using dip-coating process. Results:
   Muscular stem cells which were isolated from patients' quadriceps biopsy
   were seemed and, by immunofluorescence staining, we observed a growth of
   muscle fibers along the lines, mimicking the physiological organization
   of a muscle. Discussion: We were able to model the first stages of a
   complex muscle organoid in vitro using a new tool manufactured by a
   fast, simple and reproducible process. With the mechanical and
   electrical stimulation of this muscle-on-a-chip, this work should allow
   us to better understand these muscle dysfunctions and find new
   treatments.
   Objectives: Cryopreservation of 'ready-to-use' tissue-engineered
   constructs (TECs) is a promising strategy which may facilitate their
   future clinical application. This is very challenging and ambitious task
   and therefore recent efforts have been focused on developing new
   cryopreservation strategies for long-term storage of TECs. This work
   covers some practical considerations for cryopreservation of cell-free
   and cell-seeded scaffolds vastly differing by structure and composition.
   Methods: The first test system includes 3D porous
   collagen-hydroxyapatite (HAP) scaffolds prepared by freeze-drying and
   coaxial alginate macrospheres prepared by electrospraying. Samples were
   frozen at 1 K/min either in a bulk DMSO solution (with and without
   sucrose) or after removal of residual solution. After thawing, we
   evaluated compression (collagen-HAP scaffolds) and rheological
   properties (coaxial alginate macrospheres) of cell-free systems.
   Viability of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) within both types of
   scaffolds was evaluated 24-h post-thaw using live-dead assay. The second
   test system comprises flat fiber mats (produced from
   polycaprolactone/polylactic acid using electrospinning) seeded with CHO
   cells. This system intends to develop plate electrodes for
   electroporation of attached cells with non-permeable cryoprotective
   agents (CPAs) such as sugars for future cryopreservation applications.
   Results: All scaffolds were cytocompatible with corresponding cell
   types. Freezing after removal of residual solution was superior to
   conventional freezing. Addition of sucrose increased cell viability
   (both scaffold types) and improved viscoelastic properties of coaxial
   macrospheres. Constructed plate electrodes provided good compromise
   between high cell permeabilisation and viability after electroporation
   with sucrose at 1.7 kV/cm electric field. Discussion: The findings
   suggest that it is feasible to cryopreserve cell-free and cell-seeded
   scaffolds using DMSO and sucrose. As a step further, there are high
   expectations associated with using electroporation as a mean for
   intracellular delivery of non-toxic CPAs towards DMSO-free
   cryopreservation of TECs.
   Objectives: Tailored Forming is a new manufacturing technology to
   manufacture solid components out of two or more different metals. The
   components are joined to a hybrid semi-finished workpiece. Afterwards, a
   forming process is performed to improve the materials properties. This
   allows creating hybrid metallic parts that are adjusted to their
   specific loads and their field of application in comparison to parts
   made out of monomaterials. The potential use case of Tailored
   Forming-parts is still being researched. Biomedical implants are a
   potential field of application. In the presented study, the contact
   mechanics of two potential concepts for Tailored Forming hip implants
   were analysed. Methods: Both concepts consist of a magnesium component
   that should be resorbed in the human body and leads to a better bone
   growth. A second component in the implants is used to absorb loads. In a
   numerical analysis the two implants were compared to a conventional
   implant. For the potential evaluation two load cases "walking" and
   "walking upstairs" were considered. Results: While one concept leads to
   higher stresses in the implant, the other concept shows almost similar
   stress distributions as the conventional implant and has the additional
   advantage of the better bone growth due to the magnesium component.
   Discussion: Based on this work further research on different implant
   concepts has to be made to give a clear statement about the potential of
   Tailored Forming-Implants.
   Objectives: In consideration of the recently published implant files,
   testing of medical devices has gained signifigant importance. Many
   medical implants are subject to normative testing during their
   regulatory approval process, such as stents, heart valves and blood
   pumps. No testing norm or standard, however, exists for regulatory
   approval of left atrial appendage occlusion devices. Therefore, this
   study aimed to establish in-vitro bench tests for LAA occlusion (LAAo)
   devices and compares the clinically most widely used devices. Methods:
   Seven different LAA occlusion systems with device diameter ranging
   between 22 and 34 mm were tested regarding tug force and radial force
   resulting in a total of 24 devices. Radial force was assessed in a
   commercially available tester whereas tug force was evaluated in a novel
   in-vitro test setup consisting of bovine tissue. Results: Significant
   differences in the mechanical properties of the different devices were
   observed. Radial force ranged between 8.6 N at maximum compression for
   the LAmbre 2228 device and 0.1 N for the Occlutech 27 mm implant at
   minimum compression. A similar variability of mechanical properties was
   seen in the tug test results. Values ranged from 4.6 N to 0.4 N for the
   Wavecrest 22 mm and the Occlutech 24 mm device, respectively, at maximum
   and minimum compression. Discussion: Large variations in mechanical
   properties were seen between the different devices. The study showed
   that device stability is more dependent on anchoring structures, such as
   hooks and barbs, than on radial force. A strong positive correlation
   between the number of anchoring structures per millimeter circumference
   of an occluder and its tug force was found (r=0.87, p < 0.01). The large
   variations in mechanical properties aggravate comparison of current LAA
   occlusion devices which underlines the need for standardized preclinical
   testing to prompt clinical compatibility.
   Objectives: Pump thrombosis is a severe adverse event in ventricular
   assist devices. Current therapy often involves an exchange of the entire
   pump. Alternative solutions must be explored to reduce surgery numbers.
   A protocol for in vitro lysis of LVAD specific thrombus with alteplase
   was established in this study. Methods: A fluid chamber of silicone
   tubing was filled with isotonic sodium chloride solution. An artificial
   human thrombus was suspended within. Alteplase was added to the system
   according to the maximum dose for clinical use, 0.028 mg/ml. Five
   experiments each were conducted for stasis and fibrin thrombi
   respectively. Both types were lysis tested for four and 24 hours each.
   Fluid samples and photographs were taken for dissolution evaluation.
   Results: Visual inspection of the fibrin thrombus showed clear
   dissolution. For the stasis thrombus, the 24 h experiment produced no
   discernible dissolution of the thrombi, while the thrombi investigated
   over the 4 h period fragmented into small pieces which did not dissolve
   entirely. D-dimer levels in the fibrin thrombus tests rose steadily
   through the alteplase treatment for both test durations (short test
   12800-25600 ng/ml, long test 25600-51200 ng/ml). For the short term
   stasis thrombus testing, D-dimer values rose similarly to the fibrin
   thrombus, but levels remained much lower (short test 1600-3200 ng/ml,
   long test >200 ng/ml). Long term stasis thrombus tests showed no
   significant rise in D-dimer levels. Discussion: Alteplase was successful
   in dissolving fibrin thrombi in our experimental setup. D-dimer analysis
   supported the visual impression. The fragmentation of stasis thrombi and
   D-dimer levels measured may be due to the drug's fibrinolytic effect.
   The amount of erythrocytes in a stasis thrombus may resist lysis and
   produce challenges in the clinical application of thrombus lysis
   treatment. With this setup we were able to examine the reaction of the
   LVAD thrombi to Alteplase. This information can be used to further
   optimise clinical lysis therapy.
   Objectives: Methylprednisolon pulse therapy was used in the initial
   phase of induction therapy in some patients. This study was conducted in
   order to examine the short and long term effect of methylprednisolone
   pulse therapy for the lupus nephritis treated with muti-target therapy.
   Methods: The retrospective study included 43 patients diagnosed with
   lupus nephritis receiving muti-target therapy in our center, including
   prednisone combined with MMF and tacrolimus. 19 patients received
   methylprednisolon pulse therapy in the initial phase of induction
   therapy, 24 patients only received prednisone combined with MMF and
   tacrolimus. The dose of methylprednisolonpulse therapy was intravenous
   injection 500mgx3 days and the following prednisone dose was
   0.8-1.0mg/kg. We compared the primary and secondary outcomes of the two
   groups. In the patients combined with acute renal injury (AKI) subgroup,
   we also compared the primary and secondary outcomes between the two
   groups. Results: In the primary outcome, the CR rates are similar
   between the two groups. We did not find significant difference in the
   total remission rate (either complete or partial) between the two groups
   (p=0.93). The same is true for the remission time (p=0.87). There was no
   significant difference in the time and number of patients entering
   hemodialysis between the two groups (p=0.65). Although, in the AKI
   subgroup, there was a significant difference in the serum creatinine
   between the two groups in 1 month (P=0.045). However, there was no
   significant difference in the following up, and the probability of
   achieving CR and replase (calculated by using the Kaplan - Meier method)
   also had no significant difference. Discussion: Methylprednisolon pulse
   therapy seemed to have no significant effect on the long-term prognosis
   of lupus nephritis treated with muti-target therapy and it could not
   delay the patients' entry into hemodialysis. However, it may have had a
   better effect on the recovery of AKI patients and rapid relief of
   inflammatory reactions.
   Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate intradialytic on-line
   multicomponent total removed solutes (TRS) monitoring in the spent
   dialysate, as potentially more objective parameter for removal of uremic
   solute markers urea, indoxyl sulfate (IS), and beta 2-Microglobulin
   (B2M) compared to relative indices as removal ratio, using a novel
   miniaturized optical sensor during hemodialysis (HD) and
   hemodiafiltration (HDF) with different settings. Methods: Ten ESKD
   patients (6 M and 4 F, 60.2 +/- 16.8 yrs) on chronic HDF were followed
   during 5 midweek dialysis sessions each (length 240min, HD: N=1,
   Qb=200ml/min, Qd=300ml/min, FX60; HDF: N=4, Qb > 300ml/min, Qd >
   500ml/min, Vsubst > 15l, FX800 and FX1000). Spent dialysate from the
   drain was monitored on-line by a miniaturized sensor prototype
   (Optofluid Technologies Ou, Estonia). For total dialysate collection
   method as the reference, a spent dialysate sample from the tank at the
   end of each dialysis session was taken. The concentrations of urea and
   B2M were determined in the clinical laboratory. Concentration of IS was
   determined utilizing the HPLC. Based on differences between laboratory
   and optical sensor TRS values BIAS and standard error (SE) were
   calculated. A t-test was used to determine significant differences (P <=
   0.05). Results: The average TRS values of optical sensor and laboratory
   were 510 +/- 86mM/L and 485 +/- 106mM/L for urea, 224 +/- 41mg/L and 228
   +/- 47mg/L for B2M, and 732 +/- 371 mu M/L and 719 +/- 392 mu M/L for
   IS, respectively. No statistical differences were found between optical
   and laboratory TRS values for any uremic solute. The relative BIAS +/-
   SE values of the TRS were -7.99 +/- 19.43% for urea, 0.07 +/- 15.60% for
   B2M, and -4.72 +/- 13.25% for IS, respectively. Discussion: Novel
   miniaturized optical sensor successfully carried out intradialytic
   on-line multicomponent TRS monitoring in the spent dialysate.
   Objectives: Perioperative tight glycemic control (TGC) and management is
   of paramount importance during perioperative treatment of patients with
   multiorgan failure. Recent results have shown that such interoperative
   TGC led to an improvement of morbidity and mortality and to a prevention
   of Surgical site infection (SSI) in ICU patients. Consequently, a
   user-friendly device combining glucose analysis and delivery of glucose
   and insulin should allow for better therapies. Methods: Based on an
   already existing artificial pancreas device (STG-22), a new artificial
   endocrine pancreas system (STG-55) was developed. With a battery
   incorporated, it uses again a closed loop analytical system. Due to its
   in-built sensors, the closed-loop system allows for a quick and easy
   feed-back analysis of patient data through already established
   algorithms for glucose and insulin infusion. With the help of a
   disposable modular tubing circuit blood sampling from the patient's vein
   is realized and assessed by an automatically calibrated sensor. The
   device exhibits a maneuverable weight of only 36 kg and can be set-up
   within a single hour. Results: Clinical trials with STG-55, in Japan
   (Kochi University Hospital) have proven its re not sign liable
   practicability. Glucose monitoring was stable and results comparable to
   the analyses of an independent glucose analyzer with a high correlation
   coefficient. Due to appropriate insulin administration, no hypoglycemia
   was observed in patients under investigation. Discussion: The advent of
   new technological tools, such as miniaturized analytical devices in
   combination with the application of patient-specific precise algorithms
   allows for a strict and successful therapy without hypoglycemia in
   perioperative patients. With the new design and concept of STG-55, the
   set-up time for the artificial pancreas can be reduced down to 30% of
   preexisting devices, which finally makes a glucose and insulin
   management in both the interoperative and the ICU user friendly.
   The generation of complex cellular structures for human application
   often requires a matrix, defining the three-dimensional shape and
   mechanical properties of the artificial tissue. The matrix as such is
   not viable. If this matrix is of human origin, Directive 2004/23/EC (in
   its national version) shall apply. In that case only "non-substantial"
   processing methods may be utilized, which are specified in Regulation
   1294/2007/EC. For example, non-cellular substances can be extracted from
   the tissue, so-called derivatives. These derivatives, if of human
   origin, are also tissues within the meaning of Directive 2004/23/EC. If
   these derivatives are further processed, or if the tissue originates
   from animals, the matrix is classified as a medical device. The Human
   Tissue Authority describes the delimitation as follows: "Derivatives of
   non-viable tissues and cells such collagen fillers (i.e. collagen
   extracted from tissues and cells) fall under the Medical Device
   Regulation (MDR). Non-viable tissue and cell products such as
   demineralized bone matrix, or acellular human tissues or tissue
   matrices, will not be covered by the MDR. They will continue to fall
   under the Directive 2004/23/EC." The paper deals in more detail with the
   problem of demarcation and describes the consequences of this in
   practice. We will discuss the problem of demarcation in more detail as
   well as describe the consequences in practical implementation.
   Objectives: In this study, two attempts of new biomaterial development
   based on the latest results of cell biology and tissue engineering are
   reported. One is specific cell separation using DNA as linker, and
   another is novel hybrid materials constructed by decellularized tissues
   complexed with synthetic polymer. Methods: Antibody was immobilized via
   desthiobiotin-avidin interaction. Single strand DNA (20mer) was
   chemically immobilized on the surface and then antibody (anti-mouse
   CD45, mCD45) modified with the complementary single strand DNA was
   immobilized on the surface through DNA duplex formation. Decellularized
   porcine dermis was prepared and lyophilized. After that, methyl
   methacrylate (MMA) monomer were immersed in stages, then polymerization
   was proceeded. The obtained hybrid material was analyzed by tensile
   strength and SEM observation. Results: Cells were also adhered on the
   surface at 37 degrees C and detached by 4 degrees C incubation with
   remaining cells that interacted with the surface via antibody-antigen
   interaction. The adhered cells were released by DNase treatment. These
   results suggest that cells can be selectively captured and collected by
   using the surface that immobilizes an antibody via dissociation
   molecules. The monomer absorption depends strongly on the tissue
   structure. Gradient-type decellularized dermis-poly(methyl methacrylate)
   complex was prepared by controlling the permeation time of the methyl
   methacrylate monomer. The mechanical strength of this complex gradually
   increased from the dermis side to the polymer side. Discussion:
   Developing new biomaterials combining new knowledge among different
   science discipline is an indispensable methodology for the next
   generation of medical development. The materials presented here are
   example of these biomaterials, and show the direction of future
   biomaterial development.
   Objectives: This investigation discusses the method of electrical
   stimulation of human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC)
   and skin fibroblasts (FB) growing on substrates composed by carbon
   nanotubes and organic compounds. Methods: Substrates were produced from
   a water dispersion of single-walled carbon nanotubes and organic
   compounds (serum albumin, collagen, chitosan) and formed by evaporation
   of the liquid component using infrared laser radiation. Laser exposure
   stimulated the formation of conductive nanotube clusters responsible for
   electrical signal transmission to the cells, and organic compounds
   improved cell adhesion due to the presence of cell membrane receptors
   sensitive to matrix proteins and aminosugar molecules. An aseptic system
   for electrical cell stimulation included an electric pulse generator,
   culture plate with cells with a breadboard and electrodes made of
   surgical steel with gold plating. Cells were stimulated for 48 hours
   with pulsed electric signal (60-200 mV amplitude, 1 ms pulse duration, 1
   s pause) directly inside the CO2-incubator. Results: The effects of
   electrical stimulation on the cell proliferation were estimated by
   MTT-test. It was found that both MSC and FB are sensitive to the
   stimulus, but the most prominent increase of cell proliferation was
   detected at 80 mV pulse amplitude. In these conditions, a 13 and 16
   percent augmentation of cell growth rate was obtained for MSC and FB,
   respectively. Similar results (the formation of denser cell monolayer)
   were achieved by fluorescent microscopy of cell nuclei stained by
   ethidium bromide and fluorescein diacetate. No pathological changes in
   cell morphology were observed. Discussion: The obtained results suggest
   that MSC and FB growing on conductive substrates are sensitive to
   electrical stimulation. This observation can be explained by the
   activation of potential-controlled ion channels and the stimulation of
   metabolic processes that accelerate cell growth.
   Objectives: The Modular Extracorporeal Lung Assist System (ModELAS) is a
   highly compact, modular, fully integrated pump-lung. The device can be
   configured to provide adult low-flow extracorporeal CO2 removal (ECCO2R)
   (removal of 30-50% of metabolic CO2), full adult respiratory support or
   full pediatric respiratory support. The modular design allows for the
   exchange of the 0.65 m(2) adult bundle and the 0.3 m(2) pediatric
   bundle, while all other device components are identical. These studies
   characterized the in vivo performance of the ModELAS for each
   application. Methods: In vivo device performance was evaluated in
   healthy sheep (n=4 7-day ECCO2R, n=6 30-day adult ECMO, n=3 7-day
   pediatric ECMO). Pediatric studies utilized a right atrium to pulmonary
   artery cannulation strategy while adult studies utilized a dual lumen
   cannula placed in the jugular vein. Animals were recovered and tethered
   within a pen. The target blood flow rate was 0.5 L/min for ECCO2R and
   2-3 L/min for the ECMO applications. Anticoagulation was achieved via
   continuous heparin infusion. Animal hemodynamics were measured hourly,
   and blood chemistry, gas transfer and plasma free hemoglobin (PfHb) were
   measured throughout each study. Results: All animals were recovered and
   9 animals completed the full study duration. Average CO2 removal during
   ECCO2R was 74 +/- 6 mL/min. Average adult and pediatric oxygenation was
   134 +/- 10 mL/min and 94 +/- 11 mL/min, respectively. Average PfHb was
   less than 25 mg/dL, with the exception of one study following an acute
   kidney injury. Early terminations were due to a pulmonary embolism, a
   hemothorax, an intra-bundle thrombus and a fractured cannula. Typical
   explanted devices exhibited minimal thrombus. When present, thrombi were
   primarily located at the bundle inlet surface and impeller pivot.
   Discussion: These studies are on-going, but demonstrate positive
   performance of the ModELAS across a clinically relevant respiratory
   support spectrum.
   Objectives: Various modes of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation with or
   without a pump have been used as a bridge to lung transplantation in
   clinical settings. We have started to develop a large animal model for
   testing newly developed artificial lungs that can be used as a long-term
   bridging device. Methods: A total of eight goats weighing 40-55 kg were
   used. A membrane lung (Capiox EBS (R), Terumo, Tokyo, Japan) accompanied
   by a centrifugal pump (Emersave (R), Terumo, Tokyo, Japan) was connected
   to the pulmonary artery (PA) trunk for outflow, and the left atrial (LA)
   appendage for inflow. The PA pressure (PAP), systemic arterial pressure
   (AP), pre- and post-oxygenator pressures were monitored. The blood flow
   of the main PA and the membrane lung were monitored continuously by
   using an ultrasonic perivascular probe (Transonic Systems Inc., Ithaca,
   NY). The blood flow to the membrane lung was maintained at around 2.0
   L/min during the trials. Results: Four out of eight goats did not
   survive because of initial surgical failures (N=2), and introducing air
   bubbles in the membrane lungs (N=2). Other four goats were successfully
   kept for device testing. Durations of the circuit run were 7, 16, 24,
   and 48 days with or without heparin infusions according to the
   experimental protocols. Mean AP and mean PAP at the recovery from the
   surgery were 81 +/- 16 mmHg and 19 +/- 2 mmHg, respectively. The PA flow
   rate was 4.4 +/- 0.5 L/min. Discussion: The animal model for testing
   long-term membrane lung application as PA-to-LA configuration has been
   established. The model makes it possible for us to assess artificial
   lungs in vivo setting for long-term with stable blood flow through the
   device.
   Objectives: The effectiveness of the inhaled drugs is strictly related
   to the areas which are reachable by the drug particles. Unless the
   particles reach the desired part of the bronchial tree, their influence
   might not meet the required expectations and consequently the disease
   progress might not be stopped. Therefore, the primary objective of this
   research was to analyze the airflow patterns and particles deposition of
   a standard inhaled drug, commonly used during the treatment of asthma,
   with the use of computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The study was
   devoted to the analysis of the particles diameter influence on their
   deposition areas within the entire respiratory tract. Methods: Two
   patient-specific respiratory tract models, for 6 and 12-year-old
   patients, were reconstructed basing on the DICOM image sets obtained
   during the Computed Tomography Examinations. The reconstruction of the
   digital models was performed within the Mimics Research 20.0 program,
   whereas the meshes were prepared with the use of the Ansys ICEM package.
   Numerical analyses were carried out as stationary ones with the constant
   inflow of the particles of various diameters (within the range of
   1.0-50.0 mu m). Results: It was proven that depending on the particles
   size, their deposition within the respiratory tract varies
   significantly. The vast majority of the particles with diameters over 20
   mu m are gathered on the walls of the throat, whereas particles of
   diameters 5-15 mu m are accumulating mainly on the trachea walls,
   leaving the alveoli insufficiently supplied with the drug particles.
   Similar phenomena could be observed for both investigated cases of the
   reconstructed geometries. Discussion: The significant changes of the
   drug particle distribution resulting from the various diameters of the
   particles indicate that the inhaled drug size cannot be treated as
   negligible factor during the drug spraying. Improper distribution of the
   particles, i.e. their aggregation on the wall of the throat and trachea,
   might not inhibit the symptoms of the asthma.
   Objectives: The improvement of immunosuppressive strategies have
   signifigantly reduced the risk and mortality of cellular rejection after
   Heart Transplantation (HTx). Recently, Humoral Rejection and antibodies
   have been recognized as a major problem in the management of recipients
   during the follow-up. Methods: 23 patients out of more than 700
   recipients undergoing HTx and 6 undergoing retransplantation required
   techniques of apheretic medicine to manage Humoral Rejection episodes or
   to lead to transplant patients with Donor Specific Antibodies (DSA).
   Results: In our experience 4 patients were treated with photopheresis
   with excellent tolerability, no adverse event and no rejection episodes.
   Photopheresis was added on top of standard immunosuppressive therapy in
   patients requiring minimization of calcineurins due to other clinical
   conditions. 19 patients experiencing humoral rejection were treated
   alternatively with Plasma Exchange (8 patients) or with
   immunoadsorption. Plasma Exchange was preferred in acute patients
   requiring removal of inflammatory factors other than antibodies while
   Immunoabsorption was better tolerated and adopted to reduce the
   metabolic impact and coagulative disorders when the patient was more
   stable. Discussion: Apheretic Medicine has opened a new door and
   represents an efficient weapon in the armamentarium of an HTx center.
   The complexity of the management of this new diseased in frail patients
   highlights the need for a multidisciplinary group establishing the right
   treatment for every patient.
   Realheart TAH is designed to imitate the construction of the human heart
   in order to create a blood flow as natural as possible. Realheart TAH
   consists of two pumps, corresponding to the right and left side of the
   natural heart. It pumps blood from the left side and right side
   simultaneously in a synchronized manner. Each pump of the Realheart TAH
   consists of an atrium and a ventricle, with a valve cylinder in between.
   When the valve cylinder moves towards ventricle, the blood pumps out
   from the ventricle creating the systolic phase. The ventricle fills with
   blood when the valve cylinder moves towards the atrium creating a
   diastolic phase. The cardiac output of the Realheart TAH depends on the
   stroke length of the valve cylinder and the frequency of the movement.
   The left and right pump regulate cardiac output independently in order
   to coordinate the left/right flow balance of the circulatory system.
   Similar to natural heart, Realheart TAH is integrated into the
   circulatory system, which facilitates the uninterrupted blood flow to
   the atrium, when it pumps the blood out of the ventricle in pulses. The
   atrium is constructed with a compliance membrane to avoid blood suction
   from the veins during the systolic phase.
   Objectives: Pre-vascularized, fibrin-based implants that can be attached
   to the blood vessels in vivo are a promising solution to faster and more
   efficient vascularization of implants, to facilitate implant healing and
   survival. Here, low concentrated (up to 10mg/mL) fibrin hydrogels have
   been shown to promote tube formation of endothelial cells in co-culture
   with ASC. However, these fibrin hydrogels are fairly unstable and higher
   fibrin concentrations are necessary for implant fabrication. We
   investigated whether higher concentrated (20-40 mg/mL) fibrin hydrogels
   were suitable for tube formation and if perfusion of the hydrogels could
   support capillarization of a fibrin-based implant. Methods: Capillary
   formation of endothelial cells was tested in tube assays using fibrin
   concentrations of 1-30 mg/ml. Hydrogels were fabricated with
   cryoprecipitated fibrinogen from blood plasma that had been activated
   with thrombin. Gels were seeded with EC and ASC co-cultures, supplied
   with feeding medium containing pro-angiogenic factors, and cultivated
   for 7 days. Hydrogels with 40 mg/mL fibrin and pre-formed channels were
   cellularized with EC and ASC and perfused with feeding medium for 10
   days under continuous flow. Results: In tube assays, only concentrations
   of 1 mg/mL and 5 mg/mL fibrin were suitable for endothelial tube
   formation, which started after 2 days and peaked after 5 days in
   culture. Tubes were stable for the total assay duration of 7 days.
   However, under perfusion, fibrin gels of 40 mg/mL showed an
   endothelialized pore formation throughout the gel. Discussion:
   High-concentration fibrin hydrogels can successfully be capillarized by
   EC-ASC co-cultures and perfusion. In static conditions, only
   low-concentration fibrin hydrogels are suitable for tube formation. As
   the next step hydrogels of different concentrations are to be connected
   to fibrin vascular grafts and perfused as a whole implant construct
   using a custom-made flow chamber as mechanical support.
   Objectives: The aim of the study was to analyze the effect of the
   passage number and glucose concentration on viability of the human
   umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) cultured in the culture flasks.
   Methods: The HUVEC were isolated from umbilical veins obtained by
   Caesarean section. Cells after the 2nd and 7th passage were seeded with
   density of 4,600 cells/cm2. Glucose concentration in the culture medium
   was kept constant at the normal (5 mM) or high (20 mM) level or was
   switched every 24 hours from normal to high level or vice versa for 7 or
   14 days. The cell viability, mitochondrial membrane potential (Delta psi
   m) and activity of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) were analyzed using
   the flow cytometry (with propidium iodide, JC1 and DCFDA test,
   respectively). The glucose uptake and lactate production was also
   monitored. Microscopic visualization of cells was made after fixation in
   formalin using hematoxylin and eosin staining. Results: After 7 days of
   culturing in medium with normal, high and variable glucose concentration
   the cell viability was higher respectively by 5%, 4% and 4% in the HUVEC
   passaged 7 times than in those passaged 2 times. After 14 days the
   differences were higher and equal to 21%, 21% and 31%, respectively.
   After 7 days Delta psi m was higher 1.3, 3.2 and 2.6 times in HUVEC
   after 7th passage than those after 2nd one, which were cultured in
   medium with the normal, high and variable glucose level, respectively.
   The glucose uptake and the lactate production were higher after 14 days
   and similar for all passages. The ROS activity was lower after 14 days
   of culturing for all cultures. Microscopic visualization of cells did
   not show any morphological differences. Discussion: The obtained results
   show that the properties and phenotype of HUVEC after the second passage
   are closer to the properties and phenotype of native cells. The HUVEC
   after the 7th passage are better adapted to in vitro conditions
   deviating from physiological conditions.
   One of the pillars for a more patient oriented healthcare is found in
   patient individualised medicine. Custom-made implants tailored to the
   individual's specific requirements is one of the key elements herein to
   obtain better outcomes. However, the production of patient
   individualised implants is nowadays still often related to a high rate
   of manual processes, causing both high cost and long delivery periods.
   Technical innovations play a crucial role in introducing these patient
   individualised therapy options into clinical prac-tice. Advances in
   medical imaging and the evolution of new production technologies (e.g.
   additive manufacturing) build the basis for a time and cost effective
   production of implants of lot size one at industrial-scale level.
   Combining these aspects with digitalisation leads to the potential of a
   new era of patient individualised implants and appropriate business
   models. It is crucial to systematically review and adapt the data
   management and data processing throughout the entire value chain in
   order to achieve the goal of a more patient individualised care.
   Different tools are used to de-fine interfaces, actors, data types
   throughout the entire process and methods need to be established for the
   data pro-cessing itself. A digital process chain from diagnosis to the
   actual delivery of a custom-made implant to the hospital including the
   manufacturing process is established. The underlying principles and
   assumptions used are exemplarily shown. The digital process chain is
   used to pave the way from science into a successful business model and
   company, in order to introduce these patient individualised implants to
   achieve a better patient care. The use of technical and medical
   progresses in combination with digitalisation is used to obtain a new
   generation of patient individualised implants. The way from science to
   start-up within this field is presented.
   Objectives: There are currently no available noninvasive methods that
   allow for the simultaneous and reliable measure of cardiac output (CO)
   and pulse wave velocity (PWV) in the arterial tree. Both of those
   indices are important biomarkers of cardiovascular status. Methods:
   Radial pressure profiles were recorded using applanation tonometry in a
   group of healthy subjects (N=18) and hemodialysis patients (N=30).
   Recorded pulse waves were used to estimate patient-specific parameters
   of the mathematical model describing the blood flow in the system of 55
   major arteries. Calibration of the model with patient data allowed to
   calculate patient-specific CO and PWV between any two points in the
   arterial tree. In all of the patients and healthy subjects we performed
   additional measurements of PWV using ECG gated applanation tonometry at
   two arterial sites (SphygmoCor, AtCor Medical) and CO using bioimpedance
   cardiography (PhysioFlow, Manatec Biomedical). Results: The model was
   able to reproduce all of the recorded pressure profiles with high
   accuracy (average relative error < 10%). Model-estimated PWV highly
   correlated with the one measured using SphygmoCor device (R = 0.75,
   p-value < 0.001). Model-predicted CO also correlated with the one
   measured by the bioimpedance cardiography, but at a lower level (R =
   0.52, p-value <0.001). Discussion: Our study demonstrates that coupling
   a mathematical model with a single peripheral pressure profile has the
   potential to provide information about cardiovascular state that was
   previously only available when using more complicated methods.
   Objectives: The purpose of this work is the study of biocompatibility
   for samples of three-dimensional cellular and tissue engineering
   constructions for layer-by-layer repair of tissues of heart and blood
   vessels. Samples components are albumin, collagen and chitosan as
   matrices and carbon nanotubes as reinforcement. Three-dimensional
   structures are formed in layers by laser printing. Methods: The
   biocompatibility of the samples and layers of their components was
   evaluated after their incubation with endothelial cells for 72 hours.
   Cell morphology was assessed by fluorescence microscopy and quantitative
   analysis was performed using MTT-test and real-time cell analysis by
   means of electrical impedance monitoring. For in vivo studies, samples
   were implanted in breasts of laboratory birds. Results: It has been
   established that the layer consisting of albumin and nanotubes supports
   proliferation of cells the most. Moreover, all layers have surface
   properties that provide cell adhesion. Real-time cell analysis showed
   improved cell proliferation compared to control during the entire
   incubation time, however the greatest differences were observed after 25
   hours of incubation. The morphology of the cells on the samples
   corresponds to the morphology of the control cells. With implantation of
   samples in experimental animals, the absence of their toxicity was
   observed. Discussion: Samples of three-dimensional cellular and
   tissue-engineering structures are biocompatible because of
   characteristics of their components and suitable surface structure. The
   obtained samples can be used to repair damages in cardiovascular system.
   Due to the method of laser printing, samples can be made in any form,
   taking into account the features of the damaged area of tissues.
   Objectives: The blood flow rate is the only parameter that can be
   controlled during the operation of an intracorporeal membrane oxygenator
   that significantly influences the gas exchange rate. Due to anatomical
   size restrictions, the catheter is of limited size and the tight
   packaging does not allow for placement of a dedicated flow rate sensor.
   Therefore, for a flow rate control system, the correct estimation of the
   blood flow rate is essential. In this work, a system specific flow rate
   estimation method is presented based on motor current and motor speed
   measurements. Methods: A training data set of motor current - I and
   rotational speed - omega, as well as volumetric flow rate - Q were
   recorded in an in-vitro model of the intracorporeal membrane oxygenator.
   A 40/60 water/glycerol mixture was used to approximate the dynamic
   properties of blood. The rotational speed of the motor was varied in a
   range of 10000 to 30000 RPM. For each motor speed, the hydraulic
   resistance of the system was varied with a throttle resulting in
   different flow rate values. Additionally, a test data set was acquired
   consisting of different rotational speed, hydraulic resistance, and flow
   rate triplets. The I, omega and Q training data was used to construct a
   fitting surface of the type Q(I, omega) by a regularized cubic spline
   least-squares approximation method. The surface was defined in a grid of
   591x591 points with Imin=-70 mA, Imax=520 mA, omega min=500 RPM, omega
   max=30000 RPM. The test set of I - omega pairs was then used to predict
   Q by means of a nearest neighbor search in the modeled surface. Results:
   A correlation coefficient of r=0.96 was achieved between the estimated
   and measured flow rates of the water/glycerol mixture. Discussion: The
   strong correlation between estimated and measured flow rate suggests
   that sensorless flow rate control is possible.
   Objectives: Developing new bioinks that are able to meet the crucial
   requirements for 3D bioprinting of different tissues has emerged
   recently as an important topic in the field of biomaterials. In this
   work, linear chains of hyaluronic acid (HA) were hydrophobically
   modified using hexadecyl short chains. The rheological properties as
   well as the 3D printability were investigated. Methods: HA of Mw = 76.6
   kDa was hydrophobically modified by conjugation of parts of its primary
   hydroxyl groups with hexadecyl chains in two steps. The ratio of
   substitution was determined using 1HNMR spectroscopy. Two different
   hydrogels were prepared at polymer concentration of 0.4 and 1.6 wt%. The
   rheological properties of both hydrogels were investigated using
   continuous flow experiment and cyclic strain time sweep experiment.
   Furthermore, the 3D printability of the hydrogels was studied using an
   extrusion-based 3D printer. Results: 1H NMR spectrum of the new product
   revealed that the substitution ratio was 40 mol%. Furthermore, the
   modified polymer was able to form sable hydrogels at both polymer
   concentrations whereas unmodified HA was unable to form hydrogel at the
   same concentrations. The rheological experiments showed decreasing of
   hydrogels viscosity by increasing the shearing rate which points toward
   a shear thinning property. Both hydrogels showed sharp decreases in the
   storage moduli upon applying high strains. The hydrogel prepared using
   2.6 wt% of the modified polymer showed, however, higher shape-fidelity
   for 3D printing compared to hydrogel at polymer concentration of 0.4
   wt%. Discussion: Hydrophobic modification of HA using relatively short
   alkyl chains enables physical crosslinking between polymer chains to
   produce biocompatible and 3D-printable hydrogel using low concentration
   of modified polymer. The rheological properties suggest their
   suitability as ink for extrusion-based 3D bioprinting
   Objectives: High resolution imaging of living cells is impaired by
   artefacts introduced by chemical fixation and by the rapid movement of
   molecules during live cell imaging. We have therefore developed tools to
   cryo-arrest living cells on a microscope and image them by high- and
   super-resolution microscopy. However, the developed equipment is also
   applicable to investigate the process of cryopreservation. Methods: We
   have developed two different microscope cryo-stages that allow for
   continuous observation on the fluorescence microscope. One stage allows
   for relatively slow controlled cooling (<50 degrees C/min) and warming
   (<150 degrees C/min) of cells. It allows for medium exchange during
   cooling and warming and thus for change of concentration of
   cryoprotective agents. Due to the design of this microscope stage, oil
   immersion objectives can be used down to at least -45 degrees C. The
   second stage is designed to ultra-rapidly cool cells with >10000 degrees
   C/s to temperatures Results: We established a protocol to reversibly
   cryo-arrest living cells on a microscope stage. This permits to image
   physiological processes in the same living cells with practically
   unlimited acquisition time at consecutive points in time. This allowed
   for super-resolution imaging and microspectroscopy measurements, which
   were impeded at physiological temperatures, because of the dynamics of
   cellular molecules. The development of a device to ultra-rapidly
   cryo-arrest living cells on a microscope under continuous observation
   allowed for the investigation of cells, which have been
   cryo-arrested/vitrified within Discussion: The presented cryo-fixations
   methods enable a more precise measurement of molecular patterns and thus
   a better understanding of molecular organization in cells under
   physiological conditions. The developed microscopy stages should however
   also enable high- and super-resolution fluorescence imaging of molecular
   processes in cells during the process of cryopreservation.
   Objectives: The aim of this work is to provide a general overview of the
   design challenges in the wireless powering of artificial organs, to
   develop a general design strategy for inductive powering units (IPU),
   and to design a prototype IPU for mid-power application with high-stable
   output characteristic. Methods: Artificial organs can benefit greatly
   from inductive wireless powering, but there are several major design
   challenges which must be overcome. The high energy transfer efficiency
   must be ensured. The IPU must tolerate coils misalignments. Tissue
   overheating must be avoided. Biocompatible materials must be used. Size
   and weight restrictions must be taken into account. Finally, patient
   body specifics should be considered. We have developed a new general
   design strategy in which all mentioned problems are addressed. The main
   feature is that we simultaneously optimize the inductive link and the
   schematics of the transmitter and the receiver and take the body
   specific elements (the thickness of the skin and the fat layer) into
   account. We have developed strictly formal procedures which can be
   implemented using software in computer-aided design procedures. Results:
   In order to test and verify our approach we have designed a prototype
   IPU. The design goal was set as follows: IPU must ensure output power in
   the range 0.45 horizontal ellipsis 0.55 W for the axial distance between
   the coils in the range 10 horizontal ellipsis 20 mm and the lateral
   misalignments up to 20 mm. The design goal was achieved. Several coil
   couples were used to adjust optimal energy transfer distance to the
   expected implantation depth. Measurements were performed in the air as
   well as with the samples of "skin-fat" biological objects were
   performed. Discussion: We have developed and tested design strategy for
   biomedical IPU which can provide reliable design adjusted to the various
   requirements and the specific of the patient's body.
   Objectives: The HeartMate 3 (HM3, Abbott Laboratories, USA) and
   HeartWare HVAD (Medtronic Inc., USA) clinically revealed a significantly
   different thrombogenic profile. In detail, while the HM3 has abated
   incidence of pump thrombosis, it was not associated with reduced stroke
   incidence. We numerically characterized and compared prothrombotic flow
   characteristics of the two pumps to provide mechanistic insights into
   observed clinical outcomes. Methods: Computational fluid dynamics (CFD)
   simulations were performed to evaluate flow fields associated with
   periodic speed modulation in the two pumps (the artificial pulse for the
   HM3 and the Lavare cycle for the HVAD). One-way coupling to a lumped
   parameter model of the cardiovascular system was employed to account for
   physiologic boundary conditions. Results were compared to baseline
   simulations with constant pressure head and rotor speed to
   comprehensively evaluate geometrical and speed modulation effects.
   Analysis of the thrombogenic potential was based on calculation of: i) a
   specific platelet activation marker, the Platelet Activity State (PAS),
   using time course of viscous and Reynolds stress computed on platelet
   trajectories probed using Lagrangian particle tracking, ii) scalar
   washout, iii) volumes of flow stagnation, and iv) wall shear stress
   patterns. Results: The HM3 and HVAD showed different PAS distribution.
   Speed modulation was associated with increased sum of viscous and
   Reynolds stresses and PAS magnitude. Analysis of temporal and spatial
   gradients of the shear stress histories calculated on platelet
   trajectories, volumes of stagnation, and wall shear stresses allowed
   identification of geometrical and operating parameters that might
   contribute to pump thrombogenicity and pump washout Discussion: We
   compared prothrombotic fluid dynamic features of the HM3 and HVAD under
   realistic dynamic operating conditions. Our results provide a "numerical
   rationale" for the observed clinical outcomes.
   Objectives: Over time left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) have become
   an alternative to heart transplantation because of enormous technical
   development and miniaturization. Implantation of these systems has been
   proven to lead to considerably improved survival, with an increase in
   quality of life. Following implantation, most patients display a
   considerable improvement in physical capacity, measured according to the
   New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification, even though exercise
   tolerance levels following the implantation of an LVAD are still
   considerably restricted. Methods: Current state of scientific knowledge
   with respect to the physical capacity of patients with terminal heart
   failure after LVAD implantation is described at rest and during
   exercise. The significance of new diagnostic tools, such as the
   non-invasive inert gas rebreathing method for measurement of cardiac
   output and arteriovenous oxygen difference (AVDO2) in assessment of the
   performance of LVAD patients is discussed. Results: Pump flow across the
   LVAD can be increased to a certain degree during exercise and normal
   everyday activities via two mechanisms: exercise-dependent tachycardia
   and increase of enddiastolic pressure in the left ventricle in
   conjunction with increased preloading. The share of the native left
   ventricle in systemic perfusion can also increase during exercise. Here,
   left-ventricular pressure exceeds systemic blood pressure and the aortic
   valve opens. The contractile reserve of the myocardium does, of course,
   play a crucial role. Discussion: Ultimately, the cardiopulmonary
   capacity of LVAD patients is restricted to a higher degree during
   exercise, even after implantation. Larger studies are required to
   clarify the extent to which longer-term physical exercise training after
   discharge from rehabilitation and/or an increase in the number of pump
   rotations can lead to increased physical capacity in LVAD patients.
   Objectives: The epidemiology of heart failure (HF) is a rising medical
   burden with an estimated growing rate of 46% from 2012 to 2030. Left
   Ventricular Assist Devices (LVAD) and minimally invasive techniques are
   nowadays key therapies to guarantee optimal treatments for each HF
   patient. So far, clinical experience with minimally-invasive LVAD
   surgery showed promising short-term results. The aim of this study is to
   evaluate the long-term results of the first series of patients who
   received minimally-invasive LVAD surgery at our institution. Methods: We
   reviewed the short and long term outcomes of 111 end-stage HF patients
   who received an LVAD implantation (HVAD, HeartWare, Medtronic, USA) at
   our institution between 2011 and 2014. All patients underwent an upper
   hemisternotomy and left-sided anterolateral thoracotomy with
   cardiopulmonary bypass. Results: Between 2011 and 2014, 111
   minimally-invasive LVAD implantations were performed at our institution
   (78% male, 22% female; mean age 52 +/- 4; dilated cardiomyopathy 42.6%;
   ischaemic cardiomyopathy 44.4%, other aetiologies 13%). Postoperative
   bleeding incidence was 9.6% leading to a low amount of applied packed
   red blood cells (mean: 4.9 rbc), short ICU stay (mean 9.3 days), and a
   low incidence of right heart failure (4.6%). Thirty-day mortality was
   5.2%, 90-day mortality 9.0% and 1-year survival 88%. Long-term follow-up
   (median 6.4 years) demonstrated a mortality of 51,4%, a transplant rate
   of 16.4%, and an explant rate of 1,7%. 15.8% of patients underwent pump
   exchange and 30,3% of patients had still an ongoing LVAD therapy at the
   time of follow-up. Discussion: Minimally-invasive LVAD implantations are
   proven to be safe and associated with a lower perioperative complication
   and mortality rate. By using an upper hemisternotomy with an
   anterolateral thoracotomy, the intra-hospital outcomes showed promising
   results impacting also the long-term follow-up which presented an
   excellent percentage of ongoing LVAD therapies.
   Objectives: Quantitative phase microscopy (QPM) provides fast and
   label-free analysis of living cells by minimized interaction with the
   sample. The analysis of QPM images enables the determination of
   morphological cell parameters like cell thickness and elongation and
   facilitates single cell tracking for migration analysis. Methods: To
   demonstrate the potential of QPM in determining the metastatic potential
   of cells, we have developed a fully automated QPM system utilizing
   digital holographic microscopy (DHM) in an off-axis Mach-Zehnder
   configuration. Different pancreatic tumor cell lines, beating heart
   cells, white blood cells and in vitro toxicology models were analyzed
   for refraction index, cell volume, cell area, dry mass and cell
   morphology dependent processes. Results: The morphological analysis of
   the different cell lines via QPM in combination with image
   segmentation-based evaluation of the retrieved quantitative phase images
   showed that QPI could identify and quantify cell types and cellular
   processes by cell specific properties as cell proliferation, cell death,
   3D cell migration or cell height. E. g. cells with a high metastatic
   potential had a lower cell thickness and a higher elongation than cells
   with a low metastatic potential. Moreover, computer assisted tracking of
   single cells showed that highly metastatic cells covered a longer
   distance and had a higher motility compared to cells with a low
   metastatic potential. Also white blood cell types and disease or drug
   induced morphological blood cell alterations could be separated.
   Discussion: In summary, the multi-functional potential of QPM in various
   cell biological applications as cancer cell or stem cell research,
   toxicological and pharmacological screenings and cell quality control
   represents a promising new approach for a fast and label free
   phenotyping of different cell types and cellular processes. QPM meets
   the growing interest in label-free, optical techniques minimizing
   samples interaction.
   Objectives: Severe life-threatening thrombocytopenia may be caused by
   exceptionally wide range of clinical conditions. Currently, donor
   platelet (PLT) transfusion is the only efficient clinical approach to
   successfully treat thrombocytopenia. However, PLT transfusion is
   challenged by adverse immune responses and is limited the short shelf
   life of donated material. Previously, we showed the feasibility to
   generate iPSC-derived MKs in a large scale, which can be used as an
   alternative to conventional PLT transfusion. However, success of this
   perspective therapeutic approach requires efficient biobanking
   technologies that would allow long-term storage and accumulation of MKs
   in clinically sufficient amounts. In this study, we aimed at the
   development of an optimal biobanking strategies for the preservation of
   iPSC-derived MKs. Methods: Dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) and
   propane-1,2-diol (PD) were evaluated for their cryoprotective efficiency
   in iPSC-derived MKs. Comprehensive phenotypic characterization of MKs
   before and after cryopreservation was performed by fluorescence
   microscopy and flow cytometry. Capability of cryopreserved MKs to form
   proPLTs and release functional PLTs has been tested in vitro.
   Transfusion into animal model has been performed to evaluate capability
   of MKs to release PLTs in vivo. Results and Discussion: Application of
   developed cryopreservation procedures allowed recovery of over 80% of
   iPSC-derived MKs cryopreserved with Me2SO and PD. Recovered cell
   populations expressed typical MK markers, including CD41, CD61, and
   CD42a and showed high polyploidy. Moreover, cryopreserved MKs showed the
   capability to form proPLTs and release PLTs in vitro as well as in vivo
   after transfusion in animal model. Present findings propose efficient
   clinically relevant biobanking strategies necessary for progress in
   MK-based regenerative and replacement approaches.
   Objectives: Adverse events due to flow-induced blood damage remain a
   serious problem for blood pumps as cardiac support systems. The
   numerical prediction of blood damage via computational fluid dynamics
   (CFD) is a helpful tool for the design and optimization of reliable
   pumps. Blood damage prediction models primarily are based on the acting
   shear stresses, which are calculated by solving the Navier-Stokes
   equations on computational grids. The purpose of this paper is to
   analyze the influence of the spatial discretization and the associated
   discretization error on the shear stress calculation in a blood pump in
   comparison to other important flow quantities like the pressure head of
   the pump. Methods: CFD analysis using seven Unsteady Reynolds-Averaged
   Navier-Stokes (URANS) simulations were performed. Two simple stress
   calculation indicators were applied to estimate the influence of the
   discretization on the results using an approach to calculate numerical
   uncertainties, which indicates discretization errors. Results: For the
   finest grid with 19 million elements, numerical uncertainties up to 20 %
   for shear stresses were determined, while the pressure heads show
   smaller uncertainties with a maximum of 4.8 %. Discussion: No
   grid-independent solution for velocity gradient-dependent variables
   could be obtained on a grid size that is comparable to mesh sizes in
   state-of-the-art blood pump studies. It can be concluded that the grid
   size has a major influence on the shear stress calculation, and
   therefore the potential blood damage prediction, and that the
   quantification of this error should always be taken into account.
   Objectives: The piezoelectric effect of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)
   is a promising property to be considered when controlling the diffusion
   of ions through membranes. This study examines the impact of different
   solvents and their ratios on the piezoelectric beta-phase of PVDF and on
   the diffusion rates of fiber membranes. Methods: Fiber mats were
   polarized via electrospinning using 20w% PVDF solutions with solvent
   mixtures of dimethylformamide (DMF) or dimethylacetamide (DMAc) as first
   solvent and acetone or methyl acetate (MeOAc) as second solvent in
   different ratios. Conversion of non-polar alpha-phase into polar
   beta-phase was evaluated via Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy
   (FTIR). Diffusion experiments were performed by measuring changes in
   conductivity of deionized water (1.5 mu S/cm) for 150min under static
   and cyclic loading conditions. Results: Polymer solutions showed a
   non-Newtonian behavior. An increasing acetone ratio led to decreasing
   densities in PVDF solutions. Densities remained unchanged for all MeOAc
   ratios. FTIR results for MeOAc-solubilized PVDF fiber mats showed lower
   intensity of alpha-phase peaks at 762cm(-1) as compared to acetone
   solubilized ones. The intensity of the characteristic 840cm(-1) polar
   beta-phase peak rose with a higher ratio of the second solvent.
   Diffusion experiments with piezoelectric PVDF membranes (n=5) inhibited
   sodium chloride diffusion under static conditions (67 mu S/cm) while
   induction of the direct piezoelectric effect allowed for increased
   diffusion (533 mu S/cm). Discussion: Solvent properties and ratios
   influence the intrinsic properties of PVDF solutions for electrospinning
   and consequently affect beta-phase conversion. Especially, MeOAc in
   combination with DMF or DMAc has a positive effect on piezoelectric
   beta-phase conversion. With suitable process parameters, piezoelectric
   fiber mats can be produced for active filter membranes. Ongoing
   experiments aim to investigate their molecular weight cut-off
   properties.
   Objectives: A cochlear implant (CI) is an auditory neuroprosthesis used
   to restore hearing in deaf and profoundly deaf patients. It features an
   electrode array (EA) which needs to be inserted into the inner ear
   (cochlea) to enable electrical stimulation of the auditory nerve.
   Spatial proximity of the EA and the nerve fibers is considered
   beneficial. This requires a shape change of the initially straight EA to
   enclose the inner wall of the spiral-shaped inner ear after
   implantation. Thin wires made of Nitinol-a shape memory alloy (SMA)-are
   investigated regarding their applicability as embedded actuators to
   implement a shape change. Methods: Nitinol wires ( null 100 mu m) have
   been trained to a spiral shape which was derived from cross-sectional
   images of a human specimen as an exemplary adaption to a specific
   cochlea geometry. Ten different variations of thermomechanical
   processing were applied by the supplier (G.RAU GmbH & Co. KG) to tailor
   the shape memory effect to the application specific requirements. In
   order to determine the resulting transformation temperatures (AS, AF) a
   bend and free recovery (BFR) test suitable for curved wires was
   developed and utilized. Results: It is possible to design and fabricate
   spiral-shaped SMA wires which fit to a specific cochlea shape. The
   developed BFR test setup allows for measuring the thermomechanical
   properties of these actuators in an application oriented manner. This
   provides slightly higher but more realistic measures for AS and AF
   compared to differential scanning calorimetry. Discussion: A complete
   design, manufacturing and validation process for thin spiral shape
   memory wires could be established. The next step is to integrate these
   wires into an EA and perform BFR measurements again as it is known that
   external forces due to stiffness of the EA alter the transformation
   temperatures.
   Objectives: The purpose of the work is to develop a theoretical basis
   for determining the thickness of the laminar boundary layer in the nasal
   cavity during respiration. Methods: Methods for obtaining basic
   scientific and practical results are based on the general principles of
   theoretical physics and aerodynamics in order to determine the laminar
   boundary layer of air flow in the upper respiratory tract. Results:
   Using the aerodynamic approach to the study of respiratory and olfactory
   disorders revealed that the thickness of the laminar boundary layer
   decreases with decreasing equivalent diameter of the nasal cavity and
   with increasing Reynolds number, which characterizes the degree of
   turbulence in the air flow. Typical values of the thickness of the
   laminar boundary layer are in the range of 0.2-0.05 mm, depending on the
   mode of nasal breathing and the configuration of the nasal cavity. The
   data obtained characterizes the effect of airflow on the mucous membrane
   of the nasal cavity: if the heterogeneity of the mucosal surface extends
   beyond the boundary of the laminar boundary layer, then such portions of
   the nasal cavity are exposed to turbulent flow, which leads to
   overdrying. The size of the heterogeneities of the mucosa is determined
   by tomographic data during their processing at the sub-pixel level,
   which allows for the investigation of the effect of the intensity of the
   boundary elements of the walls of the nasal passages. Discussion: A
   model of the distribution of airflow velocities in the nasal cavity in
   the turbulent mode is proposed; it has a logarithmic or power profile
   cross section, and within the laminar boundary layer the air velocity
   increases linearly to almost the max value. The current air velocity in
   the cross sections amounted to 5-7 m/s. The feature of the developed
   method is transitioned to hydraulic diameter, which takes into account
   complex configuration of the nasal cavity, as well as an anatomically
   narrow area - the olfactory slit.
   Objectives: Bioengineering of elements of the musculo-skeletal system is
   rich in studies concerning bone reconstruction. Among them, the culture
   of cells on a osteogenic electrospun scaffold under dynamic conditions
   is an interesting option. However, one should also consider the
   reconstruction of tendon and muscle finally mimicking a continuum from
   bone to muscle. Methods: Poly-caprolactone (PCL) 10% was electrospun on
   a rotating collector whose velocity varied to get random or aligned
   nanofibers. Bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs) and C2C12 cells were
   respectively seeded on the materials. Mechanical or electrical stresses
   were applied to the biohybrid scaffolds to differentiate cells towards
   tendon's or muscle's phenotypes, in the absence any specific biochemical
   factors. Results: After 2 weeks of culture under dynamic stretching
   (1Hz, 4% strain for an hour followed by 11h of rest), BMSCs were found
   to align in the stretching direction, presented increased levels of
   tenomodulin and neosynthetized collagen, compared to static conditions.
   C2C12 differentiation until aligned myotubes stage was more difficult to
   achieve. We proposed to add a PEG microstructure to guide cell growth.
   Combined to electrical stimulation, it led to the cells fusion into very
   long myotubes hosting many nuclei, as expected. Discussion: In this
   study, we managed to grow two different types of cells and generate
   their differentiation towards tendon and muscle lineage, in the absence
   of any differentiation factors. The next step is to implement the
   co-culture on different areas of the same electrospun scaffold, to let
   the cells proliferate and study the events occurring at the junction.
   Objectives: Alarm fatigue is a safety and quality problem where exposure
   to high rates of clinical alarms results in desensitization leading to
   cognitive bias or slowed response to alarms. One reason for alarm
   fatigue is false pressure alarms during extracorporeal blood therapies.
   It is clear that current machine algorithms based on simple threshold
   monitoring must be replaced by intelligent algorithms that avoid any
   false positive alarm. Methods: Detailed analysis of arterial pressure,
   venous pressure, transmembrane pressure, ultrafiltration rate and
   relative blood volume during hemodialysis was performed using a patient
   data base. Main causes of pressure alarms were identified, analysed and
   replicated during simulated hemodialysis therapies with a FMC 4008
   hemodialysis device and a patient simulator. Results: Data analysis
   shows clear evidence that even slowly drifting adaptive baseline alarms
   which are currently in use lead to false positive alarms with a high
   probability during nearly every treatment. Pressure variations which are
   induced by local flow and blood viscosity changes can be identified
   reliably by use of algorithms based on pattern recognition. Pressure
   variations from patient movements and changes in blood pressure show a
   different pattern that can be used to distinguish between true alarm
   events and false positive events. Discussion: For 25 years, it has been
   known that alarm systems which monitor whether a threshold value is
   exceeded have a rate of false alarms of 77-99,5% depending on the
   physiologic parameter monitored (Wiklund et al., 1994). New adaptive
   algorithms based on pattern recognition principles help to combine both
   maximum patient safety and avoidance of false positive pressure alarms.
   Objectives: In vivo tissue engineered vascular tissues "Biotubes"
   constructed in the subcutaneous spaces of the recipients exhibited
   superior functions. However, since the formation of the vascular tissues
   depends on the recipient conditions, chemical pretreatments such as
   dehydration by ethanol (ET) or crosslinking by glutaraldehyde (GA) were
   attempted to improve their initial mechanical durability. Last year, we
   reported that ET and GA increased the burst pressure of the tissues and
   did not affect their suture retention strength. This year, we measured 3
   parameters of mechanical properties: ultimate tensile strength (UTS),
   ultimate strain (%) and Young's modulus. Methods: Tubular tissues (ID: 5
   mm) constructed in the subcutaneous tissues of beagle dogs (4 weeks,
   n=3) were separated to the 3 groups, raw tissue group with no treatments
   (RAW), that under dehydration with 70% ET (ET) for 10 min and
   crosslinking with 0.6% GA (GA) for 10 min. We measured 3 parameters
   shown above, by tissue ringlet pull test. Results: There were no
   significant differences in UTS (RAW: 3.765 +/- 0.662 MPa, ET: 4.330 +/-
   0.619 MPa, GA: 3.763 +/- 0.438 MPa, p=0.409) or ultimate strain (RAW:
   30.15 +/- 1.60 %, ET: 41.22 +/- 6.11 %, GA: 37.73 +/- 4.36 %, p=0.209)
   between the 3 groups. Young's modulus of ET group was significantly
   higher among the 3 groups (RAW: 5.41 +/- 1.16 MPa, ET: 12.28 +/- 2.55
   MPa, GA: 7.65 +/- 1.18 MPa, p= 0.0289). Discussion: Short period of
   chemical treatment using ET and GA might make it possible to control the
   mechanical properties of in vivo tissue engineered vascular tissues to
   produce the ideal grafts in mechanical aspects.
   Objectives: Stent graft development is one of the most important topics
   for countries with a large number of elderly people. However, very
   little research has been carried out using model circulation of the
   aortic dissection. Quantitative evaluation and development have been
   difficult, because there was no model. Methods: In this study, a fluid
   dynamical circuit model circulation simulating the left heart
   circulation of the dissecting aortic aneurysm was developed with a
   pulsatile blood pump. Various shapes of the inflow side and outflow side
   for the pseudo lumen were used in the experimental series. Furthermore,
   an animal model of the dissecting aneurysm was developed using a
   mechanical dissecting method and flow patterns of the animal aortas with
   the model dissecting aneurysm, after the ethical committee's approval.
   Flow and pressure pattern time series data was recorded in the digital
   recorder and a quantitative evaluation was carried out. Results: Flow of
   the true lumen and pseudo lumen was divided with a thin membrane.
   Various amounts of the flow and pressure was observed and recorded.
   Membrane of the dissecting aortic aneurysm was simulated with rubber
   sheet. After the insertion of the aortic stent, the shapes of the flow
   and pressure pattern were altered. Animal experiments to develop the
   dissecting aneurysm were difficult. Firstly the aorta of the goats was
   removed, and then the dissecting aneurysm was to be constructed by the
   detachment of the tunica media of the aortic wall. Flow pattern of the
   experimental Aorta was recorded. Discussion: Quantitative evaluation of
   the Aortic Stent expanding performance and pressure and flow pattern in
   the true and pseudo lumen had been observed in the mock circulation
   loop. Furthermore, animal model of the dissecting aorta will be useful
   material for the development of the stent graft in the near future.
   Objectives: The aim of this work is to investigate the performance of
   the RealHeart (TM)psi total artificial heart (TAH) with a hybrid cardiac
   simulator (HCS). Methods: The HCS, developed at the Nalecz Institute of
   Biocybernetics and Biomedical Engineering, is a computational-hydraulic
   model of the cardiovascular system. Four hydro-numerical interfaces
   reproduced the pressure/flow profiles of atria, pulmonary artery, and
   aorta hydraulically, while the rest of the circulation was numerical.
   The TAH was connected accordingly. The TAH is a pulsatile 4-chamber
   device whose left and right sides can operate independently, by changing
   pulse rate (PR) and stroke length (SL). The TAH was tested on the HCS at
   low/medium operating points: PR 60/80/100/120 bpm; SL 20/22/24/26 mm;
   systole duration ratio 0.4 of the TAH cycle. Systemic resistance was
   changed between 0.8 and 1.2 mmHg/(ml/s), pulmonary resistance was
   changed between 0.1 and 0.2 mmHg/(ml/s). Systemic and pulmonary
   compliances were set to 1.4 ml/mmHg. Results: The independent tuning of
   PR and SL permits fine regulation the TAH flow on the left and right
   sides. As an example, for a peripheral resistance of 1.0 mmHg/(ml/s) the
   flow ranged from 2.7 l/min (PR=60,SL=20mm) to 7.0 l/min
   (PS=120,SL=26mm). For the investigated PRs and SLs, power consumption on
   the left pump ranged between 1.3 and 10.0 Watts and on the right pump
   between 0.9 and 6.0 Watts. The TAH provides a pulsatile flow, whose
   waveform depends on the SL and systole duration. This induced a pressure
   pulsatility ranging from 10mmHg (PR=60,SL=20mm) to 38 mmHg
   (PR=120,SL=26mm) in both the aorta and pulmonary artery. Discussion: The
   HCS is a flexible test bench to evaluate the TAH performance in
   different hemodynamic conditions. The tuning of PR and SL on the left
   and right side of the TAH, independently, offers flexibility in
   regulating cardiac output and in managing the left/right flow balance.
   Power consumption is in the range suitable for clinical applications.
   Objectives: In case of chronic mechanical circulatory support, it is
   highly desirable to fully understand the interaction between the beating
   left ventricle and the VAD in order to potentially reduce adverse
   events. Thus, we took the VAD's perspective and investigated the flow
   inside a VAD in an advanced development status during the time course of
   a heartbeat. Methods: The study is conducted with computational fluid
   dynamics (CFD) applying realistic pressure boundary conditions for left
   ventricular and arterial pressure and the results are compared to
   results produced with an established, active mock circulation loop. Due
   to the high resolution in time and space and the use of sliding mesh
   interfaces, local flow phenomena during different phases of systole and
   diastole are unmasked. The effects of inertia in the pump and cannulae
   become evident, which are not modeled in more traditional VAD flow
   simulations with steady-state boundary conditions. Results: The results
   show that hysteresis effects due to inertia are quantitatively of high
   importance. The hysteresis curves of the VAD operational point obtained
   experimentally and numerically correlate well. Moreover, the results
   show that a VAD design for a highly pulsed flow can lead to a situation,
   where almost no remaining stagnation zones, as quantified with a
   numerical stagnation index, exist during a heartbeat. Discussion:
   Despite increased computational costs, highly resolved CFD simulations
   in time and space with realistic time-varying boundary conditions are a
   powerful tool to increase understanding of the interaction of the
   mechanically supported circulation and the device itself. This enabled a
   verification of a VAD design with low to almost non-existing flow
   stagnation at constant rotational speed. This finding correlates well
   with the fact that the VAD does not require any anticoagulation in
   chronic animal trial testing lasting weeks to months.
   Objectives: The friction properties for the contact between contact
   lenses and the eyelid are the focus of current research in order to
   optimize the wearing comfort. The tribological system consisting of
   contact lense, eyelid and tear fluid should be considered. Suitable
   measurement conditions must be used for the examinations. Methods: In
   this research the nano- and microtribological friction properties of
   hard and soft (hydrogel) contact lenses were investigated. The friction
   conditions were investigated by nano scratch test; moreover, a
   nanotribometer was used to evaluate the frictional properties during
   sliding on the lenses. Contact lens fluid was applied as lubricant for
   both cases. Results: The friction coefficients of hard contact lenses
   and hydrogel lenses were detected for a range of speeds and loads. It
   was possible to examine the differences of the both contact lenses in
   detail. For the nano scratch and friction tests, there is a dependency
   of speed and normal force. Discussion: In case of nano-scratch tests,
   the frictional properties were investigated wile ploughing. This case
   shows the elastic- and plastic material properties besides the friction.
   In the case of the frictional tests, the measuring tip slides without
   ploughing. Due to the lubrication conditions, the soft hydrogel lenses
   feature a much lower friction coefficient. In case of the hard contact
   lenses, the coefficient of friction is comparable to the nano scratch
   test, as there is no lubrication film between both measuring tips and
   the contact lens. For further work it is mandatory to work under
   standazdized measurement conditions.
   Objectives: Patients suffering from chronic kidney disease (CKD) show an
   increased cardiovascular mortality and morbidity mainly due to the
   accumulation of protein-bound uremic retention solutes. Dialysis
   therapies have been optimized for the removal of low-molecular weight
   water-soluble and unbound uremic retention solutes, but not for
   protein-bound uremic retention solutes. Therefore, there is a strong
   need to increase the portion of unbound fractions in order to increase
   the clearance for these uremic toxins. Methods: We developed dialysis
   techniques where the protein-bound uremic retention solutes are removed
   more efficiently under high ionic strength or high-frequent electric
   fields. The protein integrity of proteins and enzymatic activities were
   analysed. Results: The protein-bound fraction of phenylacetic acid,
   indoxyl sulfate and p-cresyl sulfate was significantly decreased by
   using high ionic strength or high-frequent electric fields Discussion:
   Although protein-bound uremic retention solutes have a major impact on
   the morbidity and mortality of CKD patients, the clearance of these
   solutes by conventional extracorporeal therapies is low until now. These
   uremic toxins bind to plasma proteins with a molecular weight greater
   than the cut-off of dialysis membranes and therefore conventional
   dialysis therapies do not sufficiently remove protein-bound uremic
   toxins. Disruption of association with protein and uremic solute is one
   possibility to significantly improve the removal of protein-bound uremic
   toxins. Therefore, we developed approaches for an increased release
   protein-bound uremic retention solutes from their protein-binding
   resulting in an increased clearance. Conclusion: Improvements of
   therapies for CKD patients are essential. Especial the consideration of
   removing hydrophobic protein-bound uremic toxins via new methods like
   application of high-electric fields or increased ionic strength is a
   further progress
   Objectives: Tissue decellularization is one of the novel techniques in
   tissue engineering and regenerative medicine for obtaining extracellular
   matrix, which doesn't preserve mechanical properties of native tissue.
   Modified by the extracellular matrix, silk fibroin scaffolds can combine
   high biocompatibility and suitable mechanical properties. Methods:
   Wistar rats were used as liver donors. Decellularization of liver tissue
   was performed by sequential incubation with three solutions of 0,1% SDS
   containing Triton X-100 in the following concentrations: 1%, 2% and 3%.
   Livers were ground in liquid nitrogen and a certain fraction of
   microparticles was separated by precipitation and centrifugation. Silk
   fibroin scaffolds were prepared by a casting method using water as a
   solvent. Microparticle suspension was blended with fibroin solution
   before film preparation. Scaffold structure was investigated by scanning
   probe nanotomography (SPM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The
   cytotoxicity of scaffolds, cell adhesion and proliferation were
   evaluated. Modified scaffolds were used as wound coatings in a
   full-thickness skin wound model. Results: Microparticles with a size
   less than 5 mu m were prepared from decellularized liver tissue.
   Modified silk fibroin scaffolds were obtained. Sinuous and rough
   topography of the obtained matrix was shown. The produced scaffolds did
   not show cytotoxic effect. The cells adhesion was significantly higher
   on scaffolds modified with decellularized liver tissue microparticles in
   comparison with non-modified scaffolds. Modified silk fibroin scaffolds
   promoted skin wound regeneration by 30% in comparison with non-modified
   scaffolds. Discussion: Regenerative potential of extracellular matrix as
   microparticles was shown. Decellularization of organs and tissues may be
   used in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine for increasing the
   biocompatibility of the artificial grafts.
   Hemodialysis is an important therapy for End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD)
   patients if a donor kidney is not available. During four hours of
   conventional therapy, three times a week, mainly small water-soluble
   toxins and a limited number of middle molecules are effectively removed
   from the patients' blood [1]. Besides, the therapy is non-continuous,
   causing large fluctuations in water balance and uremic waste, potassium
   and phosphate. Therefore, in recent years, many developments are
   focussed on longer treatment times, such as, nocturnal dialysis or
   application of a portable or wearable artificial kidney (PAK or WAK
   respectively). The continuous therapy outside the hospital requires
   application of membranes with long-term selectivity, fouling resistance
   and blood compatibility as well as demands reduced amount of water. In
   fact, for WAK, a small volume of spent dialysate should be continuously
   regenerated and reused. In this lecture, we will discuss all these
   important issues, including:
   Strategies for achieving endotoxin-free dialysate since the continuous
   recirculation of the dialysate for prolonged time demands additional
   efforts to avoid microbial contamination, without extra water
   consumption and without affecting the overall weight of the system.
   Strategies for achieving dialysate regeneration and especially urea
   removal since its daily molar production is higher than that of other
   waste solutes.
   Objectives: Ventricular assist devices are a commonly used therapy for
   end stage heart failure patients. Pump thrombosis is one of the most
   common problems in patients supported by an LVAD. Two types of thrombus
   can be distinguished: white thrombi and red thrombi. The only available
   option to combat a PT is a lysis therapy or a pump exchange. The
   objective of the presented study is to develop a relevant white pump
   thrombus model to promote development of these concepts. Methods: We
   developed an in vitro mock circulation system. The artificial blood
   circulation is provided by a HVAD. The HVAD pumps 80ml of human blood
   through the silicone loop. Parameters for inducing the white thrombus
   are high shear stress (4000 revolutions per minute), a rougher surface
   of the rotor, and an added activator of the intrinsic coagulation
   cascade. After two hours, the HVAD-system was checked for a white
   thrombus. Generated thrombi were stored for subsequent analysis
   (scanning electron microscopy and mechanical stability). Results:
   Thrombus generation was reproducible in number and geometry. After ten
   test runs, 23 thrombi were detected. All these generated thrombi had a
   minimal size of 12 mm(2). The developed thrombi are very similar in
   structure compared to white patient thrombi explanted in clinic. The
   scanning electron microscope showed a fibrin net on the surface of all
   tested thrombi (n=5). All tested thrombi samples (n=5) resist high
   strength (max. 1.029 MPa) in compression tests, which is typical for
   white PT. Discussion: The size of the thrombus should be increased for
   special investigational needs. A protocol was developed for reproducible
   and reliable production of white, shear induced thrombi for lysis
   therapy investigations. In addition, the similarity (biological
   structure, mechanical stability) to explanted patient thrombi was shown.
   However, additional analyses should be performed for further
   characterization of the artificial thrombi.
   Patient-specific anatomies can be reconstructed with a precision of
   approximately 0.5mm, using state of the art imaging modalities. This
   refers both to hard and soft tissues, hence with applications in
   clinical domains such as orthopedics, dentistry, cardiovascular surgery.
   Datamining techniques such as statistical shape modeling support the
   generation of biofidelic computer models. However, these models have to
   be fed with accurate data to reflect not only the geometry but also the
   material properties, the loading conditions and the interface between
   implants and bone in case of prosthetic reconstruction. The challenge is
   to optimize the interface between host tissue and implant in order to
   achieve maximum long-term functionality, but this optimization is also
   dependent on the optimization of the interfacing between the implant,
   the surgeon and the host tissue. Thus also the surgical technique will
   benefit from engineering support. Biomedical engineering is a key player
   to achieve this. A good geometric fit between implant and host tissue
   will ensure optimal initial stability. Patient-specific implants can
   ensure this stability, incorporating solid and porous structures where
   needed. Pre-operative computer assisted planning allows to optimize the
   surgical intervention, incorporating patient-specific biomechanical
   models to predict the functional outcome of the surgical intervention.
   And finally, in order to achieve that the pre-operative plan is
   accurately transferred into the surgical practice, computer assisted
   surgery enabled by e.g. navigation, robotics of patient-specific
   surgical instrumentation (guides and implants) can come into play. Key
   to all state of the art developments in computer assisted surgery is the
   engineering on anatomy, enabled by multifunctional softwares and 3D
   printing technologies. Biomechanical modeling allows for
   patient-specific outcome prediction after surgical interventions and
   should become a routine practice in patient treatment. Patient specific
   surgical instrumentation is able to assist in realising the plan with
   sub-millimeter precision. Finally, quantification of the uncertainties
   that are inherent to biomechanical modeling is an essential contribution
   to reliable patient-specific outcome prediction.
   Objectives: Hemodialysis (HD) is a lifesaving therapy in patients with
   end stage renal disease. Little is known about why life expectancy for
   these patients is reduced in Europe and USA as compared to Japan. The
   aim of this study was to evaluate the importance of the interdialytic
   weight gain (fluid retention in relation to estimated body weight in %,
   IDWG) in relation to the dialysis length (hours). Methods: 20
   hemodialysis patients performed besides their regular dialyses 1
   hemodialysis/week within the frame of the study during a 3 week period.
   The baseline values and the change during HD of NT-pro-BNP (ProBNP) and
   Troponin T (TnT) at 180 minutes and pentraxin 3 (PTX) at 30 and 180min
   were compared with the change in IDWG divided by the hours the patient
   performed the HD as a marker of speed of ultrafiltration. The PROOF
   formula used was: [100 x Weight gain between dialysis (kg)]/[estimated
   body dry weight (kg) x time of HD session (hours)]. Spearmans
   correlation analysis was used to adjust for eventual outliers. Results:
   There was a correlation between extent of removal of the IDWG/hours of
   HD: 1) the baseline values of ProBNP (rho=0.54, p<0.001), TnT (rho=0.37,
   p=0.004), PTX (rho=0.26, p=0.043) and 2) the change during HD at 30 min
   of PTX (rho=0.27, p=0.038) and at 180 minutes of ProBNP (rho=0.68,
   p<0.001) and TnT (rho=0.40, p=0.002). 3) a PROOF breakpoint < 0.63
   caused less release of ProBNP (p<0.001). Discussion: The increase in
   weight between dialyses should be related to the body weight. A larger
   IDWG gives worse conditions. An increased speed of fluid in relation to
   body weight removal causes a higher release of cardiac markers
   indicating a strain and damage to the heart by each HD in contrast to
   what would be expected. Patients should be advised to limit fluid intake
   in relation to their body weight and adjust the HD length.
   Objectives: Fish roe is a highly nutritional product with diverse
   beneficial effects for the human health. This work used sardine (Sardina
   pilchardus) roe to produce novel delivery systems presenting antioxidant
   and anti-inflammatory properties. Methods: Methyl-tert-butyl ether
   extraction method was used to obtain lipid- and water-soluble compound
   rich phases. The fatty acids profile was analyzed by GC/MS. The
   identification of the hydrophilic compounds was performed by LC-HRMS.
   Lipids were used to produce large unilamellar liposomes (LUVs). The
   hydration of the lipid film was performed with PBS or sardine
   roe-derived aqueous phase. LUVs were characterized by their size,
   surface potential and morphology. The cytotoxicity of the extracts was
   evaluated using L929 cells. Their antioxidant activity was evaluated
   against different radicals, and their anti-inflammatory activity was
   assessed in the presence of LPS-stimulated macrophages. Results: GC/MS
   analyses demonstrated the presence of several fatty acids, such as omega
   3 fatty acids. LC-HRMS analyses revealed the presence of numerous
   bioactive compounds (e.g. essential amino acids and gadusol). LUVs
   prepared with the aqueous phase presented a higher heterogeneity in
   terms of size than when they were prepared with buffer. Both LUVs
   formulations have a negative surface charge and a spherical shape. The
   extracts presented antioxidant activity against peroxyl, hydroxyl and
   nitric oxide radicals. Biological assays indicated that the extracts are
   cytocompatible for the lowest tested concentrations and that they can
   inhibit the production of proinflammatory cytokines, which reveals their
   anti-inflammatory effect. Discussion: Our sardine roe-derived delivery
   systems and compounds have both antioxidant and anti-inflammatory
   activities and thus they may be considered as a valid alternative for
   the treatment of inflammatory conditions.
   Objectives: Engineered skeletal muscle tissues in three-dimensional (3D)
   cell culture platforms that resemble the muscles complex native
   structure and organization can be used as in vitro models to study
   muscle physiology and metabolism. This project allows us to develop a
   new platform to model muscle diseases (such as myotonic dystrophy 1) in
   vitro in order to study its response to candidate therapeutics and to
   better understand disease mechanisms of pathogenesis. To this end, we
   monitor the secretion of disease-associated biomarker proteins and
   metabolites. Methods: Here, we present 3D skeletal muscle constructs,
   fabricated by encapsulating C2C12 cells and patient-derived
   transdifferentiated skin fibroblasts in a photocrosslinkable Gelatin
   Methacrylate and Carbolymethylcellulose Methacrylate (GelMA:CMCMA)
   hydrogel and cryogel scaffold. These scaffolds present a microgrooved
   topography that promotes cell alignment and differentiation. Electrical
   stimulation (ES) was then applied to the engineered tissues during cell
   culture to induce spontaneous contraction and maturation of the
   sarcomeres. Cell alignment differentiation, and the effect of ES were
   assessed by calculating the orientation angle and fusion index of
   immunostained myotubes expressing Myosin Heavy Chain (MHC). Results: We
   have obtained a new platform to study the evolution of congenital muscle
   diseases, specifically myotonic dystrophy 1 and evaluate the functional
   tissues by metabolic and gene expression analysis. Monitor the secretion
   of biomarkers proteins, metabolites, and the glycolysis pathway of
   muscle tissues for different drug candidates. Discussion: This platform
   has been tested with different drugs assays and represent a step toward
   the goal of producing in vitro drug testing systems for medical and
   pharmaceutical industry applications. Finally, such "muscle
   tissue-on-a-chip" devices can be fabricated using patient's own cells as
   a major step toward personalized medicine.
   Objectives: The aim of this work is the creation and research of
   properties of tissue-engineering structures by the method of laser
   structuring a nanocarbon framework in bioorganic matrices. Methods: For
   the formation of the framework fibers from single-walled carbon
   nanotubes were used. Aqueous dispersions of nanocarbon fibers and
   proteins of albumin, collagen and amino sugar of chitosan were used as
   the initial medium for printing tissue-engineering structures. Printing
   of structures was carried out using the laser device generating pulsed
   laser radiation. The radiation wavelength was 1064 nm (100 ns pulse
   duration, 100 kHz frequency). Laser radiation using the scanner system
   of the device was moved on the dispersion layer. A computer model
   regulated the trajectory of the movement of radiation. Results: We have
   demonstrated the effect of welding nanocarbon fibers into a framework
   under the action of laser irradiation. The functionalization of
   nanocarbon fibers by protein and amino sugar molecules were proven. It
   was found the diameter of nanocarbon fibers was increased by several
   tens of nanometers due to their wrapping with a bio-organic matrix.
   Tissue-engineering structures had a meshy frame. The mesh size was
   100x100 mu m. The electrical conductivity of the structures increased
   several times and amounted to 1 S/m with laser irradiation. The hardness
   of tissue-engineering structures was 150-370 MPa. The cytological
   compatibility of tissue-engineering structures with fibroblast cells and
   endothelial cells was tested. The density of proliferating cells on
   tissue-engineering structures was 33% more compared to the control type.
   In vivo investigations indicated the rate of biodegradation of
   tissue-engineering structures when implanted in laboratory animals for
   60-90 days. Discussion: The investigated structures are promising for
   use in medical practice. Such structures can act as cardiac
   tissue-engineering implants since they have physicomechanical and
   biological properties similar to the parameters of cardiac tissue.
   Objectives: A major part of developing rotary blood pumps requires the
   optimization of hemolytic properties of the entire pump. The aim of this
   project was to compare blood flow simulation in the first and second
   generations of the ventricular assist device Sputnik and to evaluate its
   effect. Methods: Studies of the flow field were conducted with
   commercial CFD software ANSYS FLUENT 16.0, which uses a finite-volume
   approach. Scalar shear stresses were calculated for both pumps. The
   pumps were compared in terms of volumes subjected to certain viscous
   shear stress thresholds, below which no trauma was assumed (von
   Willebrand factor cleavage: 9 Pa, platelet activation: 50 Pa, and
   hemolysis: 150 Pa), associated residence times and recirculation zones.
   Results: Volume fractions of shear stress above 9 Pa, 50 Pa, 150 Pa were
   received: Sputnik-1 had 7.69 ml, 2,58ml, 0.74 ml, Sputnik-2 - 3.41 ml,
   1.07 ml, 0.22 ml. The sum of the cell residence times at these shear
   stresses is 0.5095 s for the Sputnik-1 and 0.2019 s for the Sputnik-2.
   The volumes of recirculation zones were obtained, the value is 4.36 ml
   for the Sputnik-1 and 1.72 ml for the Sputnik-2. Discussion: The second
   generation of the VAD Sputnik have better flow characteristics than
   first. In the operating point, the volume fraction of the shear stresses
   is less, the residence time is less and the volume of recirculation
   zones is less.
   Objectives: End-stage renal disease is increasing dramatically in the
   western world and represents a major challenge for health care. Due to
   organ shortage transplantation can help only a few patients who
   otherwise require lifelong hemodialysis. Access for hemodialysis is an
   essential point and carries a high morbidity mainly due to occlusion of
   arterio-venous fistulas (AVF) and/or grafts (AVG). Therefore,
   alternative graft material has to be considered such as tissue
   engineered vascular grafts for access in hemodialysis. Methods: Besides
   patient characteristics and technical issues of surgical procedures the
   choice of the vascular graft is essential. Despite optimization over the
   last years, the clinical results are still sub-optimal due to early
   thrombosis and late intimal hyperplasia of the non-degradable synthetic
   vascular grafts such as Expanded-polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE), or,
   polyethylene terephthalate (Dacron). Results: New material developments
   and tissue engineering techniques have shown good pre-clinical and
   initial clinical results for AVG implantation in hemodialysis patients.
   These range from acellular and cell-based, stable or bio-degradable,
   synthetic scaffolds to biological (mandril-induced) or decellularized
   grafts as well as self-assembly technologies. Discussion: This symposium
   will review the clinical need and especially address new developments of
   vascular grafts based on tissue engineering.
   Modern heart failure therapy makes use of left ventricular assist
   devices for severe cases as well as other active implants. While these
   devices have come far from their beginnings with improved
   hemocompatibility, smaller size and less invasive implantation
   techniques, their advancement takes close cooperation of engineers and
   clinicians to face the challenges of further advancements. It is vital
   to ensure interdisciplinary communication and exchange to define the
   future of Mechanical Circulatory Support. On the engineering side,
   greater biocompatibility, patient-specificity and options for smart
   devices and telemedicine offer great potential. These developments go
   hand in hand with improved surgical technique and clinical expertise.
   This cooperation will allow us to work towards reduced mortality, less
   adverse clinical events and ultimately improved quality of life for the
   cardiac assist device patient of the future.
   Objectives: To elucidate the role of the solvent and pH in the
   conformational changes of human serum albumin (HSA) and its binding to
   fatty acids. Albumin is a key biomolecule, found in most fluids of the
   body. HSA functions as depot and carrier for many compounds like fatty
   acids and affects the pharmacokinetics of drugs. Importantly, HSA acts
   as a toxic waste handler, displays pseudo enzymatic properties and it is
   a valuable biomarker in many diseases. Structurally, HSA is a very
   soluble, extremely robust and usually monomeric protein, which features
   three alpha-helical homologous domains that fold into a characteristic
   heart shape. Despite its importance, the reversible pH-dependent
   conformational transitions of HSA in solution are not yet fully
   understood. Methods: To compute the stability differences between the
   different conformers of HSA, we combine molecular dynamics simulations
   (MD) with free energy calculations. We determine the conformational
   free-energy change between conformers of HSA obtained upon introducing
   perturbations in the surroundings (pH, solvent mixtures) and its
   physiologically native state. Extended constant-pH MDs followed by
   Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics simulations allow us modelling
   these systems at different pH values. We perform free energy
   perturbation calculations to characterize the binding sites of fatty
   acids to HSA under different conditions. Results and Discussion: We
   elucidate, at the molecular level, the effects of the solvent and pH on
   the conformational transitions and functionality of HSA. Our work allows
   establishing ways to modulate such transitions by tuning key
   biomolecular interactions, with implications for biomedical research.
   Objectives: The metal ions can affect differentiation of stem cells,
   which makes them interesting for applications in tissue engineering and
   regenerative in medicine. The layer-by-layer (LbL) technique is based on
   the alternating adsorption of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes to
   form polyelectrolyte multilayers (PEM). Multilayer systems combined with
   metal ions of different concentration might be promising for making
   coatings on implants and scaffolds to regenerate tissues like bone,
   cartilage, and others. The purpose of this study is to investigate the
   influence of the concentration of metal ions on the physical properties
   of Polyelectrolyte multilayers (PEM), and evaluate the effect of metal
   ions on stem cell adhesion. Methods: Polyelectrolyte multilayers (PEM)
   prepared by layer-by-layer technique made of polysaccharides hyaluronan
   (HA) as polyanion and chitosan (Chi) as polycation were additionally
   cross-linked by metal ions (Cu2+, Co2+, Ca2+ and Fe3+). to modulate
   physical properties and bioactivity of multilayers to control adhesion
   and function of mesenchymal murine C3H10T1/2 embryonic fibroblasts.
   Characterization of multilayer formation and surface properties was
   performed by different analytical methods. Results: Changes of wetting,
   thickness and mechanical properties of multilayers depending on
   concentration and type of metal ion. Most interesting, however, was the
   finding that metal ions like Fe3+ promoted adhesion and spreading of
   C3H10T1/2 cell greatly on the less adhesive HA/Chi multilayer system
   Discussion: Multilayer systems combined with metal ions can be used to
   regenerate tissues like bone, cartilage and others
   Objectives: The aim of the study is to analyse and modify the gas
   transfer properties of a novel PMP fiber blood gas exchanger with a
   cylindrical shaped blood flow channel by improving the sweep gas flow
   profile through the fiber bundle while considering the fiber length in
   blood contact. Methods: A test set-up has been developed to visualize
   the gas flow through the fiber bundle by means of steam. In an in-vitro
   setting with porcine blood the gas transfer rate has been measured
   subsequently. The cylindrical blood flow geometry and the fact that the
   fibers are stacked with an offset of 90 degrees onto each other results
   in fibers with various effective lengths. For the study, various
   prototypes of gas inlets with different inlet geometries have been
   designed, manufactured and evaluated regarding their gas transfer rates.
   Results: The different designs resulted in the aimed flow profiles
   during the flow visualization. Selected prototypes have been tested with
   blood and the gas transfer rates have been determined. However, the
   modified designs with improved gas flow properties do not significantly
   impact the gas transfer rates measured with blood. Discussion: Two
   possible explanations can be derived from the results which may be
   tested in the course of further studies. Firstly, it is possible that
   the current gas inlet is already sufficiently adapted to the cylindrical
   blood flow geometry and fibers of different effective length. Secondly,
   it could be considered that side parameters such as the diffusive
   transfer of water vapour from the blood side to the gas side have a
   superseding influence on the gas flow profile. In conclusion, the gas
   transfer rates cannot be significantly increased by manipulating the gas
   flow profile through the fiber bundle. Nevertheless, the blood gas
   exchanger achieves already comparable transfer rates to products on the
   market but has reduced PMP membrane surface.
   Objectives: Throughout the history of medical devices, highly invasive
   systems underwent a series of generations prior a successful
   establishment as a widely accepted therapy. The only available THA today
   (SynCardia TAH) is successfully saving lives but comes with a
   significant restriction of the quality of life (QoL) and a
   stigmatization of the patients. According to surgeons this is an
   important factor contributing to the low number of implantations today.
   Methods: Next generation devices using an implanted drive promise a new
   level of QoL and are currently developed by several institutions
   worldwide. Reasons for the long time to market of the next TAH
   generation (>15 years) might be found in the enormous challenges of
   technological aspects together with a difficult marked situation from an
   investors point of view. However, a higher QoL and an increasing trust
   in the reliability of the next TAH generations will inherently lead to a
   higher number of implantations, and further the acceptance of these
   devices towards an established therapy option. Results: The approach of
   the ReinHeart TAH is to adopt the well-proven hydraulic features of the
   SynCardia TAH while improving its current limitations. The ReinHeart TAH
   features a passive filling during diastole, a principal that is also
   successfully applied by the SynCardia TAH. The simple and robust linear
   driving mechanism allows for a compact design, achieving fit in the vast
   majority of patients. Beyond that, the drive principle makes additional
   sensors unnecessary. The compact, smart and usability-driven design of
   the external components will lead to a broad acceptance by the patients.
   Discussion: The unique features of the ReinHeart TAH elevate TAH-therapy
   to the next evolutionary step with regards to robust long-term
   application, size, ease of use and quality of life.
   Objectives: Circulating endothelial cells can be used to diagnose
   cardiovascular diseases. However, their concentration in the blood is
   very low (<100 per ml). A large volume of blood is needed, which should
   not be drawn from the patient. Instead a probe is inserted into the
   bloodstream of the patient to isolate as many cells as possible. The
   geometry of the cell probe is one of the key factors affecting cell
   deposition because its shape influences the flow conditions along the
   cell probe. The aim of this combined in vitro and in silico study is to
   find out the optimal flow conditions for cell deposition aiming to
   develop in future novel optimal cell probe shape. Methods: In vitro
   experiments in a closed loop with endothelial cells from HUVEC cell line
   were carried out and the cell deposition as a function of the probe
   shape (4 probe types) and five different flow rates were investigated.
   The knowledge of the flow conditions at the cell probe was obtained by
   flow simulations by using CFD software STAR CCM+. By combining the
   experimental and simulation data with an iterative procedure, wall shear
   stresses, which seems to promote cell deposition, can be identified.
   Results: It could be shown that the geometry of the cell probe has a
   much greater influence on cell deposition than the flow rates in the
   blood vessel. Wall shear stress around 0.4 Pa seems to be responsible
   for the optimal deposition of endothelial cells. However, this flow
   condition does not correlate with all flow rate experiments. Discussion:
   The results of the combined in vitro - in silico study on deposition of
   endothelial cells on the existing cell probe design are promising.
   However, the used in vitro set up does not allow to extract maximal
   information from each test and should be redesigned.
   Objectives: The left ventricular assist device (LVAD) consists of the
   pump, driveline and peripherals, all of which are potentially subject to
   failure. According to the recent research only 13% of failures were due
   to the pump itself, while over 60% were due to batteries, controllers
   and peripheral cables. Taking into account usability factors we present
   a novel control unit for the rotary blood pumps aimed to decrease LVAD
   malfunction. Methods: The pump motor windings are leaded out by doubled
   wires (six total) via driveline to the extracorporeal splitter where the
   driveline is divided by two ways. Each way consists of three pump motor
   phase signals and three current sense signals from the other way. The
   two identical control units with integrated rechargeable batteries are
   connected to each way of the splitter simultaneously. This symmetrical
   peripherals architecture allows each control unit to drive the pump (in
   the active mode) or sense the parameters from the parallel way (in the
   passive mode). The control is based on the field oriented control method
   that allows the passive unit to continuously monitor the direction and
   magnitude of the magnetic field vector in the pump, which is created by
   the active unit and, upon loss of control, immediately begins to
   generate control signals with the necessary amplitude and phase. In case
   of mismatch of the parameters in any control units, alarms are to occur.
   Results: Novel Sputnik LVAD was developed according to the described
   philosophy. This LVAD system has a backup feature which covers almost
   all peripherals including driveline, control system and battery. In case
   of the single fault condition in the peripherals the system continues to
   drive the pump with pause in the control less than 4 ms. Discussion:
   Developed peripherals integrated in the LVAD allow reducing the risk of
   the device malfunction and improving usability.
   Objectives: Polysaccharides belong to the most abundant biomaterials on
   earth. They form structural elements of plant and animal tissues, but
   many of them have also important regulatory functions towards cells,
   tissues and organs. Glycosaminoglycans (GAG) and other carboxylated and
   sulfated polysaccharides possess a bioactivity that is due to their high
   affinity to a plethora of proteins forming insoluble and soluble
   components of cell environments, but also direct interaction with cell
   receptors. Methods: Making surface coatings for implants from natural or
   semisynthetic GAG that guide cell behavior requires different strategies
   of covalent or physical attachment. Simple covalent binding mechanisms
   can be based on oxidation of pendant hydroxyl groups of monosaccharide
   subunits or introduction of reactive side groups like thiols that permit
   direct coupling to surfaces. Results: Physical can exploit the inherent
   charge of these molecules that permits formation of multilayers kept
   together by ion pairing, but also intrinsic cross-linking of activated
   GAG. Both mechanism can be also used to form 3D structures as
   biocompatible in situ gelling hydrogels that permit embedding of growth
   factors and cells. Discussion: These 2D and 3D systems are instructive
   controlling cell spreading, growth and differentiation, which will be
   shown with examples on chondrogenic and osteogenic differentiation of
   mesenchymal stem and other cells.
   Objectives: A successful creation and adequate maturation of
   arteriovenous fistula (AVF) provides efficient treatment and long term
   patient survival. The aim of the study was to determine the predictors
   for primary failure of AVF, such as gender, age, AVF site of creation,
   and primary renal disease, in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD)
   stage 4/5. Methods: The medical records of 178 created arteriovenous
   fistulae in patients with CKD stage 4/5, in a single center for the year
   2018, were retrospectively studied. Primary failure of AVF was defined
   as thrombosis or inability for cannulation of the fistula within 3
   months of creation. Early thrombosis of AVF was defined as an immediate
   failure due to thrombosis of the fistula within 24 hours of creation.
   Adequate maturation of AVF was defined as successful cannulation of AVF
   for efficient HD. Results: The mean age of the patients was 59.75 +/-
   14.65 years, and 65.16% (116/178) were men. Adequate maturation of
   fistulae was achieved in 83.71% (149/178). Primary failure of AVF
   occurred in 16.29% (29/178) of the created fistulae, while 10.11%
   (18/178) had early thrombosis. Distal AVF (radio-cephalic) was the
   dominant site with 38.76% (69/178) of the created fistulae, followed by
   middle-arm AVF (radio-cephalic) site in 32.02% (57/178) and proximal AVF
   (brachio-basilic) site in 29.22% (52/178) of the created fistulae. The
   distal fistulae were significantly more frequently created in male
   patients (51 vs 18; p=0,015). The female patients were significantly
   older than the male patients (63.27 vs 57.86 years; p=0,018). The
   patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) were significantly older than the
   non-DM patients (63.65 vs 58.05 years; p=0,018). Discussion: Hospital
   strategy for creation of a permanent vascular access for hemodialysis is
   an "Arteriovenous fistula first". The female gender was more frequently
   associated with primary failure of AVF, while age, AVF creation site,
   and primary renal disease were not.
   Objectives: Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and its co-polymer with
   trifluoroethylene (PVDF-TrFE) demonstrating biocompatibility and
   piezoelectric property are among the most promising biomaterials for
   nerve regeneration. Their blends with polydiphenylene phthalide (PDP)
   can improve nerve tissue regeneration due to combined electrical
   switching effect of PDP. Methods: Electrospinning and film casting were
   used to produce porous electrospun fibre mats and thin films,
   respectively. SEM, DSC, RAMAN and FTIR spectroscopy, as well as
   piezoelectric measurements were performed to analyse morphology and
   physical-chemical properties of initial and final materials. A special
   measuring cell was designed to conduct dielectric spectroscopy
   measurements on samples with both deposited and pressed contacts.
   Results: Electrospun PVDF-TrFE and PVDF-TrFE+PDP fibre mats and casted
   PVDF-TrFE, PVDF, PVDF-TrFE+PDP film samples were produced. The range of
   fibre diameter of 0.5-1.2 mu m was obtained from SEM images. RAMAN
   (500-3500 cm(-1)) and FTIR (600-2000 cm(-1)) spectra were obtained for
   initial and final materials. The dependence of the samples capacity on
   the uniaxial pressure was measured. The frequency dependence of the
   capacitance and tangent of the dielectric loss angle tg(delta) at a
   constant uniaxial pressure has also been analysed. Discussion: RAMAN
   spectrum of PDP+PVDF-TrFE fibre mats contains peaks from PDP and
   PVDF-TrFE, indicating that electrospinning method is suitable to produce
   PDP-containing PVDF-TrFE materials. Results of dielectric measurements
   showed that the presence of TrFE in co-polymer significantly reduces the
   value of the samples' capacitance. The capacitance of fibrous samples is
   much lower than that of films due to high porosity of fibre mats (>90%).
   TrFE-containing samples demonstrate high dielectric losses at low
   frequencies. The combined analysis of dielectric and piezoelectric
   properties is ongoing.
   Objectives: The objective of this study is the development of a magnetic
   levitation system of a new type of blood pump. A fully magnetically
   levitated plate is oscillating in a trapezoidal shaped pump housing to
   create a relatively blood gentle flow. The oscillating movement of the
   plate is realized with a combination of a driven harmonic oscillator and
   a 1-degree-of-freedom magnetic levitation system. Methods: Multiple
   design concepts utilizing different electromagnetic principles were 3D
   modelled with Solid Works and imported into Ansys Mawell 3D to execute
   electromagnetic FEM simulations. Based on the results, the most suitable
   concept was selected by means of electromagnetic performance, stability,
   use of space and general feasibility. A PID-controller was implemented
   using Matlab/Simulink. The feasibility and stability of the concept was
   tested on a full-scale prototype. Results: The prototype demonstrates
   the feasibility and stability of the concept. The stabilization of the
   plate can be realized with an electric current that is about 7 times
   lower than bearable for the electromagnetic coils of the first
   prototype, allowing further miniaturization of future prototypes.
   Discussion: Though the general feasibility of the concept could be
   demonstrated, tests of the pumping performances are still pending to
   evaluate the suitability of the pump as an implantable blood pump.
   Objectives: Long term survival rate after the resection for the
   esophageal carcinoma has not been satisfactory. One of the most
   important topics in the area of the esophageal cancer is the
   reconstruction of the esophageal tract. If the artificial esophagus can
   be constructed, this technology will be beneficial for patients with
   esophageal cancer in the advanced stage. Methods: In the previous
   reports, artificial esophagus with shape memory (SMA) alloy actuator had
   been reported. However, total occlusion of the esophageal tract had been
   difficult. In this study, Origami engineering technology had been used
   for the peristaltic motion. Triangle shape of the Origami structure had
   been designed in this study for the total occlusion of the esophageal
   tracts to prevent the gastroesophageal reflux. The corner of the
   triangle had been pulled by SMA actuators following the diagonal lines
   for the folding power. Results: In the design concept of this artificial
   esophagus, the artificial esophageal tracts will be sutured to the
   human's esophagus. In this stage, the artificial esophageal tracts were
   consisted by the artificial vessel's material, and in the next stage
   regenerative esophagus will be the candidates. Esophageal tracts will be
   covered with triangle shape tracts with SMA actuator to embody the
   peristalsis. In the results in this study, total occlusion of the
   artificial esophageal tracts had been embodied by the use of the Origami
   structure. Through the arrangement of the triangle shape origami
   structures, co-driving will be embodied for the peristalsis function.
   Discussion: Until now, there had been no success in achieving
   peristalsis motion of the artificial esophagus. For the application of
   the human esophageal tracts, more study is necessary. This study was the
   first step for the application of the new artificial esophagus in the
   world for the achievement of the totally occluded peristalsis.
   Objectives: The transplantation of human induced pluripotent stem cell
   (hiPSC)-derived grafts represents an alternative treatment option for
   post-myocardial infarction patients. So far, myocardial tissue
   engineering mainly focused on the generation of ventricular-like tissues
   providing sufficient contractile function. Atrial- and pacemaker-like
   cardiomyocytes (CMs) are hypothesized to have a negative effect on
   tissue function, as they could lead to a lower force development and to
   arrhythmias after transplantation, respectively. Therefore, we aim to
   characterize subtype composition in the differentiated CM cultures, as
   well as in generated tissues thereof and analyze tissue functionality.
   Methods: The hiPSC-CMs are then mixed with human fibroblasts and a
   matrix to generate bioartifical cardiac tissues (BCTs) using our
   established bioreactor technology. In order to assess the ratio of
   individual iPSC-derived CM subtypes, flow cytometry and
   immunofluorescence (IF) stainings with antibodies targeting
   subtype-specific markers (MLC2v, COUPTF-2, and MLC2a) were performed.
   Results: First results revealed a high percentage (80-90%) of MLC2v
   positive cells in differentiated CM populations. The remaining cells
   stained positive for atrial markers (COUPTF-2, MLC2a). Functional
   measurements mainly focused on BCT contractility and showed forces
   similar to the native myocardium (6.5 mN/mm2). In addition, we observed
   that a higher proportion of ventricular-like CMs leads to higher
   contractile BCT function. Discussion: Taken together, these molecular
   and functional results reveal that our differentiation protocol led to
   the formation of mainly ventricular-like CMs and that BCTs generated
   thereof show typical characteristics of myocardial tissues. For future
   ventricular-like tissue replacement therapy, we aim to perform a risk
   assessment for "contaminating" cardiac cell types with respect to both
   BCT function and arrhythmias.
   Objectives: Standardized hemolysis tests according to ASTM F1841-97
   (2017) are the current gold standard for hemolysis evaluation. As part
   of the standard flow loop, a screw clamp is used to regulate the flow
   resistance in the circulations. Especially with extracorporeal pumps
   used for lung support, cardiopulmonary bypass application, or
   C0(2)-Removal, resistance has to maintain a pressure gradient of more
   than 500 mmHg. As a consequence, the screw clamp itself turns into a
   critical hemolysis hotspot, possibly overlying and biasing the hemolysis
   caused by the tested pump. Therefore, we present an alternative
   resistance causing only low hemolysis and at the same time maintaining
   ASTM testing specifications. Methods: We developed one novel resistance
   and evaluated the hemolysis potential of the novel and one alternative
   in flow loops. The flow loops were set up according to the ASTM standard
   with three identical pumps (Deltastream (R) DP3, Medos AG), two with the
   novel and alternative resistances each and one with the state-of-the art
   resistance, the screw clamp. The loops were set to high pressure
   conditions present in cardiopulmonary bypass applications, ECMO or
   C0(2)-Removal. The loops operated for 6 hours with porcine blood (n =
   6). Blood samples were drawn hourly and free plasma hemoglobin was
   evaluated by means of photometric measurement. Results: A new resistance
   for ASTM pump evaluation at high pressure regimes with little impact on
   hemolysis was developed. The resistance is easy to integrate into the
   recirculation loop and can be adjusted continuously. In-vitro blood
   trials revealed lower hemolysis for the new resistance compared to the
   current gold standard. Discussion: Extracorporeal continuous flow blood
   pumps with transfemoral cannulation work against high pressure at low
   flow. Up to now, hemolysis evaluation of the pumps is biased by
   hemolysis caused by the flow loop resistance. Our newly designed
   resistance causes less hemolysis, thus allowing for more meaningful and
   reliable hemolysis test results.
   Objectives: To characterize the biological background of prothrombotic
   platelet function in the setting of durable Mechanical Circulatory
   Support (MCS) with Left Ventricular Assist Devices (LVADs) and to
   evaluate influence of different antithrombotic regimens dictated by
   specific clinical needs. Methods: Platelet thrombin generation was
   quantified in 75 LVAD patients implanted with the HeartMate II (n=10,
   13%), HeartMate 3 (n=27, 36%), or HeartWare HVAD (n=38, 51%) using the
   Platelet Activity State (PAS) Assay and the Thrombin Generation Test
   (TGT). Data was compared in patients managed with i) oral
   anticoagulation plus aspirin (n=46, 61%) or ii) anticoagulation alone
   (n=29, 39%) due to significant bleeding risk. Coagulation parameters
   (platelet count, International Normalized Ratio [INR], activated Partial
   Thromboplastin Time [aPTT], Fibrinogen and D-Dimers levels) and
   hemolysis index (lactate dehydrogenase levels, LDH) were also recorded
   to comprehensively characterize hemostatic profiles and actual
   prothrombotic risk in the two groups. Results: The PAS assay revealed
   low-intensity increase in platelet prothrombinase activity in patients
   without aspirin (1.13-fold higher; p=0.04). Similarly, the TGT revealed
   moderate higher platelet reactivity in patients not on aspirin,
   consistent with reduction of lag time (0.87-fold lower; p<0.001),
   increase in peak of thrombin generation (1.5-fold higher; p=0.002) and
   thrombin generation rate (2-fold higher; p=0.01), but comparable
   endogenous thrombin potential (p>0.05). Coagulation parameters and LDH
   levels were not different in these two groups (p>0.05). Discussion: In
   patients with a durable MCS, aspirin minimally modulates the biochemical
   pathway of platelet thrombin generation. Re-evaluation of antithrombotic
   management criteria in selected patients stratified according to
   bleeding risk might significantly reduce LVAD hemcompatibility-related
   adverse events.
   Objectives: To determine the value of post-reperfusion kidney biopsyin
   predicting renal function and the incidence rate of DGF in deceased
   donor renal transplant recipients within 1 year after the surgery.
   Methods: We retrospectively included 461 patients who accepted the
   donation after the death of citizen at our center. According to the
   Remuzzi criteria, we compared the pathological biopsy and graft outcome
   between right and left donor kidneys from the same donor.Remuzzi score 
   pound 3 was divided into low group, 4-6 middle group, > 6 high group.
   The incidence of delayed graft function (DGF), acute rejection (AR) and
   renal function within 1 year after surgery was observed. A multivariate
   analysis was conducted on the risk factors of kidney function and DGF
   incidence. Results: Of the 461 recipients,458 recipients have good graft
   function and 3 grafts failed. The reperfusion kidney biopsy, the
   incidence of graft DGF and renal function at each time point after
   transplantation between the left and right kidneys from the same donor
   were same (p>0.05). 88.1% was in low group, 10.4% in middle group, and
   1.5% in high group. The incidence of DGF and the eGFR in different time
   points after transplantation were different (p<0.05). Multivariate
   analysis revealed that last creatinine before acquisition and Remuzzi
   score were independent predictors of DGF after transplantation (p<0.05).
   Vascular scores were independent risk factors affecting renal function
   at 1 year after transplantation(p<0.05) Discussion: The reperfusion
   renal allograft biopsy can reflect the donor's baseline data and predict
   early renal function after transplantation. Renal vascular disease may
   be an independent predictor of poor prognosis of the graft.
   The ongoing development of modern manufacturing processes, as well as
   the automation and cross-linking of production facilities opens up new
   freedoms for the individualized manufacturing of medical devices. The
   patient-specific design of these highly loaded devices is associated
   with a high degree of experience on the part of the designer. The
   assessment of the safety and performance of these " lot size 1 products"
   cannot be carried out economically by mechanical testing. This results
   in a verification gap in the product life cycle of patient-specific
   medical devices. A verification of the design and thus the evaluation of
   the function and safety of the products can only be carried out
   economically with the help of automated numerical simulations. A
   software to perform virtual strength assessment of custom implants was
   developed. The lecture shows how the verification process of
   patient-individual designs with numerical methods, can contribute to the
   increase of patient safety. In addition, the integration and
   documentation of numerical simulations within the product life cycle
   will be presented using industrial examples.
   Objectives: One of the most pressing issues of regenerative medicine is
   the fabrication of constructs with defined parameters in order to create
   conditions for proper cell adhesion and proliferation that will be close
   to native tissue conditions. An application utilizing the
   electrospinning method may potentially solve this problem. The main goal
   of this study was to fabricate electrospun scaffolds based on silk
   fibroin and to characterize their properties. Methods: Silk fibroin
   scaffolds were obtained by electrospinning method. There were two types
   of scaffolds: 1) silk fibroin scaffolds, 2) silk fibroin scaffolds with
   addition of 30 per cent of gelatin by mass. Scaffold structure was
   investigated by scanning electron microscopy and scanning probe
   nanotomography. Cell adhesion and proliferation were investigated in
   mice fibroblasts 3T3 model. The regenerative potential of scaffolds was
   estimated in a model of Wistar rat full-thickness skin wound
   regeneration. Results: The electrospun scaffolds have fibrous porous
   structure with an average fiber thickness 300-600 nm. Both types of
   scaffolds are biocompatible in vitro. Presence of gelatin in scaffold
   composition improves cell proliferation. Scaffolds promote skin wound
   regeneration and restore native skin structure. Histological analysis
   did not evolve inflammatory process. Discussion: Electrospinning is a
   promising method to obtain fibrous biomimetic constructs with defined
   properties. The biocompatibility of produced constructs was shown in
   vitro and in vivo. Both types of scaffolds have a significant
   regenerative potential and are prospects for different fields of
   regenerative medicine.
   Objectives: Biodegradable PCL-based electrospun scaffolds are often used
   in TE. However, such scaffolds lack biocompatibility, wettability and
   chemical accessibility for tendon replacement applications. Here, we
   propose a new method to overcome those shortcomings by using
   PCL:Chitosan-graft-PCL (PCL:CS-g-PCL) blends instead of post-process
   coatings. Methods: Blended solutions of PCL (175 mg/ml in 2,2,2-TFE) and
   CS-g-PCL (1200 mg/ml in chloroform) were electrospun into scaffolds with
   CS-g-PCL from 0 to 90 wt% (10 ratios). SEM based measurements were
   carried out to investigate fiber diameter and morphology. Chitosan amino
   groups within the fibers were quantified by nuclear magnetic resonance
   spectroscopy (H-1-NMR) and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). DSC
   measurements were conducted to assess thermal properties and
   crystallinity. Subsequently, metabolic activity of human mesenchymal
   stromal cells (hMSC) seeded on the scaffolds, was determined over 7
   days. Results: Blends with CS-g-PCL contents < 90 wt% led to fiber
   diameter of 1 +/- 0.35 mu m and to 2 +/- 0.38 mu m for 90 wt%. XPS
   measurements showed an enrichment of chitosan amino groups at the
   surface of the fibers. The enthalpy of fusion increased by up to 40 J/g
   for CS-g-PCL contents from 0 to 90 wt%, indicating a significant
   increase in crystallinity. hMSCs had maximum metabolic activity on
   samples with CS-g-PCL contents between 10 and 30 wt%. Discussion:
   Electrospinning of blended PCL:CS-g-PCL solutions resulted in higher
   crystallinity while preserving mechanical properties. Furthermore,
   increased wettability improved biocompatibility and chemical
   accessibility, which ultimately influenced the metabolic activity of the
   hMSCs positively. This promising novel approach will increase the
   biocompatibility of PCL-based scaffolds with simultaneous reduction in
   production complexity.
   Objectives: Biventricular assist device (BVAD) is reported to be used in
   3-5% of continuous-flow VAD (cf-VAD). Our recent strategy is to
   stabilize INTERMACS profile 1 or unstable profile 2 patients by
   paracorporeal VAD, central ECMO or IABP before proceeding to cf-VAD.
   Patients with RV failure are also aggressively treated by PDE-5
   inhibitors or endothelin receptor antagonist at the outpatient clinic
   after implant. We examined validity of this strategy by analyzing BVAD
   necessity and patient survival. All cf-VAD was used for bridge to
   transplantation. Average waiting time for heart transplantation is
   nearly 3.5 years in our country. Methods: 166 consecutive patients were
   implanted with cf-VAD. DCM was seen in 113, ICM in 14, dHCM in 12,
   post-myocarditis CM in 6, ARVC in 3, RCM in 3 and others in 15. 130
   patients underwent primary cf-LVAD implantation. Pre-implant profiles of
   those patients were 2 in 62, 3 in 62 and 4 in 6. 36 patients were
   converted from another type of mechanical circulatory support (MCS).
   Actuarial survival was calculated by Kaplan-Meier analysis and
   comparisons were made using Log-rank method. Results: No patient
   required RVAD at the time of implantation nor late after implantation.
   Average support duration was 787 days, and 53 patients were on the
   support longer than 3 years. During follow-up 56 patients reached
   transplantation, 9 weaned from VAD due to functional recovery and 80
   on-going support. 1-, 2-, 3-year survival of 166 patients was 92.8%,
   89.5% and 85.9%. There were no statistical differences between
   subgroups, such as sex, pre-implant profile, body size and primary/redo
   sternotomy. Discussion: We successfully implanted cf-LVAD and managed in
   the outpatient clinic without RVAD support in 166 consecutive patients,
   including those who were severely ill in the pre-implant stage. Our
   strategy for stabilizing profile 1 and unstable profile 2 patients by
   other types of MCS and aggressive use of PDE-5 inhibitors or endothelin
   receptor antagonist seemed to be safe and effective.
   Objectives: Recently, composite bionanomaterials containing biological
   materials and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been actively studied. CNTs
   may contain catalytic ferromagnetic nanoparticles and they can affect
   the properties of the composite bionanomaterial. To the study of this
   issue, we paid attention. The object of the study was a composite
   nanomaterial consisting of bovine serum albumin (BSA - matrix) and
   single-walled CNT (SWCNT - filler). Methods: Aqueous dispersion in the
   composition of 20 wt.% BSA and 0.01 wt.%. SWCNTs were prepared using
   traditional nanotechnology methods (thorough mixing, ultrasonic
   homogenization, decanting, etc.). The optical density of dispersion was
   measured after a magnetic field gradient ( 1 T/m) was applied to it for
   100 hours. The obtained values were compared with the optical dispersion
   density in the absence of a magnetic field. Recent samples were
   considered control. Results: It was found that under the action of a
   magnetic field, the optical density of the water dispersion of BSA/SWCNT
   in the region of 300 divided by 800 nm decreases by > 10% relative to
   control samples. Additionally, it was found that under the action of a
   magnetic field, the optical density of the aqueous dispersion of
   BSA/SWCNT decreases by > 10% relative to control samples. Discussion:
   The decrease in the optical dispersion density of BSA/SWCNT is caused by
   the deposition of nanotubes on the cell surface under the action of a
   magnetic field gradient. It is assumed that the single walled carbon
   nanotubes contain catalytic ferromagnetic nanoparticles. Estimates
   showed that in bionanomaterial at a level with concentrations > 0.0001
   wt.% CNT nanotubes can be fixed with modern sensors of a weak magnetic
   field with a threshold sensitivity of <= 1 pT. It was concluded that
   changes in implants in the BSA/SWCNT composite bionanomaterials can be
   observed non-invasively with the help of weak magnetic field sensors
   (for example, SQUID or CMFS).
   Objectives: Recent developments in imaging technology have enabled
   cryobiologists to reveal some mechanisms employed by nature to cope with
   freezing stress. The systematic study of these mechanisms may prove
   useful for developing ultimately novel and efficient cryopreservation
   protocols. In this work, we examine the potential advantages of using
   infrared video thermography (IVT) for monitoring latent heat release and
   freeze-thaw events in 3D porous collagen-hydroxyapatite scaffolds used
   as a model system. In this context, we present ongoing results on the
   identification of warm ice-nucleating agents (INA) from Hippophae
   rhamnoides with potential use in cryopreservation of tissue-engineered
   constructs (TECs). Methods: The scaffolds were prepared by freeze-drying
   of mineralized collagen suspensions and characterized by Raman
   microscopy, X-ray microcomputed tomography and differential scanning
   calorimetry. Visualization of freezing/thawing events in scaffolds
   frozen with and without cryoprotective solutions based on leaf
   homogenate from Hippophae rhamnoides was performed using the
   thermography-based platform developed at the University of Thessaly.
   Results: Scaffolds presented 3D porous architecture and characteristic
   RAMAN peaks of collagen type I and hydroxyapatite (HAP). Presence of HAP
   decreased the specific heat capacity of collagen scaffolds. The
   probability of ice nucleation was higher in cryoptotective solutions
   with scaffolds than in solutions without. The ice nucleation temperature
   within scaffolds using INA was determined to be around -1.5 degrees C.
   Discussion: IVT proved to be a very effective approach for visualizing
   latent heat release and freeze-thaw events within scaffolds frozen in
   cell culture plates. INA from Hippophae rhamnoides may potentially be
   used for prevention of supercoiling in cryopreservation. The results
   obtained could serve as a basis for further development of efficient
   cryopreservation protocols for 3D TECs.
   Objectives: In the development process of heart assist devices,
   numerical simulations become more and more essential. The variety of
   applications comprises different types of cannulas or flow geometries of
   ventricular assist devices (VADs). The analysis of the flow field inside
   VADs by means of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is extremely useful.
   Numerical parameter studies allow the treatment of several device
   related problems in conjunction with a well-balanced cost-benefit ratio.
   Methods: Results obtained from properly performed CFD calculations
   permit the determination of flow induced blood damage of new flow
   designs in VADs and enable the prediction of the risk of harmful
   hemolysis for the patient. The literature provides different models for
   blood cell damages. In application, a proper definition of acceptable
   thresholds is required, in order to optimize blood guiding geometries as
   rotor blades or diffusor shapes in VADs. Another application of CFD can
   be found in the field of flow path optimization of new cannula designs.
   Corresponding results can lead to various design changes and can
   significantly contribute to a comprehensive risk analysis for regulatory
   assessment. Results: Based on the numerical results, geometrical design
   iterations can considerably improve the flow design of blood pumps and
   cannulas. Thoroughly optimized designs exert reduced shear stresses to
   the cells and create less damage to the patient's blood. Furthermore,
   CFD studies can provide valuable information in the process of risk
   analysis during the regulatory assessment of heart assist devices and
   support the interpretation of experimental in-vitro investigations.
   Discussion: Although numerical simulations represent a commonly used
   tool during research and development in the field of heart assist
   devices, the introduction of strict requirements and well-defined
   guidelines would considerably simplify the implementation of numerical
   studies for regulatory approval and enhance the comparability of
   independently gained results.
   Objectives: Current standards in cryopreservation for biomedical
   technology are still based on slow freezing processes inducing
   crystallization within the sample. In preparation for this
   cryopreservation regime, cells and tissues are detached from growth
   surfaces and dissociated into single cell suspensions. Existing
   infrastructures like freezing devices, lab ware, and liquid nitrogen
   tanks for long-term storage, are designed for the handling of suspended
   cells and tissues and for stock keeping purposes, these procedures
   usually are efficient enough. Through the addition of cryoprotective
   agents, the sample can cope with the emerging damaging mechanism
   resulting from ice crystal formation. However, diagnostically and
   therapeutically relevant cell systems, e.g. human induced pluripotent
   stem cells (hiPSCs) or their derivates like neuronal cells, depend on
   cell-cell and cell-surface interactions mediated by cytoskeletal
   proteins. Their structures are disordered, either due to these
   preparatory dissociating steps or due to crystallization, resulting in
   loss of functionality or cell loss in general. Methods: A second
   cryopreservation regime, the vitrification, avoids crystallization
   within the sample and thus avoids the occurring damaging mechanisms
   (e.g. shear forces, osmotic shock). Thereby, the structure of cells and
   tissues is preserved, leading to viable and functional cells even in
   their adherent state (with cell-cell and cell-surface contacts) after
   thawing. However, vitrification requires a skilled handling and so far,
   the infrastructure has not been established to enable routine
   vitrification workflows for large cell numbers. Results and Discussion:
   Our work shows the potential and capacity of vitrification on different
   cell types (e.g. hiPSCs, dopaminergic neurons). We demonstrate that
   vitrification is superior to slow freezing regarding cell loss and
   functionality and holds the possibility to cryopreserve scalable and
   ready-to-use cell products for a broad range of biomedical research.
   Objectives: The aim of this work is to characterize the decellularized
   human chorion membrane (dHCM) and to study its suitability as a
   substrate to model biological barriers. Methods: HCMs were submitted to
   a chemical and physical decellularization process. The decellularization
   protocol was optimized by quantifying and analyzing the presence and
   distribution of cell nuclei and dsDNA by DAPI staining, PicoGreen and
   electrophoresis. The dHCM was characterized by scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM), immunohistochemistry, Dot-Blot, SDS-PAGE, and GAGs and
   Collagen quantification. Moreover, dHCM's mechanical properties were
   assessed and biocompatibility tests (metabolic and proliferation assays)
   with an endothelial human cell line (EA.hy.926) were performed. Results:
   The decellularization process of the HCM was successful, since the
   presence of nuclei was not observed, the amount of dsDNA was around 10
   ng/mg of dry tissue, and the DNA fragments had less than 200 bp. A
   compact membrane that preserved the HCM's reticular layer and basement
   membrane was obtained. SEM images revealed that dHCM is a substrate with
   two different surfaces: one composed by nanofibers and the other (in
   trophoblast layer's side) covered by a thin compact layer (basement
   membrane). In tissue sections it was possible to verify the presence of
   collagen type I and IV, fibronectin and laminin in both dHCM and native
   tissue. Corroborating these results higher molecular weight species were
   preserved in dHCM (SDS-PAGE). Additionally, dHCM's mechanical properties
   were determined: young's modulus of 5.9 MPa and ultimate tensile
   strength of 5.3 MPa. Differences in metabolic activity and cell
   proliferation were observed between both sides of the dHCM. Discussion:
   dHCM retained the main proteins of the extracellular matrix. Cell
   proliferation and viability were higher in the side of dHCM that
   preserved the basement membrane. dHCM's physical and mechanical
   properties make it a suitable substrate to mimic biological barriers.
   Objectives: Cryogels with improved non-fouling and cell adhesive surface
   properties were investigated as potential cell scaffold for BAL purpose.
   Cryogel monolith columns were used by other groups to fill the
   bioreactor chamber. However, device performance was not maintained for
   more than a few hours. Fluid dynamic measurements using a purpose-built
   mu PIV setup with video post-processing were conducted in order to
   extrapolate the effect of flow inside the cryogel matrix to improve cell
   viability and avoid blood cell activation. Starting from PIV results, a
   multi-layered bioreactor composed of spaced cryogel discs was developed
   to maximise blood/hepatocyte mass-exchange. This study aimed to
   investigate whether the multi-layered design results in improved
   performance compared to the column version in terms of hepatocytes
   viability and functionality. Methods: p(HEMA-co-MBA) cryogels were
   synthesised by cryogelation technique. Cryogels were then functionalised
   with alginate and RGD peptide and synthesised by solid phase method.
   Porous structure was analysed with SEM, confocal imaging and mu CT.
   Non-fouling properties were investigated by protein absorption studies.
   Cell viability was assessed by MTT/ATP activity and live/dead imaging.
   Hepatocyte functionality in bioreactors was investigated by
   quantification of albumin and urea production using ELISA and
   colorimetric assay, respectively, over time. Results: Synthesised
   cryogels possessed an open porosity with pore sizes of up to 100 mu m
   and an interconnected network of pores. Alginate helped preventing
   protein absorption from plasma. RGD peptide enhanced hepatocyte
   functionality. Cryogel perfused bioreactors maintained hepatocytes
   viability and functionality for up to 1 week. Discussion: Multi-layered
   bioreactor design showed a significantly higher production of albumin
   and urea compared to the column version, suggesting an improved mass
   exchange between medium and cells. Also cell colonization and
   proliferation through the device were improved.
   Objectives: Placental complex, including placental tissues, foetal
   membranes, and umbilical cord, is one of the most promising sources of a
   range of tissues and cells for clinical and experimental application in
   regenerative medicine and tissue engineering. Certain components of
   placental material are already applied in medicine since decades, while
   others undergo intensive research and pre-clinical trials. Since
   placenta is a temporary organ, it provides the unique opportunity to
   obtain large amounts of tissues, including autologous, without the
   adverse effects to the donor. Moreover, great potential of placental
   multipotent stromal cells is recognized in generation of tissue
   engineered multicellular constructs. At the same time, clinical use and
   research proceedings are significantly restricted due to imperfections
   in storage technologies. Application of low-temperature preservation
   methods is especially challenging for 3-D multicellular structures, such
   as organs, tissues, and tissue engineered constructs. Methods: Here we
   aim to analyze the variety of cryoinjuries in a range of placental
   tissues and tissue engineered multicellular placental constructs, as
   well as support the cellular viability after low temperature storage. A
   range of cell and tissue culture as well as tissue engineering methods,
   cryomicroscopic analysis, evaluation of phenotypic and metabolic
   characteristics have been applied in this study. Results: Results have
   shown that the mechanisms of damage caused by cryopreservation
   procedures depend on particular structure of the studied object,
   peculiarities of intercellular bonds, as well as interaction with
   cryoprotective agents. At the same time, developed protocols allowed us
   to efficiently isolate viable cells after thawing of the studied
   tissues. Discussion: Conclusions of this study may lead to progress in
   improvement of biobanking technologies for tissues and tissue engineered
   multicellular constructs.
   Extracorporeal therapies, such as hemodialysis, apheresis or blood
   oxygenation, are only possible when recurrent blood access is feasible.
   Both, artificial grafts, e.g. made of polyethylene-terephthalate (Dacron
   (R)) or a fistula are not ideal models for that purpose and are commonly
   considered to represent the Achilles` Heel of extracorporeal blood
   circuits. A stable, implantable biologic vascular graft would be an
   ideal solution for the benefit of patients and many bioengineers are
   working on this dream to come true. When considering such a vascular
   graft to be used clinically and as a product to be sold in the medical
   device market, a series of problems with regard to approval have to be
   solved and some fundamental questions be answered. Regarding approval,
   current EU regulations refer to either the Medical Device Regulation
   (MDR) from 2017 or to Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products Regulation
   (ATMPs) from 2007. Under the premise "Better safe than sorry!"
   regulations, such as MDR and ATMP, represent a European law. A
   bioengineered vascular graft is taken as a "combination product", as it
   is commonly made of biological cells and a (possibly) biodegradable
   scaffold material. When implanted, it would represent a high-risk class
   III medical device under the MDR regulation and would require a CE-mark.
   The ATMP regulation, however, says that a combination product has to be
   approved following the "principal mode of action". For products
   containing viable cells or tissues, a specific approach has been taken
   by the EU. For these products it holds true that "whatever the role of
   the medical device, the pharmacological, immunological or metabolic
   action of these cells are considered to be the principal mode of
   action". Under these premises, a combination product, such as a
   bioengineered vascular graft, is regulated under the ATMP rules, which
   renders approval rather complex. Consequences refer to the need of Phase
   I-III clinical trials including post-market surveillance
   Neuroengineering is a research area where engineering skills are used to
   solve basic and clinical problems in neuroscience. The aim of the
   presentation is to give an insight into neuroengineering applied in
   neurosurgery. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a method for reducing
   symptoms in movement disorders as Parkinson's disease and essential
   tremor. A thin electrode is surgically implanted with stereotactic
   technique at a well-defined brain structure. Our research focus on
   support systems for improving the surgical implantation procedure, and
   to increase the understanding of the DBS mechanism. A method for
   performing patient-specific simulations of the electric field around a
   DBS lead and map the data to the anatomy has been developed. The goal is
   to create improvement and side-disorder maps for the most common
   symptoms and brain targets used in DBS. Optics is another core area we
   apply in neurosurgery. Several optical probe systems for intraoperative
   guidance have been developed. Forward-looking probes can act as "vessel
   alarm" by recording the tissue's microcirculation with laser Doppler
   flowmetry during creation of the brain trajectories in relation to
   stereotactic neurosurgery. In DBS this method has been evaluated in the
   clinical setting in more than 100 implantations. For brain tumor
   biopsies the method is presently introduced in combination with 5-ALA
   fluorescence measurements at the tumor border. 5-ALA induced
   fluorescence spectroscopy- and microscopy can also be used together in
   brain tumor surgery. Under the neurosurgical "blue-light" microscope, a
   hand-held probe supports the surgeon by enhancing malignant tissue.
   Another challenge is optical monitoring of cerebral microcirculation in
   the neuro-intensive care setting. A prerequisite for successful project
   outcome is a close collaboration between biomedical engineers and
   neurosurgeons. difference.
   Objectives: The main goal of this study was to synthesize
   polysaccharide-based hydrogel systems that favor bone regeneration. The
   hydrogel formation is driven by Schiff base crosslinking reaction
   between the amino functionalities of carboxymethyl chitosan (CMChi) and
   the aldehyde groups of the different oxidized polysaccharides resulting
   in an imine bond formation. Methods: Different amounts of NaIO4 were
   used in order to oxidize Alginate (ALG) and Hyaluronic acid (HA),
   forming reactive dialdehyde derivatives with different oxidation
   degrees. The amount of aldehyde groups was determined by: A) using
   Schiff's reagent and detected by a UV-Vis spectrometer (550nm) and B)
   acid base titration after reacting the aldehyde groups with
   Hydroxylammoniumchloride. Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC) was used
   for molecular weight determination of the different polysaccharides.
   Biocompatibility of the products was tested using Qblue (R) assay and
   CFDA staining. Results: Data obtained from both UV-VIS spectroscopy and
   titration show that the different polysaccharides have more aldehyde
   groups when high concentrations of NaIO4 were used and the reaction
   times were extended. The weight average molecular weights of all the
   products were lower after the oxidation step. Products with high
   oxidation degrees showed low biocompatibility. Discussion: ALG and HA
   with high oxidation degrees are required to prepare stable hydrogel
   systems and the dual utility of using CMChi and oxidized polysaccharides
   as both structural and bioactive component is promising for the
   formation of biocompatible hydrogel systems that can be used for bone
   tissue regeneration.
   Objectives: Xenotransplantation of transgenic porcine pancreatic islets
   offers a promising alternative source to circumvent current limitations
   posed by the scarcity of allogeneic donors. However, either immune
   rejection or oxygen supply in immune protected encapsulated islets
   remains a major concern. To decrease xenogeneic immune responses, we
   have investigated the feasibility to generate tissue engineered SLA
   silenced islet cell clusters (ICC) from alpha-Gal knock out, CD46, CD55
   and CD59 transgenic minipigs. Methods: Pancreatic islets single cell
   suspensions were generated by enzymatic digestion of porcine ICCs. The
   single cells were silenced for SLA class I and II by lentiviral vectors
   encoding for Nanoluciferase as reporter gene and for short hairpin RNAs
   targeting beta2-microglobulin (shb2m) or class II transactivator
   (shCIITA), respectively. SLA transcripts were evaluated by real-time PCR
   and protein levels by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy
   analyses. Cell death was evaluated by Propidium Iodide staining. The
   effect of SLA class I silencing was evaluated in human T and NK cell
   cytotoxicity assays. SLA-silenced pancreatic beta-cells were then used
   to form new ICCs in stirred bioreactors. Results: SLA class I silencing
   was designed to reach a level of up to 86% and class II by up to 64% on
   pancreatic islet cell monolayers. Silencing SLA expression did not
   affect cell viability and the insulin-producing beta-cell phenotype as
   indicated by Dithizone staining and levels of insulin production.
   Xenogeneic T-cell immune responses (p<0.05) as well as antibody-mediated
   cellular-dependent immune responses (p<0.01) were significantly
   decreased. Silencing SLA class I expression did not increase
   susceptibility to NK-cell cytotoxicity. In stirred bioreactors, tissue
   engineered islets showing the typical 3D-structure and morphology of ICC
   were assembled from SLA-silenced pancreatic cell suspensions to be used
   for transplantation in humanized mice as a first model. Discussion:
   These data shows the feasibility to generate low immunogenic porcine ICC
   from transgenic pigs after single cell engineering and post-
   transduction islet reassembling that might serve as a robust alternative
   to allogeneic pancreatic islet cell transplantation.
   Objectives: In patients with circulatory support, preload is a valuable
   clinical monitoring variable. While it is difficult to measure directly,
   it can be indirectly measured by PCWP or left atrial pressure (LAP).
   Typically, assessments of LAP require invasive methods. However,
   non-invasive estimation of LAP can be a useful tool for monitoring
   patients and adjusting pump speed to reduce the likelihood of hazardous
   events, such as ventricular suction and pulmonary congestion. This study
   presents an artificial neural network model estimating the LAP
   noninvasively across different patient conditions. Methods: LAP was
   estimated based on the HeartWare HVAD pump characteristics (current,
   flow and speed) derived from 186 experiments performed in a mock
   circulatory system with HVAD speed range from 1800 to 3600 rpm. The LAP
   estimation was evaluated by measuring the hemodynamic variables in
   response to a range of changes to the mock cardiovascular system,
   including changes in PVR, SVR and HR. A neural network was trained with
   70% of the data (randomly chosen), and was validated and tested with the
   rest of data. The model performance was quantified by the mean squared
   error (MSE), correlation coefficient (r2) and Bland-Altman plot between
   measured and estimated LAP in different scenarios. Results: The neural
   network model was able to estimate LAP accurately using data collected
   in-vitro for training, validation and test sets. The MSE for all data is
   1.36 mmHg, and correlation coefficients are 0.99, 0.91 and 0.94 for
   training, validation and test sets, respectively. The Bland-Altman plot
   showed that error has a bias of 0.28 mmHg with a reproducibility
   coefficient of 2.2 mmHg. Discussion: The developed model would be useful
   for a real-time estimation of preload noninvasively which can be
   employed to adjust pump speed in heart-failure patients without
   inserting a pulmonary catheter into the pulmonary artery. Implementation
   of the developed estimator would also create a new physiological control
   system that can work noninvasively.
   Objectives: Blood vessels are integral to the maintenance of all
   tissues. They deliver oxygen and nutrients and remove waste. Blood
   vessels not only contain endothelial cells (ECs) that are in direct
   contact with flowing blood cells and fluids but they may also have
   pericytes and smooth muscle cells on the outside that stabilize and
   regulate their size. Defects in EC and pericyte/smooth muscle cell
   interaction are often implicated in many pathological conditions.
   Patients with a genetic disease called hereditary hemorrhagic
   telangiectasia (HHT) suffer from heavy and recurrent nosebleeds, due to
   unstable blood vessels as a result of defective interaction between ECs
   and pericytes. Methods: Here we used human induced pluripotent stem
   cells (hiPSCs) as a source of patient-specific cells, as they can be
   derived from all individuals, including children and patients with
   genetic disease and subsequently differentiated towards all cells of the
   body. Besides, we can now use hiPSCs to derive all the component of
   blood vessels in large numbers and use them to re-create blood vessels
   on a chip to model inflammation and disease. Results: HHT-hiPSC-ECs
   displayed no apparent functional differences using a set of standard
   two-dimensional (2D) assays. The ability of hiPSC-ECs to form a perfused
   microvascular network was next examined using three-dimensional (3D)
   cultures in microfluidic chips. Using these 3D vessels on a chip, we
   found that in contrast to 2D microvascular cultures, the ability to form
   3D microvessels in microfluidic chips was strikingly compromised when
   HHT-hiPSC-ECs were used compared to isogenic control ECs. Discussion:
   This patient-based hiPSC model thus serves as the first proof of
   principle that vascular diseases could be modeled using patient-specific
   hiPSCs in 3D microfluidic chips and to identify new target cells and
   possible pathways for therapy.
   Objectives: This study was aimed at fabricating various layer-by-layer
   (LbL) systems using glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) with the capability to
   bind BMP-2 specifically in order to control osteogenic differentiation
   of cells by biocompatible release systems. Methods: Heparin, chondroitin
   sulfate and their oxidized forms as polyanions were combined with
   chitosan and collagen I as polycations to form various multilayer
   coatings on model materials with the advantage of the intrinsic
   cross-linking formed between oxidized glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and
   polycations, improving multilayer stability and affecting the release of
   BMP-2. The myoblast cell line C2C12, which can differentiate into
   osteoblasts was seeded on 5 mu g/mL BMP-2 loaded multilayers. Cell
   viability, adhesion, osteogenic differentiation and BMP-2 release were
   investigated. Results: C2C12 cells cultured directly on the top of
   multilayers showed that particularly BMP-2 loaded multilayers made of
   oxidized GAGs promoted an osteogenic differentiation that was nearly
   comparable to the positive control, when 5 mu g/mL BMP-2 was added
   directly to the medium. Interestingly, the BMP-2 had synergistic effect
   on cell adhesion and spreading. BMP-2 in oxidized chondroitin sulfate
   multilayers was successfully loaded to the layers, sustainably released
   over time and affected cell differentiation more than the soluble BMP-2.
   Discussion: The results show that oxidized GAGs forming intrinsically
   cross-linked multilayers are useful as reservoirs for sustained release
   of BMP-2 in which the intrinsic cross-linking affected BMP-2 release,
   improved multilayers stability due to the resulting stiff surface
   compared to the native ones, supported cell adhesion, proliferation and
   subsequent differentiation. This can pave the way for coating implants
   and scaffolds for repair and regeneration of bone fractures.
   Objectives: Functional myocardial recovery during support with left
   ventricular assist devices (LVADs) is highly desirable but only observed
   in approx. 1% of all patients. Previously, the more frequently implanted
   pulsatile blood pumps (PBPs) showed higher recovery rates than the
   currently used rotary blood pumps (RBPs). The aim of this study was to
   comparatively assess the capability of PBPs and RPBs to unload the left
   ventricle and restore physiological cardiac energetics in isolated
   hearts. Methods: An RBP (Medtronic HVAD) and a heartbeat synchronized
   PBP (BerlinHeart Excor) were alternately connected to eight isolated
   porcine hearts. To modulate the mode of LVAD support, RBP rotational
   speed was set to different support levels and ejection delay of the PBP
   was phased from 0% to 90%. Pressures, flows, left ventricular volumes,
   and myocardial oxygen consumption were recorded and cardiac efficiency
   quantified by the ratio of external work (EW) over myocardial oxygen
   consumption. Results: With increasing RBP support, lower left atrial
   pressures (LAP) were found to coincide with a decreased cardiac
   efficiency (r=0.91 +/- 0.12) with a median [inter quartile range] slope
   of 0.28 [0.91] %/mmHg. In contrast, depending on the phase delay of
   ejection of a PBP, LAP and cardiac efficiency follow a sinusoidal course
   with the LAP minimum at 90% and efficiency maximum at 60%. Discussion:
   In RBP support, aggressive ventricular unloading was found to lead to
   lower cardiac efficiencies. On the other side, phasing of a PBP offers
   the possibility to restore cardiac efficiency and simultaneously unload
   the ventricle. These results may justify future studies linking
   optimized cardiac mechanics and efficiency to functional recovery and
   reverse myocardial remodeling with LVAD therapy.
   Objectives: We focused on the interventricular dyssynchrony caused by
   the shortened systole of left ventricle (LV) compared to right ventricle
   (RV) during left ventricular assist device (LVAD) support. The purpose
   of this study was to assess and quantify the mechanical interventricular
   dyssynchorny according to the support condition using conductance
   catheter. Methods: We studied five goats with normal heart condition. A
   centrifugal LVAD was implanted under general anesthesia. We inserted the
   conductance catheter into the LV and RV and obtained the pressure-volume
   relationship. We defined the dyssynchronous status by the sign (plus or
   minus) of the LV volume (LVV) change is opposite to that of RV volume
   (RVV). (i.e., (dLVV/dt)*(dRVV/dt)<0). Interventicular dyssynchrony (DYS)
   was quantified by calculating the percentage of time within the cardiac
   cycle. Bypass rate was set dividing the LVAD pump flow by the main
   pulmonary artery flow. We calculated the DYS under LVAD support with
   various bypass rate. Results: The mean DYS of normal heart, LVAD clamp,
   LVAD support with bypass rate of 50%, 75 % and 100% were 6.0 +/- 1.3,
   8.6 +/- 2.6, 9.6 +/- 1.8, 15.5 +/- 5.6, and 24.6 +/- 8.6, respectively.
   Also, there was a higher linear negative correlation between LV stroke
   volume and DYS. Discussion: Interventricular dyssynchrony during LVAD
   support was assessed and quantified using conductance catheters.
   Dyssynchrony became significant when the LV was unloaded with high
   rotational speed under LVAD support. Assessment of influences for the
   right ventricular function and heart failure models will be studied in
   the further study.
   Objectives: (Bio)chemical modification of implants with drug delivery
   systems can support the body's natural healing capabilities by imitation
   of smooth tissue transitions along bone-tendon conjunctions. Modified
   interconnected 3D porous poly(epsilon-caprolactone) could act as a
   scaffold material for these implants. Methods: Cocontinuous blends of
   poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) and polyethylene oxide (PEO) were
   prepared by batch blending in an internal mixer. Annealing and leaching
   of the blends with water yielded the porous PCL scaffolds, which were
   then modified with chitosan (CS) grafted PCL (CS-g-PCL) via dip coating.
   Nanoparticle systems containing CS and tripolyphosphate (TPP) were
   obtained via ionotropic gelation. These CS-TPP nanoparticles (CSNPs) can
   be attached to the modified scaffolds via a Layer-by-Layer (LbL)
   deposition approach involving alginate (ALG). Results: Interconnected 3D
   porous PCL scaffolds with different morphologies have been prepared.
   Modification with CS-g-PCL, alginate, alginate fluorescein amine
   (ALG-FA), CS-TPP and fluorescein isothiocyanate labelled nanoparticles
   (CS-FITC-TPP) in a LbL approach was carried out. The blank scaffolds
   were analyzed in various ways, including via scanning electron
   microscopy and mercury intrusion porosimetry. Modified versions of the
   scaffolds were analyzed accordingly and the fluorescently labeled
   species were investigated via confocal laser scanning microscopy. CSNPs
   were loaded with bovine serum albumin (BSA) and layered on the modified
   scaffolds. Release of BSA from the scaffolds was investigated by
   ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy at 37 degrees C in phosphate-buffered
   saline (PBS). Discussion: Porous PCL scaffolds with different pore sizes
   and morphologies can be obtained via annealing and leaching of
   cocontinuous PCL/PEO blends. Surface modification with CS-g-PCL,
   alginate and CSNPs open up possibilities regarding graded implant
   fabrication.
   Objectives: Vascular calcification is accelerated and worsened in
   chronic kidney disease (CKD) and dialysis patients compared to the
   general population. Misbalanced phosphate and calcium metabolism plays
   an important role in this health burden in CKD. In this study the role
   of phosphate and calcium in inducing medial vascular calcification is
   researched. Methods: Rat aortic rings were incubated in the normal and
   calcifying mediums for seven days. Three independent experiments, three
   rings per condition in each, were performed (N=9). Normal medium
   consisted of DMEM with 0.9 mM phosphate and 1.8 mM calcium. Calcium
   medium (Ca) consisted of 4.0 mM calcium and 0.9 mM phosphate; phosphate
   medium (P) of 2.8 mM phosphate and 1.8 mM calcium; and calciumphosphate
   medium (Ca+P) of 4.0 mM calcium and 2.8 mM phosphate. Histochemical von
   Kossa staining was performed, and calcification area of a medial and
   adventitial section of the aorta was calculated. The results were
   compared using a two-way ANOVA test. Results: Von Kossa stainings and
   evaluations of the calcified area demonstrated increased calcification
   in aortic rings incubated in different calcification mediums, whereas
   the calcification takes part in different sections of the aorta. Calcium
   alone causes calcification in the adventitia, phosphate alone in the
   medial section of the aorta. Combination of both leads to extensive
   calcification in the adventitia and media. Discussion: In dialysis
   patients, serum calcium levels are maintained quite well, but serum
   phosphate levels may exceed suggested levels multiple times. The results
   of the study demonstrate that high phosphate level is the trigger of
   excessive vascular calcification and the control of levels of phosphate
   in CKD patients is crucially important.
   Objectives: Heterogeneously structured electrospun composite scaffolds
   have performed well as ECM-mimetic tissue replacements in recent years.
   In light of this, we present an assessment of amnion derived multipotent
   stromal cell (aMSC) growth on hybrid polycaprolactone(PCL)-gelatin(G)
   scaffolds in terms of viability, infiltration depth and metabolic
   activity. Methods: Four scaffold types were electrospun (150 mu m thick)
   with different PCL:G ratios and fibre diameter distributions using
   vertical (V) and horizontal (H) orientations - PCL175V (175 mg/ml,
   homogenous), PCL125G50H (125:50 mg/ml, homogeneous), PCL125G50V (125:50
   mg/ml, heterogeneous), PCL100G75V mg/ml (100:75 mg/ml, heterogeneous). A
   7 day live/dead assay and a 15 day infiltration study (depths measured
   using confocal laser scanning microscope) with aMSCs from Callithrix
   jacchus were performed. Metabolic activity was measured by MTT assay (7
   days). Additionally, gelatin loss during scaffold degradation (30 days)
   was measured by Raman spectroscopy. Results: In general, PCL-gelatin
   blends perform better than unblended PCL. PCL125G50V shows the deepest
   cell infiltration on all days (76.3 +/- 7.1 mu m by day 15). It is also
   the only sample that shows an increasing trend in metabolic activity
   from day 1 (0.0436 +/- 0.002) to day 7 (0.0996 +/- 0.009). Raman
   spectroscopy revealed a significant gelatin loss of 53.44 +/- 6.48 % in
   PCL100G75V while PCL125G50V showed no significant loss by day 15.
   Discussion: A combination of heterogeneous fiber morphology and
   composite polymer content in electrospun scaffolds positively affects
   cell growth and infiltration. Considerable gelatin swelling during
   degradation can physically inhibit infiltrating cells. Therefore,
   choosing the right ratio of PCL:gelatin when designing such scaffolds is
   key.
   A total artificial heart is used for orthotopic replacement of the
   native ventricles in cases of irreversible biventricular heart failure
   resulting either from chronic dilated cardiomyopathy or fulminant acute
   myocardial infraction. It is essential to find the right indication.
   There are several surgical options to perform a total artificial heart
   operation. To prevent therapy-failure it essential to set the right
   indication for implanting a total artificial heart. In general therapy
   with a TAH is feasible with good postoperative results. Setting the
   right clinical frame is crucial for the establishment of a therapy
   concept.
   Objectives: Although diabetes is the leading cause of end-stage renal
   disease in many countries, data about its impact on patient-specific
   reaction to haemodialysis (HD) is scarce. Models that allow identifying
   and predicting patient-specific response to HD are in development and
   their improvement is encouraged by clinicians to obtain suitable
   decision support systems (DSS). Here, possible correlations between
   diabetes and alterations in the patient-specific parameters identified
   by a multi-pool, multi-solute model, developed in our laboratory, are
   investigated. Methods: Data acquired during the 'DialysIS' Interreg
   Project (141 patients, 4 centres, 1276 HD) have been used. For each
   patient, a set of specific parameters was identified: one modulates the
   permeability at the capillary wall (rho), the others account for altered
   transport of catabolites and electrolytes at the cellular wall (k(i))
   and at the dialyser membrane (eta(i)), where '(i)' indicates different
   solutes. Patients have been classified as diabetic (D) or not (ND) and
   among Ds, as insulin-dependent (D_ID) or not (D_NID). Initial glucose
   concentrations and identified values of rho, ki, eta i in the different
   groups have been compared using proper statistical tests (p<0.01).
   Results: There were were 37 (26,4%) D patients and 16 of them were D_ID
   (43,2%). Initial plasma glucose concentration statistically differs both
   between D and ND and between D_ID and D_NID patients. Among the
   patient-specific parameters rho, and K-Na, K-Mg, K-Creatinine and
   K-Bicarbonate results were different between D and ND. The values of
   eta(Na), eta(Mg), eta(Ca), eta(Urea) and eta(Creatinine), instead,
   significantly differ between D_ID and D_NID. Discussion:
   Diabetes-induced autonomic and peripheral neuropathies can justify the
   finding of altered capillary wall permeability in D; moreover the use of
   insulin, protein based, seems to impact on the mass transport through
   the dialyzer membrane. The proposed approach allows adding a new tile to
   the studies on how the diabetic pathology affects the response to the HD
   treatment.
   Objectives: Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD) therapy has become an
   accepted treatment for end-stage heart-failure. While patient management
   has improved over the past decades, limitations in caregiver resources
   necessitate efficient allocation. Decisions on the optimal setting of
   LVAD support currently occurs in intervals ranging from a few weeks to a
   few months. However, the optimal setting for LVAD support may change
   multiple times per minute. Thus, automation is the only viable solution
   to this problem. Physiological control promises to integrate the cardiac
   assist device into patient physiology even more closely, reacting to
   varying demands or specifying the load for training of the heart muscle.
   One important design consideration is the choice of feedback variable.
   Methods: Literature of the past two decades was collected and the
   presented physiological control concepts were clustered into categories
   corresponding to functional similarity of feedback variables. Results:
   It was found that most literature could be summarized into five
   categories. Control algorithms either used preload, heart rate,
   ventricular contraction, or afterload as feedback variables or modified
   the flowrate/headpressure relation. Discussion: Each of these categories
   contains information about the cardiac state. While preload variables,
   most closely resemble the native functioning of the left ventricle, they
   are inherently difficult to measure without using additional sensors.
   Chronotropic incompetence might be a limiting factor for heart rate
   based control. Ventricular functioning might fluctuate over time due to
   changes in inotropy while afterload is heavily regulated by other
   autoregulatory mechanisms. The headpressure/flowrate relation suffers
   from uncertainty regarding the origin of pressure changes. Combining
   elements of these five categories into one control concept might prove
   beneficial, as different information could be extracted for the
   controller, which could then be tuned by the physician.
   Objectives: Current understanding of membrane performance in
   hemodialysis implies that their permeability in terms of molecular
   weight cut-off must be restricted to a figure below the molecular weight
   of albumin, i.e. < 60.000. Nephrologists commonly request a maximal
   allowable albumin loss during a 4h treatment to be below 4g per session.
   Methods: Recent investigations have shown that the 3D-conformation of
   albumin is unstable and changes in e.g., uremia or liver failure. Thus,
   detoxification efficiency of albumin may decrease by about 70% and can
   be explained by a considerable reduction of albumin's binding constants
   for both pharmaceutical drugs and uremic retention solutes, as well as
   for exogenous toxins. As a result, free concentrations of such solutes
   increase in patient's blood and a higher toxicity is observed. Binding
   constants for defined uremic retention solutes, such as p-Cresylsulfate,
   are further affected by the simultaneous presence of other solutes, such
   as Indoxylsulfate. Results: Oxidative stress, as manifested in many
   dialysis patients, further promotes changes in albumin conformation.
   It's thus no surprise, that hemodialysis with protein-permeable
   membranes improves patient performance, as shown recently in a clinical
   trial by Nagai et al., (Ther Apher Dial, 2017; 21:378). They reported,
   that in a 7-year observation period, albumin leakage of 3g or more per
   HD session provided a better prognosis than albumin leakage less than
   3g. Obviously, a clinically acceptable large albumin leakage provides
   beneficial effects on maintenance HD patients. Discussion: The
   performance of albumin as an adsorbing protein is inefficient during
   uremia and liver failure. Due to lower binding constants for
   pharma-drugs and uremic toxins following conformational changes in the
   sick state, albumin is unable to perform like in the healthy state. It
   should, thus, be removed. Identification of 3D-changes of albumin and
   thus its removal should become a priority.
   Cataract surgery followed by implantation of an intraocular lens (IOL)
   is one of the most frequently performed surgical procedures in medicine.
   In 2020 alone, there are expected to be 32 million interventions. Here,
   ophthalmologists can look back on 70 years of experience. Since there is
   no blood perfusion at the lens, however, the IOL has a comparatively
   simple immunological special position. Furthermore, the ophthalmologists
   also have extensive experience with implants in the cornea, in the
   chamber angle of the eye and on the retina. In the presentation an
   overview will be given of the current implants and the necessary
   regulatory processes. In addition, own experiences (with medical
   devices) with the new requirements of the MDR will be described.
   Recent evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) suggests that
   post-dilutional haemodiafiltration (HDF) is associated with a benefit in
   survival. This benefit has been mainly observed in re-analyses of the
   primary data looking at the patients treated with the highest convection
   volumes (HCV-HDF). To obtain HCV-HDF, significant pressure has to be
   applied to the dialyser membrane and the dialysis systems are submitted
   to significantly stronger transmembrane pressure (TMP) constraints,
   frequently surpassing the limits proposed by the guidelines. Several
   automatized systems are proposed to avoid or overcome the alarms induced
   by the increases in convection and still maintain the volumes prescribed
   by the physician. The present overview will
   i) Critically analyse the evidence on the effect of convection volumes
   on survival. ii) Review the automatic systems presently proposed to
   achieve a given level of convection. iii) Analyse the possible pitfalls
   in determining the limits established by a dialysis monitor when
   performing HCV-HDF. iv) Explore a harmonised definition of the
   parameters that may drive the convection volumes during a dialysis
   procedure with the aim to help in better defining the Best Practice
   Guidelines for HCV-HDF.
   Objectives: Human Parvovirus B19 (HPV B19) infection is known to cause
   pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) in kidney transplant recipients. We
   investigated the diagnosis and prognosis of HPV B19 infection by urine
   detection in kidney transplant patients with anemia and graft
   dysfunction. Methods: 1195 recipients (living donor/donation after
   citizen's death: 492/703) were performed kidney transplant in our center
   from January 2015 to January 2018. Thirty-six patients diagnosed with
   HPV B19 infection during follow-up (3.01%, 36/1195). Among those,
   fourteen HPV B19 infected patients underwent transplanted kidney biopsy,
   including 12 persons with PRCA and graft dysfunction and 2 recipients
   with donor-derived HPV B19 infection. We collected the urine samples for
   detection of HPV B19 DNA copies at the day of kidney biopsy. Meanwhile,
   the biopsy specimen were studied for immunohistochemical detection by
   using polyclonal mouse Anti-Parvovirus B19 antibody. Results: The mean
   diagnosis time of fourteen HPV B19 infected patients was 44 days
   (7-300days) after transplantation. The reticulocyte percentage was
   0.1-0.2% and the mean hemoglobin level was 67 g/L (51-87 g/L). Among 12
   biopsies with PRCA and graft dysfunction, 6 were diagnosed with T
   cell-mediated rejection (IA-IB-IIA), 3 borderline rejection, 2 without
   rejection signs and 1 was diagnosed with thrombotic microangiopathy
   (TMA). The patient, who was diagnosed with TMA, had performed
   ABO-incompatible kidney transplantation. It displayed glomerular
   microthrombus and diffuse necrosis of renal tubules on renal biopsy.
   Despite the treatment of IVIG, the graft was ultimately lost. The
   immunohistochemical result of the TMA biopsy specimen was positive and
   the others were negative. The result of urine detection for HPV B19
   virus DNA copies was >10 boolean AND 5/ml with TMA and the others were
   negative. Discussion: If the urine test is positive for HPV B19 DNA,
   parvovirus -associated kidney injury should be suspected.
   Hemodynamic simulations are increasingly used to assess the flow
   phenomena in intracranial aneurysms (IAs). Based on detailed simulation
   results existing therapies such as coiling or stenting can be improved
   or novel approaches are tested. However, the accuracy of
   patient-specific blood flow acquisitions strongly depends on preliminary
   and highly interdisciplinary steps. These include for instance medical
   imaging, image reconstruction, image segmentation and acquisition of
   appropriate boundary conditions. To assess capabilities, but also
   limitations of state-of-art IA modeling techniques, international
   simulation challenges are frequently organized. These comparisons
   address single or combined steps along the simulation process. Within
   this talk, the most relevant competitions are presented and the main
   findings are summarized. In this regard, sources of error in the context
   of hemodynamic modeling are revealed and the awareness for standardized
   simulations is sharpened.
   Objectives: Heart failure (HF) is a critical healthcare issue and a
   primary source of cardiovascular mortality worldwide. Globally, it is
   estimated that up to 100,000 people are candidates for heart
   transplantation, but only about 5800 transplants were performed in 2016.
   At Cleveland Clinic, we are developing a continuous-flow total
   artificial heart (CFTAH) in an attempt to provide a viable alternative
   to transplantation for the growing population of patients with end-stage
   HF. Methods: The Cleveland Clinic CFTAH is a double-ended centrifugal
   pump with only one moving part that is designed to passively
   self-balance left and right circulations without active intervention.
   The device has no mechanical bearings to wear out and is driven by an
   extremely reliable 3-phase brushless, sensorless motor. The nominal
   external dimensions of the latest version of our adult CFTAH design to
   be tested in-vivo were 98.4 mm in length, 62 mm in diameter, 160 cc in
   volume displacement and 486 g in weight without the cable. Results:
   Biocompatibility of the CFTAH has been demonstrated in two full-term
   90-day in vivo tests, completed without the use of any anticoagulation.
   Since the conclusion of these tests, our team has been working on design
   improvements to further reduce susceptibility to thrombosis, enhance
   autoregulation, improve motor controller hardware, add clinically useful
   features to the control interface and enhance manufacturability.
   Discussion: Our results to date suggest that a small, mechanically and
   electronically simple, auto-regulated total artificial heart has
   significant potential to provide an important clinical option for HF
   patients.
   We discuss a novel method for hemolysis prediction in computational
   fluid dynamics, which avoids potential problems inherent to the
   traditionally used Eulerian and Lagrangian methods. The traditionally
   used Eulerian method computes a hemolysis index (HI) at the flow outlet
   by solving a transport partial differential equation (PDE) where the
   source term equals shear stress raised to some power (which is
   determined empirically), and then looks at the HI transported to the
   flow outlet. The largest contribution to HI typically occurs at the flow
   boundaries (walls), which is precisely the location where numerical
   noise is most likely to be inadvertently introduced, e.g., from sharp
   edges in the wall or from low quality mesh elements. This can cause
   errors in the Eulerian method because its PDE lacks a diffusion term,
   and consequently any numerical noise is transported to, and accumulates
   at, the flow outlet surface. We have not seen this potential problem
   occurring when using a Lagrangian method, although theoretically it
   could still occur. Regardless, a major disadvantage of the Lagrangian
   method is a large computational cost required to achieve reasonable
   accuracy. Instead of using one of the two traditional methods, we use a
   volume integral where the source term includes both shear stress and
   flow speed. In situations with sufficient mixing, such as in an LVAD,
   this approach predicts blood damage at least as well as either of the
   other methods, for a fraction of the computational cost, and avoids the
   numerical problems. The method also lends itself better to frozen rotor
   simulations, while the traditional methods prefer more costly
   time-dependent simulations. We present an example where the method is
   used to evaluate potential changes to a HM3-like rotor design.
   Objectives: A great and long pursued goal in cancer research is the
   development of a suitable culture system for expanding haematopoietic
   stem cells (HSCs), which can thereafter be successfully used in
   transplantations. Since HSCs only reproduce in their natural
   environment, novel systems try to mimic the in vivo niche of HSCs, the
   bone marrow, in many factors such as material rigidity, chemical and
   cellular compositions. Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) are known
   to support HSC expansion. This effect is even greater when the cells are
   cocultured in a 3D environment. The aim of this project is to study the
   interactions of HSCs and MSCs in a conventional 2D culture compared with
   a 3D porous hydrogel, which was previously developed in our group.
   Methods: The influence of HSCs on MSCs and vice versa will be studied on
   a transcriptomic level by next generation sequencing and verified by
   qPCR, cytokine arrays and western blots. To regain the cells from the
   system we want to make our hydrogel degradable by introducing disulfide
   bonds, which can be cleaved by reducing agents. Afterwards the RNA will
   be fixed within the cells and these will be separated by magnetic cell
   sorting, previous to RNA isolation. Results: Previous experiments
   indicate that the 3D system has a positive effect on HSCs only in
   coculture with MSCs. With a deep insight into the transcriptomes of both
   cell types in coculture, we hope to identify key molecules playing a
   role in this phenomenon and in HSC expansion. Such key molecules shall
   further be tested for their influence on the coculture by inhibition or
   enhancement. Discussion: The HSC expansion in vitro while maintaining
   their stem cell character has been a major and challenging goal in
   research for more than 60 years. By finding and influencing key
   molecules of the HSC-MSC interaction, we hope to further develop our 3D
   hydrogel system and increase HSC expansion in vitro.
   Objectives: Small molecule drugs can be bound to plasma proteins.
   Examples are Apixaban (459 Da, 87% protein bound), Carvedilol (406 Da,
   98% protein bound) or Calcitriol (416 Da, 99.9 % protein bound). In
   plasma, these drugs have a free and a protein bound fraction. Protein
   binding impacts the removal behavior of the drug during dialysis. The
   purpose of this work was to develop a quantitative model to describe the
   removal of these solutes, and validate the model experimentally.
   Methods: A mathematical model was developed by coupling the equations of
   transport in dialyzers reported in one of our previous studies, and mass
   balance equations reported in literature to include the effect of
   binding. Simulated HD treatments with human plasma were performed with 3
   different types of commercial dialyzers having different membrane
   permeability to study the removal of Apixaban, Carvedilol or Calcitriol,
   expressed in terms of solute clearance. Additionally, the loss of
   albumin was quantified. Results: Experimental clearance results [ml/min]
   are given as mean +/- MAD from 3 independent experiments in the order of
   Apixaban / Carvedilol / Calcitriol. Calculated values are reported in
   brackets. Dialyzer 1 was tested in HDF mode, yielding clearance of 60
   +/- 1.0 [61] / 41 +/- 1.8 [10]/ < 6 [0.5]. Dialyzer 2 tested in HD mode
   yielded clearance of 60 +/- 1.6[ 60] / 31 +/- 1.6 [10] / Discussion:
   Clearance of tested drugs was lower than expected for their nominal
   molecular weight. The levels scaled Apixaban > Carvedilol >> Calcitriol,
   which is inverse to their degree of protein binding (Apixaban <
   Carvedilol << Calcitriol). The degree of protein binding was revealed to
   be the actual critical determinant, rather than dialyzer design and
   operational mode. Drug clearance seemed to be driven by the proportion
   of the free fractions, as is reflected in the model by the increase of
   clearance for decreasing bound fraction.
   Objectives: In the development of biocompatible materials for biomedical
   applications, the foreign body response is an important issue. The
   healing of surrounding tissue often interferes with the function of an
   implanted biomaterial. Events like protein deposition, hemostasis,
   inflammation, tissue repair, infections and the encapsulation of the
   functional part of the implant are the main cause of failure of the
   implanted device. Methods: In this study biocompatible nanofilms are
   produced by means of a plasma polymerization process using a
   low-pressure magnetron-enhanced 15 kHz glow discharge. This process
   allows the precise control of the film nature and behaviour. The
   resulting hydrocarbon film has a thickness of a few nanometer and keeps
   therefore the inherent properties of the substrate material.
   Measurements on protein adsorption gave the possibility to tailor the
   thin films in the needed direction. This means to tailor a native
   secondary structure of in situ adsorbed proteins. Results: The nanofilms
   were investigated using different surface analytical methods. Also the
   interaction in contact with different biological sample materials was
   tested in-vitro. The precise measurement of the adsorbed proteins
   indicated a native secondary structure of proteins on these surfaces.
   Different in-vivo sensor dummies which are in contact with blood and
   soft-tissue were coated by these nanofilms. The explanted sensors were
   kept free of any encapsulation by this coating. This stands in good
   correlation with the measurement of adsorbed proteins. Discussion: The
   first in-vitro results of the adsorption of blood proteins indicated
   already a very biocompatible character of these nanofilms. The explanted
   sensors were kept free of any encapsulation by this coating. These
   coatings can open the door for many new applications in the field of new
   implants but also other biomedical products.
   Objectives: Human placenta tissue has great advantages to be used as
   tissue source due to its molecular composition and its availability as
   clinical waste product. In our previous studies, human placenta arteries
   were decellularized and showed low immunogenicity and a supportive
   environment for cell migration and proliferation. Decellularized
   extracellular matrix (ECM) hydrogels are a widely-used tool in the field
   of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. To create placental ECM
   hydrogel (pECM-HG) decellularized arterial grafts were further processed
   by an enzymatic pepsin digestion. Methods: pECM-HG were biochemically
   analyzed. Scanning electron microscopy was used to visualize fiber
   structures. Cell adherence and migration assays were carried out on
   pECM-HG coated culture plates to confirm cytocompatibility of the
   material. As next step pECM-HG was used for coating of vascular grafts
   in a reseeding experiment using a perfused 3D bioreactor system.
   Furthermore, biomechanical properties of 3D hydrogels were tested by
   rheological measurements. Results: pECM-HG showed low amount of DNA
   residuals and preservation of cell interacting ECM proteins. SEM
   analysis revealed the formation of specific fibrous structures,
   dependent on respective hydrogel concentration. Cell binding and
   viability assays showed significantly enhanced cell adherence and
   increased proliferation rates when seeded on surfaces coated with
   pECM-HG (p<0.001) compared to controls. pECM-HG showed beneficial
   properties for cell reseeding on acellular vascular grafts in a flow
   bioreactor system. Discussion: We developed a hydrogel from human
   vascular tissue that is cytocompatible and supports cell adherence and
   proliferation. We hypothesize that this hydrogel has great potential due
   to its origin and composition. Further investigations on the hydrogel
   composition are ongoing. It is planned use the pECM-HG for 3D cell
   printing applications or as injectable hydrogel to support ischemic
   injury regeneration.
   Objectives: Intra-aortic Balloon Pump (IABP) is undoubtedly the most
   widely used mechanical circulatory support system for a range of severe
   heart failure indications. Average duration of IABP use is 1-3 days,
   however its longer-term use has not been adequately studied. The
   objective of this work is to establish the extent to which the IABP
   duration has been used, and also to examine the clinical outcome
   pertaining to prolonged use of IABP, using meta-analysis of literature
   data. Methods: We defined IABP prolonged use as 7 days or longer; a
   choice based on a duration that is greater than double the current
   perceived average use. We systematically reviewed the literature
   (Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science) and identified 14 studies that have
   prolonged IABP use between 1968 - 2018. Patients indications included
   heart failure (refractory, congestive, end stage), ventricular
   arrhythmia, myocardial infarction and cardiogenic shock. Results: A
   total number of 1707 patients of both genders received prolonged IABP
   use with an overall average of 22.6 days. The studied cohort is split
   into: Group 1: n= 1683 adults, mean age 57.9 years, range 19-84 years
   old, average use of 21.2 days. Survival rate in this group was 64.4%.
   Group 2: n=24 infants and children, mean age 5.5 years, range 7
   days-17.5 years old, average use 24 days. Overall mean survival rate to
   discharge was 62.5%. At a mean follow-up of 85 months, all 15 survivors
   were alive and well. Discussion: Due to its ease of insertion and
   relative low cost, IABP presents the first port of call in a wide range
   of heart failure scenarios. This analysis indicates that, age does not
   seem to be a significant parameter that affect outcomes of IABP
   long-term use. Although, IABP is perceived to be only a short-term
   support, its prolonged use is evident with successful outcomes. Further
   trials of IABP long-term use for children and adults is warranted to
   further establish the range of indications IABP can be utilised as a
   long-term support.
   Objectives: Human serum albumin (HSA), one of the dominating proteins in
   human plasma with its exceptional binding capacity plays an important
   role in storing and transporting different substances throughout the
   human circulatory system. Clinically used to treat a variety of
   diseases, particularly in liver failure therapy, pharmaceutical-grade
   HSA contains high amounts of stabilizers, such as Na-caprylate and
   N-acetyltryptophanate. These compounds represent potential risks to
   patients with restricted liver function. The aim of this study was to
   test if the elimination of stabilizers by adsorbent technique affects
   HSA's secondary structure. Methods: Albumin infusion solutions (BIOMED,
   Germany) were filtered using a commercial system Hepalbin (Albutec,
   Germany). Raman- and FTIR spectroscopy as well as DSC analysis were
   applied to analyze conformational changes in treated and untreated HSA
   samples. For Raman based studies different parameters such as object
   slides type, integration time, accumulations number and laser capacity
   were investigated. Results: Preliminarily results of the
   physical-chemical analyses showed some differences for filtered samples
   in comparison to the unfiltered ones. Raman and FTIR spectra exhibited
   both, peak shifts in characteristic HSA amide bands and an alteration in
   the peaks' shape. DSC thermograms revealed significant differences in
   denaturation temperatures of the compared samples. Discussion: A Raman
   shift in amide I band and changes in the alpha-helix/beta-sheet ratio
   detected via FTIR spectroscopy indicated a possible alteration in the
   HSA conformation after filtration. These findings were corroborated by
   DCS showing a tendency towards lower denaturation temperatures in
   samples after stabilizers removal. The results may contribute to finding
   a compromise between stability and high functional performance of HSA
   for the improvement of liver failure therapy.
   Objectives: The protein fibrinogen is important in blood coagulation and
   wound healing. Hence, nanofibrous fibrinogen scaffolds are highly
   attractive as biomaterials. One currently used technique to prepare
   fibrinogen nanofibers in vitro is electrospinning. Since this technique
   uses organic solvents and high electric fields, which can impede the
   biological protein function, we have developed a novel technique to
   prepare fibrinogen scaffolds with physiological buffers. Methods: We
   introduced the novel method of salt-induced self assembly under
   controlled drying conditions to prepare nanofibrous fibrinogen
   scaffolds. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis was used to
   characterize the fiber morphology. We studied the secondary structure
   with Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. To assess the
   biocompatibility of our novel scaffolds we analyzed the proliferation of
   3T3 mouse fibroblasts with WST1 assays and studied the cell morphology
   with SEM. Results: Salt-induced self assembly reproducibly yielded
   fibrinogen nanofibers with overall scaffold dimensions in the centimeter
   range. SEM analysis revealed fiber diameters between 200 and 300 nm. By
   adding a customized fixation step after the fiber formation we
   fabricated either immobilized or free-standing fibrinogen networks
   depending on the underlying substrate material. With FTIR spectroscopy
   we found a higher content of beta-sheet structures for fibrinogen
   nanofibers in comparison to planar fibrinogen. 3T3 fibroblasts were
   found to proliferate well on fibrinogen nanofibers with cell numbers
   comparable to planar fibrinogen substrates. SEM analysis showed that 3T3
   fibroblasts grew in close contact with fibrinogen nanofibers.
   Discussion: Our new self assembly process offers a well controllable and
   physiological biofabrication method for large-scale fibrinogen
   scaffolds. Based on the good biocompatibility results our fibrinogen
   networks are very promising candidates for a new class of wound
   dressings.
   Total artificial hearts (TAH) are used to restore quality of life to
   biventricular heart failure patients but can also introduce significant
   risks. Several features were included in to the BiVACOR design to
   mitigate some of the major risks, such as 1) device malfunction, 2)
   insufficient hemocompatibility, 3) ineffective physiological
   interaction, and 4) inappropriate device geometry. To achieve a durable
   design the BiVACOR TAH reduces mechanical wear by levitating a single
   rotating impeller in a magnetic field. To reduce the incidence of single
   fault failures, the levitation and drive systems incorporate backup
   features. Large clearance gaps in the blood flow path and cyclic speed
   variations assist hemocompatibility. Physiological interaction is
   improved via autonomous left/right outflow balancing, the ability to
   inherently adapt total outflow based on physiological conditions, and to
   respond to variations in filling volumes. Initial durability testing is
   ongoing with no device failures after 180 days. The redundant motor and
   hydrodynamic backup bearing maintain hemodynamic function when failure
   modes are induced. Preliminary NIH, platelet activation and vWF
   degradation during in-vitro tests show lower levels than implantable
   VADs. In-vivo results (1x90day, 3x30-day) confirm benchtop observations.
   When operated with either pulsatile or non-pulsatile outflow up to 15
   l/min, or with the hydrodynamic backup bearing, pfHb ranged between
   0.5-2mg/dL. The system can balance outflows under a wide variety of
   physiological conditions, while inherently adjusting flows by more than
   4 l/min. Finally, device weight and size allowed a good anatomical fit
   in human cadavers with BSA >1.4m(2). By implementing the risk mitigating
   design features, the BiVACOR device aims to provide patients with a
   durable, hemocompatible, and physiological interactive TAH with suitable
   anatomical fit. Successful development of this device may ultimately
   lead to a long-term alternative to heart transplants.
   Objectives: Visualization of hemodynamics often represents a
   simplification of blood as a monophasic fluid. In this study, blood is
   used as a multiphase fluid. The aim is to fabricate artificial blood to
   visualize hemodynamics with Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). More
   specific, micro beads (ArtErys), which mimic the erythrocytes, are
   fabricated with a membrane-emulsion-technology system (MET). This system
   is developed and compared with the results (e.g. ArtEry size) of three
   other methods: microfluidic, electro-spraying and air flow. Methods: The
   ArtErys are made of hydrogels (Agarose 0.3-0.7 wt.%) to match refractive
   index and biomechanics. For PIV tracking, particles (Sphericals (c), 20
   mu m) are encapsulated directly into the ArtErys and are not added to
   the plasma where they might affect the hemodynamics. For the MET system,
   different oils (e.g. paraffin) are used as disperse phase. The
   Agarose/PIV mixture is pumped (50 to 100 ml/h) into a constant oil flow
   (5 to 40 ml/h) through a PTFE membrane (Reichelt Chemietchnik GmbH, pore
   size 60 mu m). The ArtErys are created during this process and
   transported away by the oil. The MET process is carried out in a heated
   water bath with a temperature of 55 degrees C. Results: The ArtEry size
   depends mainly on two parameters: the flow rate of the agarose/PIV
   solution and the flow rate of the oil. A flow rate of 80 ml/h
   Agarose/PIV solution leads to smallest bead sizes with a mean diameter
   of 150 mu m. High rates lead to merging of the ArtErys, which is
   reflected in a larger diameter. Furthermore, the bead size depends on
   the parameter oil flow rate. Here, a rate of 30 ml/h leads to the
   smallest beads. Discussion: The MET method has been successfully
   implemented to fabricate ArtErys with encapsulated PIV particles.
   Compared to the other methods, the MET system fabricates the biggest
   ArtEry sizes (MET: 150 mu m, microfluidic: 15 mu m, electro-spraying: 80
   mu m, air flow: 100 mu m).
   Objectives: Since the latest revision of the Medical Devices (MDs)
   Directive, the European regulatory framework considers stand-alone
   software as a MD per se, as confirmed by the MD Regulation. The recent
   surge of AI tools, which promise to be ubiquitous soon, poses problems
   relative to their certification as MDs. In view of the already granted
   market approval in Europe and the USA for some AI-based MDs, we aimed to
   investigate the main relevant issues of such MDs' regulation. Methods:
   Unlike traditional SW as MDs, for which established standards already
   exist (e.g., IEC 62304, "Software life-cycle processes"), for AI tools
   there are very few specific standards. The definition of AI, or
   intelligence itself, is by no means universally accepted. Thus, we
   limited the scope of AI to Machine/Deep Learning (ML/DL). Results: 1)
   ML/DL tools are data intensive, so that a critical issue is how to
   construct a representative set of input data. E.g., IEC 62304 recommends
   that the manufacturer include software system inputs and outputs, in the
   SW requirements: this is clearly too generic for a DL tool. 2)
   Guidelines for acceptable input data size should be drawn, for a given
   system/software architecture. Moreover, quality check of training data
   should always be executed, before SW training. Quality of ML/DL tools
   and of physical architecture is also relevant. 3) Generally, DL tools
   lack an explicit declarative knowledge representation, hence it is
   difficult or impossible to assess to "reasoning" behind the algorithmic
   decisions. "Explainable" AI should be the standard, in order to rule out
   fuzziness in machine clinical decision making and impossibility to
   pinpoint the problem(s), in view of the legal responsibility for MD use.
   It has been found that DL performance conflicts with explainability,
   thus priority setting will be crucial. Discussion: The regulatory
   treatment of AI-based MDs needs improvements, in order to have safe and
   effective products, as well as wider societal acceptance.
   Objectives: The aim of this work is to design a reliable and efficient
   sheath for an implantable part of a device for the wireless inductive
   powering of artificial organs. Methods: Wireless inductive power
   transfer can help get rid of the problems of recharge and wired constant
   power supply to artificial organs. However, the design of the
   implantable part of the transcutaneous powering device, or so-called
   assembly, is complicated by the lack of a comprehensive solution of
   technical and medical problems. The assembly must be encapsulated in the
   sheath which requires the choice of a biocompatible and non-magnetic
   material. This eliminates the formation of eddy currents on the sheath,
   whereby negative influence on the energy transfer is minimized. At the
   same time, the material should have a low thermal conductivity (about
   0.5 W / (m . K)) to prevent overheating of the tissue from the
   circuitry. The sheath of the assembly must have sufficient durability to
   protect the circuitry. The form-factor of the sheath should be minimized
   for the convenience of the patient (dimensions in the limit of 20 x 20 x
   3 mm). Results: The sheath was developed for the assembly prototype. The
   assembly provides an output power in the range 0.45 horizontal ellipsis
   0.55 W for the axial distance between the coils in the range 10
   horizontal ellipsis 20 mm and the lateral misalignment up to 20 mm. The
   calculation and measurement were performed in the air and with the
   samples of "skin-fat" biological objects, in order to determine and
   verify the sheath characteristics. Discussion: We have developed and
   tested the assembly's sheath for inductive powering of artificial organs
   that meets technical and medical requirements.
   Objectives: Magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) are used in medicine for
   targeted drug delivery to the area of cancer. There is the problem of
   remotely determining in vivo concentrations of MNPs. The aim of our work
   was to experimentally test acoustomagnetic method (AMM) for detecting
   MNPs in a model sample of a biological substance (BS). Methods: A
   colloidal solution of Fe3O4 nanoparticles in a mixture of oleic acid and
   kerosene was used as a model sample. The weight concentration of the
   MNPs in the solution was 0.15%, and the viscosity of the solution was
   close to the blood viscosity. To detect MNPs in solution, a special
   experimental setup was developed. The installation consists of an
   ultrasound generator, a permanent magnet, a glass container with a
   solution, an induction multi-turn coil near the glass tube, and a
   voltmeter as a measure of the voltage across the coil. Ultrasound causes
   periodic movement of the particles of the solution together with the
   MNPs along the container axis. The magnet orients the MNPs in the
   direction perpendicular to the axis of the container. As a result, the
   summation of MNPs creates an alternating magnetic field with an
   ultrasonic frequency in the coil area. An alternating voltage (U) arises
   on the coil, as measured by a voltmeter. Results: As measurements have
   shown, the magnitude of the voltage is proportional to the concentration
   of MNPs in the field of action of the ultrasound and the magnet field,
   as well as the intensity of the ultrasound. In particular, when the
   intensity of ultrasound was at the level of 0.02 W/ cm2, U = 1mV was
   obtained. Discussion: The experimental results are consistent with the
   calculated estimates and suggest that AMM can be used to detect MNPs in
   a real BS. Considering that the magnitude of the constant magnetic field
   in these experiments was 0.1T, we can also conclude that this method is
   safe, more accurate, and easier to implement than traditional X-ray and
   MRT methods.
   Objectives: For a single hemodialysis session several hundred liters of
   water are consumed. Water scarcity and inadequate water purification
   facilities worsen contamination risk especially in developing countries.
   Here, we investigate the application of a mixed matrix membrane (MMM),
   which combines filtration and adsorption, for achieving endotoxin-free
   dialysate combined to high removal of uremic toxins from human plasma.
   Methods: We investigate the adsorption of lipo-polysacharide (LPS) by a
   MMM in both static and dynamic conditions. Dynamic adsorption of LPS is
   also investigated in presence of uremic toxins in human plasma.
   Diffusion experiments using dialysate contaminated with bacterial
   culture filtrates are also performed to assess the ability of the MMM to
   act as a safety-barrier to avoid transfer of pyrogens to the plasma. A
   membrane without sorbents is used as control and the obtained results
   are compared with literature studies using current dialysis membranes.
   Results: The MMM can remove approximately 10 times more endotoxins from
   dialysate compared to commercial dialysis membranes. No transfer of
   pyrogens was detected in the blood compartment, revealing safety-barrier
   properties of the MMM. Importantly, endotoxins from dialysate and
   protein-bound toxins from human plasma can be removed simultaneously
   without compromising AC adsorption capacity. Discussion: We estimate
   that 0.15 m(2)of MMM is needed to remove the daily production of the
   protein-bound toxins, indoxyl sulfate and hippuric acid and to
   completely remove endotoxins in a wearable artificial kidney (WAK)
   device. Future studies would focus on the applicability of the MMM in
   wearable/portable artificial kidneys and in general for
   home-hemodialysis treatments.
   Objectives: Nearly half of all heart failure patients suffer from heart
   failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). With no effective
   treatment, a major clinical need is presented. The aim of this study was
   the hemo - and fluid dynamic investigation of a valveless pulsatile pump
   for HFpEF using in-vitro, ex-vivo, computational fluid dynamic (CFD),
   and 4D flow MRI imaging studies. Methods: The pump is a pneumatically
   driven pulsatile pump with a single valveless cannula that is to be
   implanted through the LV apex and is operated synchronously with the
   left ventricle. A prototype of the proposed pump system was fabricated.
   The pump was tested in an in-vitro hybrid mock loop system to evaluate
   its hemodynamic effect in four HFpEF phenotypes. Further hemodynamic
   evaluation was conducted by implanting the pump in an ex-vivo isolated
   heart model. CFD was employed for flow field analysis of two different
   pump designs-a symmetric and an asymmetric configuration. The results
   were validated by 4D flow MRI imaging of the respective prototypes.
   Results: In the in-vitro studies, the pump augmented cardiac output (CO)
   by 14 - 30% and reduced left atrial pressure (LAP) by 14 - 30%. Ex-vivo
   studies showed the similar hemodynamic trends: augmented CO by 20.0 +/-
   9.7%, and reduced LAP by 57.5 +/- 14.4%. Fluid dynamic simulations
   revealed good correlation with the respective 4D flow measurements. The
   asymmetric configuration disclosed superior fluid dynamic performance
   with 94.5% of the initial blood being exchanged after 3 beats.
   Discussion: It was demonstrated that the valveless pulsatile device can
   improve hemodynamics in HFpEF patients by augmenting CO and reducing
   LAP. Appropriate washout of the pump chamber is achieved by a persisting
   vortex evolving within the asymmetric design throughout each pump cycle.
   By demonstrating the hemodynamic effects and promising fluid dynamic
   performance of the pump, feasibility of the system as a potential
   treatment option for HFpEF patients is supported.
   Objectives: In this work, the denaturation behaviour of bovine serum
   albumin (BSA) in single wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) aqueous
   nanodispersions during heating was analyzed using differential scanning
   calorimetry. Thermodynamic effects of BSA interaction with SWCNTs have
   been discussed. The calculation procedure for estimating the parameters
   of laser treatment on the basis of differential scanning calorimetry
   data is presented. Accurate calculation of the optimal parameters of
   laser treatment, under which there is complete denaturation of albumin
   and the solid nanocomposite material is forming, will minimize the
   thermal damage of the connected tissues, while not reducing the tensile
   strength of the seam. Methods: Laser solders based on water dispersion
   of BSA (25 % w/w) and SWCNTs (0, 0.1, 0.01 and 0.001 % w/w) were used
   for differential scanning calorimetry study. Studies were conducted in
   hermetically sealed crucibles with heating rates of 3, 5, 10 and 20
   degrees C/min. Results: The specific energies and denaturation
   temperatures of the laser solders were measured. The use of SWCNTs led
   to a decrease in the specific energy of denaturation from 4.11 to 3.27
   J/g and a denaturation temperature from 87.2 to 86.9 degrees C. The
   activation energy of albumin denaturation in laser solder has doubled
   during use SWCNTs Discussion: Thermodynamic effects of BSA interaction
   with SWCNTs have been discussed, namely the changes in temperature
   characteristics of denaturation processes and the partial thermal
   destabilization of albumin. The energetic parameters of laser treatment
   have been estimated on the basis of differential scanning calorimetry
   data. The values obtained are optimal for complete BSA denaturation
   resulting in formation of solid nanocomposite material with minimal
   thermal damage of the connected tissues and sufficient tensile strength
   of the seam.
   Objectives: Clot formation in the membrane oxygenator is a serious
   complication in long-term extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). In
   the blood vessels, nitric oxide (NO) generated by nitric oxide synthase
   on the endothelial cells suppresses both aggregation/activation of
   platelets and adhesion/activation of leukocytes. Therefore,
   biocompatibility of the membrane oxygenator may be improved by the
   addition of NO gas to the sweep gas. The objective of the present study
   was to determine, using a rat ECMO model, whether addition of NO gas to
   the blood can suppress blood coagulation. Methods: Male Sprague Dawley
   rats weighing 350 to 400 g were used for the experiments. After the rats
   were anesthetized, extracorporeal circulation was established by guiding
   the blood from the right jugular vein into the left femoral vein.
   Heparin was administered by bolus injection (0.7 unit/g-rat) only at the
   start of the ECMO. Polymethyl pentene membranes were used for the
   oxygenator. The sweep gas (NO: 0, 100 or 200 ppm, O2: 30%, CO2: 5%, N2:
   balance) was added to the blood via the oxygenator. During the
   experiment, the arterial pressure, oxygenator inlet pressure, venous
   pressure, activated whole blood clotting time (ACT), and methemoglobin
   (Met-Hb) concentration were measured. After circulation, the hemoglobin
   (Hb) content and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity in the eluate from
   the residual blood in the oxygenator were measured. Results:
   Extracorporeal circulation was stably performed for 4 hours. There were
   no differences in the ACT during the experiment among the three groups.
   The amount of Met-Hb was below 10% in the NO group. The Hb content and
   LDH activity in the eluate were significantly lower in the 200-ppm NO
   group than those in the 0 ppm NO. Discussion: The amount of Met-Hb in
   the NO group indicates that there is no adverse effect related to
   Met-Hb. The Hb content and LDH activity indicate that the NO contained
   in the sweep gas inhibited blood coagulation in this rat extracorporeal
   circulation model.
   Objectives: Data from the WAA apheresis registry was investigated
   regarding patients treated with extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) as a
   tool to modulate immune response in various diseases. Methods: 381
   patients (34% women) had been treated with ECP for a total of 10668
   procedures. The mean age was 48 years (+/- 18, range 3-81 years).
   Estimation of quality of life was made using grade 0 (suicidal) up to 10
   (best ever) and health quality grade 1 (Bed ridden, ICU condition) up to
   10 (athletic). Adverse events were analyzed. ANOVA comparisons were
   used. Results: Most patients were treated due to graft versus host
   disease (GVHD, n=284) and other hematological diseases (n=34). Adverse
   events were registered in 5.8% of the first treatments and in 2.1% of
   the subsequent procedures. Severe adverse events were present in 0.4% of
   all procedures. No patient died due to the procedure. Tingling and
   stitching were the most common side effects. For those with GVHD the QoL
   was initially at a mean 6.3 (+/- 1.5, range 2-10) and improved
   significantly within 10 procedures and the Health Condition estimate
   improved significantly within 9 procedures and improved further with
   added procedures. Discussion: Photopheresis is an established therapy
   with few side effects. The present data indicate that approximately 10
   procedures are necessary to note significant effect to GVHD.
   Objectives: The most fundamental goal in improving quality of care in
   hospitals is to eliminate unnecessary deaths. AIM: Three-year mortality
   and quality of care between 2015-2017 were evaluated in a tertiary
   nephrology clinic. Methods: Audit of 392 deaths was carried out to
   reveal prevalence of suboptimal clinical observations. Admission
   pressure, direct admissions avoiding public healthcare system, severity
   of clinical conditions, elderly persons dying in the hospital, time of
   admissions and death were evaluated. Results: In 2015 and 2016, 5.5 of
   every 100 inpatients died in the hospital, and this proportion decreased
   to 4.9 in 2017, with high percentage of patients who died in the first
   24 or 48 hours from admission. The percentage of hospital deaths
   occurring in combination with AKI rose from 17% up to 37% over the
   three-year study period. Many patients who died with worsening CKD, were
   not ever referred to a nephrologist. More than half of patients were
   admitted on duty and died over weekends. About 5% of the hospital deaths
   were among patients aged 85 and over, and in 2017 that number rose up to
   10%. Patients who died were seriously ill, at least 17% had malignancy.
   Most of the cardiovascular deaths were directly caused by ischemic
   stroke. Discussion: In this study we did not find patients with
   preventable deaths. The results indicated that patients were seriously
   ill, elderly, some being admitted to hospital to die. Some of the
   patients were kept long period prior to death because of shortage on
   certain facilities. There is admission pressure and other external
   factors contributing to high burden in treatment of the dying patients.
   Still, further effors are necessary for further providing and auditing
   health quality of care.
   Objectives: Human immune cells have been produced using Advanced Therapy
   Medicinal Products (ATMP) guidelines and have been tested in clinical
   studies for a number of diseases, for which still no or only inadequate
   alternative therapies are available. Examples include several cancer
   entities, stroke, myocardial infarction, severe autoimmune disorders and
   chronic infections. Despite many in vitro or in animal studies report
   positive outcomes after immune cell therapy, convincing results showing
   the benefits of ATMP in clinical studies are rare. Part of this
   discrepancy in the outcome of the clinical studies in comparison to the
   in vitro and in animal studies may be caused by the manufacturing of
   immune cells for clinical trials. Cells prepared for clinical trials
   were mostly manufactured using archaic, scarcely controlled and
   incomparable production processes and stringent analytical methods for
   assessing proliferation and differentiation of the immune cells during
   the manufacturing process were not applied. Methods: The production of
   ATMPs is first of all dependent on the donor specific biology, which
   significantly varies from one donor or patient, respectively, to another
   (biological heterogeneity). In case of immune cell therapy, the
   manufacturing process is key for cytotoxic function and is the basis for
   the biological activity of the cells after injection into the patient.
   Results: The challenge for future clinical trials therefore is to
   reproducibly provide a sufficient number of biologically active cells of
   appropriate quality preferably in accordance with quality manufacturing
   guidelines (e. g. Good Manufacturing Practice, ICH etc.). Only using
   cells which have been produced under these rigorous quality control
   regimes will allow the conduction of clinically meaningful trials.
   Discussion: The talk presents a survey and discusses consequences on
   future requirements for manufacturing processes of products for immune
   cell therapies.
   Objectives: Cryopreservation plays a major role in the storage of
   tissues that are kept for subsequent transplantation. A wide variety of
   tissues intended for transplantation for a patient are stored in this
   way. In addition to the assignment to a suitable recipient, it must be
   ensured in particular that a sufficiently long period of time is
   available for infection diagnostic analyses. Cryopreservation of tissue
   is therefore routine in everyday tissue medicine. Methods: As is well
   known, the success of low temperature storage depends in particular on
   coordinated freezing and storage processes, in the optimization of which
   many research approaches have already been investigated. In contrast to
   these well-known principles of important parameter adjustment in this
   context, little attention is paid to optimizing the freezing process in
   the daily routine of tissue medicine. In fact, for some applications the
   suboptimal storage of tissue is not critical, as no vital cells are
   necessary or desired. Results: This reduces the process to a minimum and
   eliminates the need for additives such as cryoprotective agent (CPA) or
   animal/human serum. This is particularly important for tissue
   preparations which, as in Germany, require a medicinal product approval
   by a competent authority. Any change to the process must be first
   approved by the competent authority, the Paul-Ehrlich-Institut (PEI).
   Optimizing the freezing process would therefore entail a new approval
   procedure. If the changed process was not previously known in the EU, a
   clinical study is also required. Discussion: For this reason, the
   conditions are not improved in case of doubt, although it is known that
   this could lead to a higher quality of the tissue after thawing. Less
   toxic CPA could simplify the approval procedure and thus contribute to
   improved tissue storage for transplantation. The same applies to the
   cryopreservation of tissue engineered products.
   Vascular access is a key issue for survival for uremic patients that
   need acute or chronic dialysis. In acute settings the use of central
   venous catheters, holding two luminae, are most commonly used in the
   intensive care for continuous or intermittent hemodialysis. Such
   catheters may be of acute type or a chronic type containing a separate
   cuff to limit bacterial invasion into the vessels. Another option is to
   place a peritoneal dialysis catheter into the abdominal cavity. If using
   the right technique, this catheter can be surgically inserted in local
   anesthesia and could be used directly postoperatively for acute but also
   chronic peritoneal dialysis. For chronic hemodialysis (HD) the
   preferable option is to place an arteriovenous fistula (AVF) at the
   lower arm. This results in enlargement of the vein, and partly fibrosis,
   that allows for frequent punctures leaving no material externalized
   after the end of a HD procedure. A problem is the development of
   vascular stenosis and thrombosis that need interventions in at least 50%
   of patients within one year. When the AVF fails an option is to insert a
   graft (AVG). This may be either a biologic or synthetic graft
   interpositioned between the feeding artery and a more proximal vein
   below the elbow instead of the local vein that usually is occluded. If
   this option even fails, the patient has to rely on a sufficient
   permanent central dialysis catheter where complication such as bacterial
   contamination and occlusions are problems. To avoid such catheters a
   dream for future would be a graft as AV access that is made of an
   autologous biodegradable material that has physiological characteristics
   that prevent stenosis and clotting and also is possible to easy correct
   in its diameter to adjust for the volume of blood returned/minute to the
   heart to avoid congestive heart failure.
   Objectives: It has been observed that the in-vivo dialyser clearance for
   small solutes is not constant during a hemodialysis (HD) session. This
   may influence the choice of the value to be measured and reported. We
   investigated the presence of trends in the clearances of urea and
   creatinine, and how it impacts their values. Methods: Diffusive
   clearances were calculated for urea and creatinine from dialysate
   concentration data measured in 25 patients who underwent 3 consecutive
   HD sessions each. Clearance values were obtained for each hour (at 0,
   60, 120, 180, 240 minutes). The significance of the observed trend in
   the data was statistically tested, as was any difference between the
   values at 2 and 3 hours, and the average clearance during the session.
   Results: Urea clearance showed an overall increase from the start of HD
   (by +10.1 +/- 19.3 mL/min, p = 0.0002) while creatinine clearance
   decreased (by -30.7 +/- 17.1 mL/min, p < 10(-4)). For urea, there was,
   however, a significant increase during the first hour (by +26.5 +/- 16.3
   mL/min, p < 10(-4)) which was not observed for creatinine. Starting from
   2 hours, both clearances decreased significantly, but the overall drop
   for creatinine was twice that for urea (by -34.1 +/- 15.7 vs. -16.3 +/-
   19.8 mL/min, p < 10(-4)). As a consequence of these different trends,
   clearance at 2 h, 3 h, and the time-average clearance were not
   significantly different for urea (199.2 +/- 25.9 mL/min, p = 0.18),
   whereas they were so for creatinine (2 h: 115.9 +/- 26.3 mL/min vs. 3 h:
   106.2 +/- 29.2 mL/min vs. average: 109.7 +/- 26.1 mL/min, p < 10(-4)).
   Discussion: A decrease in clearance during HD can be expected because of
   the progressive clogging of the dialyzer membrane's pores. It is not
   clear however the reason for the higher decrease in creatinine compared
   to urea. Our results suggest anyway that the time at which creatinine
   clearance is measured in-vivo should be clearly reported, as the
   difference during the session might be as high as 30%.
   Objectives: Currently, there are no reliable internal treatment options
   for large segmental bone defects. The objective of this study is to
   develop an alternative treatment for a young male patient with a huge
   180mm diaphyseal tibial bone defect, who was already recommended
   amputation. Methods: A modular add-on system is developed for a
   commercially available motorized bone lengthening nail (Ellipse
   Technolo-gies, USA). The system allows bifocal segmental transport of
   osteotomized bone segments. By this, the bone defect is filled from two
   sides. A wire rope hoist shall ensure that the bone can overcome the
   distance from both sides, which re-duces the time of healing and the
   amount of implanted parts. A 3D-printed model of the patient's bone
   segments helps to design the implant system itself and the handling
   which includes fixation, transport and explantation. Results: The
   results show in accordance to previous studies that the developed
   implant system effectively transports both osteot-omized transport bone
   segments. The wire rope hoist mechanism and the modular construction
   works as planned. The implant system can be explanted successfully.
   Discussion: In this study, we present an individualized modular add-on
   implant solution. The advantage of the modular setup is that many parts
   can be manufactured in universal sizes. This method of bone
   reconstruction could help many patients, who suffer from large critical
   size defects.
   Among the various possible embodiments of Advanced Therapies and in
   particular of Tissue Engineering the use of temporary scaffolds to
   regenerate tissue defects is one of the key issues. The scaffolds should
   be specifically designed to create environments that promote tissue
   development and not merely to support the maintenance of communities of
   cells. To achieve that goal, highly functional scaffolds may combine
   specific morphologies and surface chemistry with the local release of
   bioactive agents. Many biomaterials have been proposed to produce
   scaffolds aiming the regeneration of a wealth of human tissues. We have
   a particular interest in developing systems based in biodegradable
   polymers. Those demanding applications require a combination of
   mechanical properties, processability, cell-friendly surfaces and
   tunable biodegradability that need to be tailored for the specific
   application envisioned. Those biomaterials are usually processed by
   different routes into devices with wide range of morphologies such as
   biodegradable fibers and meshes, films or particles and adaptable to
   different biomedical applications. In our approach, we combine the
   temporary scaffolds populated with therapeutically relevant communities
   of cells to generate a hybrid implant. For that we have explored
   different sources of adult and also embryonic stem cells. We are
   exploring the use of adult MSCs, namely obtained from the bone marrow
   for the development autologous-based therapies. We also develop
   strategies based in extra-embryonic tissues, such as the perivascular
   region of the umbilical cord (Wharton's Jelly). We are currently
   involved in a European consortium aiming at developing films with
   antimicrobial properties to be used in hospitals to cover surfaces that
   are prone to facilitate the transmission of infections. Those films use
   surface topographies and natural-derived oils to ensure the needed
   antibacterial properties to the films. This talk will review our latest
   developments of functionalized biomaterials and scaffolds in combination
   with stem cells for advanced biomedical devices and therapies.
   Objectives: Corwave LVAD is being developed to employ gentle oscillation
   of a membrane to propel blood, based on the wave motion of swimming
   fish. The pump output can be readily tuned by adjusting membrane
   oscillation frequency and magnitude. The purpose of this project was to
   increase the hydraulic efficiency, implement a physiologic pulsatility
   control algorithm, and confirm performance in animal implants. Methods:
   The fluid path of the pump was simulated by Fluid-Structure-Interaction
   (FSI) computational fluid dynamic analysis in COMSOL. Membrane size,
   oscillation frequency, oscillation magnitude, and the blood flow path
   were modeled and refined to improve hydraulic performance and eliminate
   areas of flow stagnation. Pumps were then tested in blood analogs and
   blood in mock circulation loops and in vitro hemolysis testing.
   Non-hermetic prototype pumps were implanted in a total of 25 sheep for
   acute and chronic implants. Results: Design simulations and individual
   component testing resulted in a pump which can generate 6+ LPM of blood
   flow against physiologic pressures with maximum shear rates orders of
   magnitude lower than those of rotary blood pumps. Mock loop testing
   demonstrated the pumps have "flat" HQ (pressure vs. flow) curves. Three
   control methods were developed: fixed, asynchronous pulsatile, and
   synchronous pulsatile. Pulsatile modes generated dP/dt>400 mmHg/s using
   sensorless detection of native ventricle systole. Animal implants
   demonstrated low hemolysis and an absence of renal infarcts, but were
   limited to about a week in duration due to the non-hermetic sealing of
   the pumps. Discussion: Application of robust computational simulation
   and bench top testing have produced a unique new kind of VAD, offering
   the flow capacity and reliability of rotary pumps, but adding
   physiologically relevant pulsatility without excessive shear rates.
   Future efforts will implement full hermeticity to extend animal study
   durations and confirm von Willebrand Factor compatibility.
   Objectives: To investigate the colonization potential of Ovine
   Endothelial Progenitor Cells (OEPCs) on thermoplastic silicone-based
   polyurethane (TSPU) polymer under static condition. Methods:
   Functionalised TSPU (F-TSPU) was prepared by first subjecting the TSPU
   nonwovens to plasma treatment, followed by sterilization with 70%
   ethanol for seven minutes and then coupling with VEGF under sterile
   conditions. TSPU without any additional treatment or modification,
   identified as NF-TSPU, were used as control. OEPCs were seeded at the
   density of 5x10(4) cell/cm(2) onto square 4 cm(2) sized polymers under
   static conditions. Samples were taken at three time points: 1, 3 and 7
   days. Samples were examined through live/dead staining and scanning
   electron microscopy (SEM) to check the progression of cellular
   colonization on the polymer. MTS assay was used to quantify the
   metabolic activity of the cells on the polymer. Results: Cells seeded on
   the polymer surface were clearly visible on the SEM images. On day 3,
   the cells could be observed as patches on surface but did not cover all
   the surface. By day 7, the cells had almost filled the polymer surface.
   In case of F-TSPU, at Day 7, the underlying fiber pattern of the polymer
   could be observed on the cell sheet covering the polymer. Whereas this
   feature was not seen for NF-TSPU, indicating that the cells attached
   firmly to F-TSPU compared to NF-TSPU. Bright green fluorescence was
   observed on samples that underwent live/dead staining, indicating
   presence of live cells. Only a few red spots, representing dead cells,
   were seen. The metabolic activity on NF-TSPU was quantified to be higher
   than in the F-TSPU, though the difference was not statistically
   significant. Discussion: Static cell seeding experiments showed that
   OEPCs were able to attach and grow on the surface of both types of TSPU.
   These are promising results suggesting that TSPU holds potential for
   engineering of a new generation of heart valve prostheses, which will be
   assessed in pre-clinical animal models in the near future.
   Objectives: To investigate the impact of rotational speed modulation on
   VAD hemodynamics by comparing the effects induced by the artificial
   pulse in the HeartMate 3 (HM3, Abbott Laboratories, USA) to those
   induced by the Lavare cycle in the HeartWare HVAD (Medtronic Inc., USA).
   Methods: We compared the effect of speed modulation to a baseline case
   with constant speed and pressure head in both HM3 and HVAD using
   computational fluid dynamics (CFD). CFD simulations employed high
   spatial (10(7) elements) and temporal (2 degrees per time step)
   resolution and one-way coupling to a lumped parameter model (LPM) of the
   cardiovascular system for physiologic boundary conditions. Lagrangian
   particle tracking was implemented to probe viscous and total stresses
   along cell paths. Results were validated against experimental
   pressure-flow (HQ) curves. Results: LPM results showed that HM3 and HVAD
   follow drastically different HQ loops during speed modulation,
   reflecting differences in pump characteristics, modulation rate and
   magnitude and associated fluid inertial effects. In the HM3, pump flow
   varied between -1.2 and 8.8 L/min during the artificial pulse vs. 3.7 to
   7.1 L/min in the HVAD during the Lavare cycle. Induced aortic pressure
   pulses were comparable (11.3 vs 13.2 mmHg). CFD results revealed higher
   baseline shear stresses in the HVAD than in the HM3, coherent with
   previous studies. In both pumps, stresses were highest during flow
   acceleration. Sudden flow deceleration during the artificial pulse
   destabilized the flow and thereby also increased turbulence and total
   stresses on particles. Discussion: While speed modulation may contribute
   to pump wash out and pulsatility, it may also increase flow disturbances
   and shear. By relating shear stress to the rate and magnitude of the
   speed changes, this study sheds light on the impact of the imposed
   accelerations on the stress fields. This is of relevance for the
   establishment of both built-in and physiologically-controlled speed
   modulation sequences.
   Objectives: Thrombotic deposition is a major consideration in the
   development of implantable cardiovascular devices. Recently, it has been
   demonstrated that fluid mechanical shear micro-gradients play a critical
   role in thrombogenesis. The goal of the present work is to develop a
   predictive computational model of platelet activation and deposition
   that can be used to assess the thrombotic burden of cardiovascular
   devices. We have developed a comprehensive model of platelet-mediated
   thrombogenesis which includes platelet transport in the blood flow,
   platelet activation induced by both agonists generated at sites of
   vascular injury and shear micro-gradients, kinetics and mechanics of
   platelet adhesion, and changes in the local fluid dynamics due to the
   growth of a thrombus. Methods: A 2D computational model was developed
   using the multi-physics finite element solver COMSOL 5.3a. The model can
   be described by a coupled set of convection-diffusion-reaction
   equations, and it comprises 7 species: resting and activated platelets,
   agonists that induce thrombosis, and an anticoagulant agent. Platelet
   adhesion at the surface was modeled via flux boundary conditions. Using
   a moving mesh for the surface, thrombus growth and consequent
   alterations in blood flow were modeled. In the case of a stenosis, the
   notions of shear stress-induced platelet activation in the acceleration
   zone and platelet deposition in the expansion zone downstream of the
   stenosis were studied. Results: The model provides the spatial and
   temporal evolution of thrombosis in the flow field. The computed density
   of platelets adherent to the surface was validated against experimental
   data. The results confirm the importance of considering both mechanical
   and chemical activation of platelets. Discussion: The developed model
   represents a potentially useful tool for the optimization of the design
   of the cardiovascular device flow path.
   Objectives: The aim of the study was to analyze the effect of glucose
   concentration in the culture medium on metabolism and viability of the
   human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) co-cultured with the
   human umbilical artery smooth muscle cells (HUASMC) on polysulfone
   semipermeable flat membranes. Methods: Cells were isolated from
   umbilical veins and arteries obtained by Caesarean section. Membranes
   with a surface area of 2 cm2 were covered with fibronectin to promote
   cells' attachment and then were placed in specially designed inserts.
   Cultures were carried out in 12-well plates filled with culture medium
   containing glucose in normal (5 mM) or high (20 mM) concentration. The
   HUVEC and HUASMC were seeded on separate membranes or on both sides of
   the same membrane with density of 4,600 cells/cm2. Cultures have been
   conducted in standard conditions (37oC, 5% CO2) for 7 days. Activity of
   the reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cell viability were analyzed using
   the flow cytometry (with DCFDA test and Annexin V / 7AAD test,
   respectively). Microscopic visualization of cells was made after
   fixation in formalin using hematoxylin and eosin staining. Results: In
   the HUVEC co-cultured with HUASMC the ROS activity was lower by 17% in
   the normal than in high glucose concentration. In normal glucose
   concentration the ROS activity of the HUVEC co-cultured with HUASMC was
   lower by 8% than in HUVEC cultured separately, whereas in high glucose
   concentration it was higher by 19%. Viability of HUVEC cultured
   separately in normal glucose concentration was higher by 4% than in high
   glucose concentration. Microscopic visualization of cells did not reveal
   any morphological differences. Discussion: In terms of the ROS activity
   the obtained preliminary results indicate a beneficial effect of HUASMC
   on HUVEC co-cultured in normal glucose concentration. The opposite
   tendency was observed in high glucose concentration.
   Objectives: Continuous rhythm monitoring is useful for predicting,
   determining and treating a large class of diseases. An implantable heart
   monitor is useful for this purpose. it has small dimensions and records
   events over a timeframe measured in years. The objective of the study is
   to develop methods and algorithms for determining QRS-complexes and
   disorders in the work of the heart. Methods: Several sources were used
   to obtain the ECG: large collections of recorded physiologic signals
   PhysioBank and BioModule BioHarness 3. Records of database have
   annotations with tags of QRS-complexes and conclusions of doctors.
   BioModule BioHarness 3 record lead V4 or V5 dependent on position
   electrodes. Sampling frequency is 1000 Hz. The records were made on the
   basis of I.M.Sechenov University Clinical Hospital No.1, Russia. The
   monitor of physiological parameters and the device for daily monitoring
   of ECG was installed by the patient simultaneously. Recording was
   carried out for 24 hours simultaneously on both instruments. The device
   for daily monitoring of ECG is used to determine the sensitivity and
   specificity of the developed methods. MATLAB was used to implement
   algorithms. Results: Testing the algorithm with PhisioNet database
   resulted in a mean sensitivity of 99.21% and a mean specificity of
   99.49%. Testing the algorithm with Biomodule 3 resulted in a mean
   sensitivity of 99.02% and a mean specificity of 93.69%. 16 records were
   analyzed. The analyzer gave an incorrect result in 2 cases. Discussion:
   A careful study of records revealed that algorithm sets false tags in
   the absence of contact between the electrodes and the surface of the
   human body. The device for daily monitoring of ECG continues to operate
   normally at the same time. A careful study of the annotations PhysioNet
   showed that they contain errors. Some records have been shortened or
   excluded for this reason.
   Objectives: The aim of this paper is to improve the design of the
   current commercial cannula being used by clinicians in order to minimise
   the blood flow stasis and thus avoid thrombosis in ECMO drainage cannula
   Methods: A CFD simulation is used in order to determine the optimum
   desing for the drainage cannula. The improved cannula design was
   fabricated and validated in-vitro using particle image velocimetry.
   Results: 16 different cannula designs were simulated and results were
   analysed in terms of velocity and mass flow rate at side holes and
   different sections of the cannula. Different parameters including side
   holes diameter, number, spacing, distance to the cannula tip, and angle
   relative to flow direction were investigated. Simulation results were in
   agreement with PIV. Discussion: This study demonstrated that the
   improved drainage cannula can significantly reduce blood flow stasis,
   and potentially thrombosis, in patients receiving ECMO.
   Objectives: The aim of this work was to study the influence of the
   constructive and personal characteristics of the wireless energy
   transfer system on the temperature distribution in biological tissues.
   The basic parameters of the transcutaneous energy transfer system, such
   as transmitted power, efficiency and displacements, were taken into
   account. The patient's personal characteristics, such as the thickness
   of biological tissue layers, were also taken into account. To obtain
   data on the level of thermal damage, Henriques and Moritz study was
   used. Methods: The temperature data was obtained using the numerical
   solution of a bioheat equation by the finite element method. This
   article mathematically evaluates thermal injury based on Henriques and
   Moritz study, in which damage can be represented as the speed of a
   chemical process. Results: The temperature distributions in the tissues
   corresponding to the following types of displacements were obtained:
   axial, lateral, angular and also for the case where there are no
   displacements. Also the temperature distributions in tissues with
   different structures were obtained. Further, the temperature values at
   the maximum heating points were used to estimate thermal damage to the
   tissues. Discussion: It was established that when a wireless energy
   transfer system is operated without displacements, the severity of
   thermal injury does not exceed the threshold corresponding to a
   first-degree burn. It was also found that the patient's personal
   characteristics are influenced by the temperature distribution in the
   case when a change in the thickness of a layer of biological tissue
   occurs in the region of the nearest heat source.
   Objectives: The objective of this work is the development of a two-phase
   blood model fluid for the use in upscaled flow models. In large scaled
   models of different flow geometries, frequently used water-glycerol
   mixtures are not sufficient because in critical regions with small gaps,
   e.g. between the rotor and the wall in cardiac support systems, the
   two-phases of blood have a great influence on the flow. Therefore, it is
   necessary that the model fluid represents both phases of blood: the
   plasma and the cells. Methods: Transparent alginate beads were used as a
   model of red blood cells. A water-glycerol mixture was used as a model
   fluid for plasma. The alginate beads made up about 40 % of the volume to
   model the proper hematocrit. Furthermore, the beads have a slightly
   higher density than the surrounding medium and keep floating once in
   motion. This was achieved by embedding hollow glass particles in the
   spheres that have a density <1.0 kg/l, also enabling particle tracking
   and flow analysis using the Particle Image Velocimetry method. A camera
   tracks the flow path of the beads through the required geometry.
   Reynolds similarity was maintained. Results: Flow analysis has been
   performed in an upscaled model of blade and gap of a ventricular assist
   device. Compared to a water-glycerol mixture, the proposed blood model
   fluid enabled the visualization of the strong influence of the two
   phases on the flow. Because of their transparency, it was possible to
   visualize the flow field at several layers in the fluid by choosing the
   appropriate light sections. Discussion: The proposed blood model fluid
   showed promising results in an initial case. Moreover, the results of
   the experiment lead to a possible optimization of the geometry of future
   rotor blades in blood pumps in order to reduce hemolysis. Further
   channel geometries will be explored. In the long term, the model can be
   used for experiments on flow analysis and optimization in blood pumps or
   as a validation model for CFD-codes to calculate multiphase flows.
   Objectives: FTR, the death rate among patients with complications, is an
   emerging quality metric, that has received an increasing focus in the
   last years. Concerning the management and outcome in life-threatening
   complications due to ECMO-insertion there are only few reports
   available. We report the successful rescue therapy in two patients of
   our hospitals large ECMO-patient cohort with severe ARDS who experienced
   right ventricular (RV)-perforation after v-v-ECMO-cannula insertion by
   the Seldinger's wire. Methods: RV perforation was assumed by
   deteriorating hemodynamics and immediate echo-cardiography showing
   cardiac tamponade during ECMO-cannula insertion. In cases of two
   patients an immediate bedside sternotomy was performed and the diagnosis
   verified. The source of bleeding was controlled and the tamponade was
   cleared. Either patient was transferred to the OR after ROSC for a
   definitive hemostasis and subsequent optimally controlled cannula
   placement. Results: Both patients survived this life-threatening event
   without neurological complications or further bleeding as well as no
   infections of the wounds. In Patient 1 the ECMO-therapy was not
   instituted immediately but later. This patient was weaned from ECMO
   after one week, survived six months but finally died due to an
   underlying disease. In Patient 2 switching the v-v- to an a-v-ECMO in
   the acute setting lead to a sufficient circulation during CPR. This
   patient was completely weaned from ECMO after 2 weeks and was finally
   discharged to rehabilitation after two months. Discussion: Successful
   management of seriously complicated ECMO- insertion is possible. The
   provision of an immediate bedside operative therapy and every kind of
   circulatory support to achieve ROSC seem to be essential in this
   setting. By reason of this concept a No-FTR situation could be achieved,
   which depicts a positive marker for quality of care for ECMO patients.
   Objectives: Blood trauma is an unintended consequence of mechanical
   circulatory support. Evidence indicates that exposure to high shears may
   induce sublethal changes to blood cells and also overt cell destruction.
   To determine whether such changes in blood properties have a functional
   impact on microcirculatory function, we examined the effect of surgery
   requiring cardiopulmonary bypass on the rheological properties of blood
   and also direct assessments of cell flux in the microcirculation.
   Methods: Thirty individuals requiring elective coronary artery bypass
   graft (n = 15) or valve surgery (n = 15) volunteered to participate.
   Dependent variables were collected prior to use of cardiopulmonary
   bypass, after 60 min of being on pump, and in the post-surgical period.
   Blood analyses included measurements of blood and plasma viscosity, red
   cell deformability, red cell aggregability, mechanical sensitivity of
   red cells, and levels of haemolysis, among others. Microcirculatory
   function was assessed using incident dark field visualisation of the
   sublingual vessels. Results and Discussion: Initial findings of this
   project indicate that blood viscosity and red cell aggregability are
   significantly affected by 60 min of cardiopulmonary bypass; these
   measures do not restore following the early post-surgical period.
   Microcirculatory assessments reveal altered transit and velocities of
   red cells, potentially indicating a link between biophysical assessments
   of blood and microcirculatory function. Extended presentation of this
   ongoing study will be presented, and discussed in the context of the
   secondary complications that still plague circulatory support patients.
   Objectives: Granulocyte and monocyte apheresis (GMA), in which
   granulocytes and monocytes are removed from the patient's whole blood,
   is used in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The
   objective of the present study was to clarify the effects of the
   anticoagulation methods used on blood clot formation in the column
   during GMA. Methods: Extracorporeal circulation was established for 60
   minutes in male Sprague Dawley rats. A small column filled with 0.7 g of
   cellulose diacetate beads was used. We administered heparin at a total
   dose of 0.5 U/g by 2 different administration methods: the bolus
   administration method (single bolus administration prior to
   extracorporeal circulation) and the half bolus and half continuous
   administration method. During extracorporeal circulation the arterial
   pressure, column inlet pressure, venous pressure, and activated clotting
   time (ACT) were measured. The hemoglobin (Hb) concentration of the
   eluate of the residual clots was measured after the extracorporeal
   circulation. Results: Extracorporeal circulation was performed stably
   for 60 minutes without events like in-circuit coagulation, in both
   groups. The ACT reached its peak value within 30 minutes in the bolus
   administration group, to decline gradually thereafter; on the other
   hand, in the half bolus and half continuous administration group, the
   ACT remained nearly constant during the extracorporeal circulation. The
   Hb concentration in the eluate was significantly lower in the bolus
   administration group than in the half bolus and half continuous
   administration group. Discussion: The results indicated that even for
   the same total dose of heparin, clot formation in the column was
   influenced by the method of administration. We concluded that bolus
   administration of heparin, which led to early peaking of the ACT value
   was more effective to reduce residual blood clotting in the column as
   compared to half bolus and half continuous administration.
   Objectives: Suction at the inlet of a Left Ventricular Assist Device
   (LVAD) is common and known to cause adverse events. It occurs when
   tissue is drawn towards the cannula, thus leading to a reduced or even
   ceased flow. Moreover, the sudden occlusion can cause flow situations
   inside the device to be dramatically different from typical operation.
   The objectives were to quantify the effect of suction on the rotor
   bearing of an LVAD in an advanced development status and to mitigate
   unfavorable effects on the ongoing therapy and pump performance.
   Methods: A custom-made suction module was integrated into an
   established, active mock circulation loop upstream of an LVAD. This
   module comprises a membrane that can occlude the inflow cannula
   depending on the pressure in its fluid chamber relative to an adjustable
   air pressure chamber. The LVAD is equipped with rotor position sensors
   for online position tracking. Suction was initiated by reducing venous
   return and thus pump inlet pressure or by actively increasing air
   pressure in the respective chamber. The tests were performed with active
   and inactive suction speed control algorithms. Results: Spontaneous
   suction by reducing venous return was unlikely for the LVAD under test
   independently of the stationary air pressure applied. By actively
   provoking suction, increased radial force on the rotor was observed with
   uncharacteristic movement of the rotor. The radial gap remained
   satisfactory for all operational points and patient scenarios
   investigated. Suction was accurately detected by the controller and the
   speed reduced accordingly, thus leading to a relieve of the suction
   event. Discussion: Ventricular suction is a critical event in two ways
   as it negatively affects the LVAD therapy and secondly provokes
   uncharacteristic forces that might be critical for device performance.
   Future research is needed to ensure that experimental models of suction
   represent the variety of supported ventricles accurately.
   Objectives: Human amniotic membrane (AM) is employed in a broad field of
   applications as a wound dressing, corneal treatment, and scaffolding
   material. However, mechanical properties of native membranes vary
   depending on the zone of the placenta where the AM is obtained. For this
   reason, mimicking the AM through tissue engineering is a way to obtain a
   membrane with standardized properties. One technique to mimic the
   morphology of the extracellular matrix of AM is electrospinning. With
   electrospinning, a nanometric arranged similarly to the AM extracellular
   matrix made of different polymeric blends could be obtained. In
   addition, the correct storage is a key point in order to guarantee the
   availability of such tissue-engineered constructs for clinical
   applications. Methods: The AM extract is first prepared from native
   material and then freeze-dried. Afterwards, the AM-based scaffolds are
   obtained using blend electrospinning of polyethylene oxide and
   freeze-dried AM. Structural and compositional properties are assessed by
   scanning electron microscopy and confocal Raman spectroscopy. The
   mechanical properties are evaluated by static mechanical testing before
   and after cryopreservation. The scaffold is then seeded with multipotent
   stromal cells. The biocompatibility of the tissue-engineered AM is
   analyzed using cytotoxicity assay. Results: The tissue-engineered
   membrane presents a nanostructured morphology similar to the
   extracellular matrix of AM. The compositional results can detect the
   presence of collagen, fibronectin and hyaluronic acid in the final
   material. Preliminary results present changes in the mechanical
   properties related to the cryopreservation. The fabrication technique
   for the tissue-engineered AM seemed not to alter the biocompatibility
   with stem cells. Discussion: The AM is ideal for treatment of different
   tissues, and in combination with polymeric materials by electrospinning,
   it could be a suitable candidate for a tissue-engineered membrane with
   standardized properties.
   Objectives: A mixed flow blood pump with an outer casing diameter of 9
   mm is proposed as part of an intracorporeal membrane oxygenator. The
   usage of a blood pump deals with major challenges in the design of an
   intravenous device, specifically overcoming the pressure drop and
   enabling a controllable blood flow. This study presents the design,
   manufacturing, experimental and numerical investigation of the pump
   prototype. Methods: The pump prototype was manufactured using a Kudo3D
   Titan 1 (Kudo3D Inc. Dublin, USA) 3D printer, utilizing liquid photo
   polymeric resin coupled with a digital light processing (DLP) curing
   process. A static test loop consisting of the pump, ultrasonic flow
   sensor and pressure sensors was used to obtain the pump characteristics
   at different rotational speeds ranging from 23000 to 32000 rpm. A water
   glycerol mixture with a dynamic viscosity of 3.4 mPa.s was selected as
   working fluid. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were
   carried out using the open source CFD code OpenFOAM (R). Results: Over
   the investigated range from 30 to 500 mmHg, stable characteristic curves
   at different rotational speeds were measured. At 27700 rpm, a flow rate
   of 1.4 L/min against a pressure difference of 174 mmHg was observed. CFD
   simulations show a good agreement of the numerically predicted and
   measured pump characteristics, with an average deviation of about 8 %.
   Discussion: The applied manufacturing process was capable to produce
   thin structured, complex parts down to 300 mu m wall thickness, durable
   enough to be used in experimental investigations up to 32000 rpm.
   Experimental pump characteristics show adequate performance of the
   proposed mixed flow pump for the intended purpose. CFD simulations
   accurately match the experimental pressure difference.
   Objectives: Ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) is a technique to evaluate
   lungs before transplantation. As a tool for experimental research, this
   method allows organ modification and assessment. However, the costs are
   high. The aim of this study was to establish a low-cost EVLP model on
   the one hand and to investigate the feasibility of surgical graft
   downsizing during EVLP on the other hand. We compared a lobectomy, a
   stapled wedge and a sutured wedge resection during EVLP. Methods: Pigs
   of 60 kg weight were used for organ harvesting. After cardiac death
   lungs were retrieved, flushed with Perfadex and perfused with autologous
   blood for 4 hours of EVLP. The circuit was assembled from an ECMO system
   consisting of a Deltastream DP2 pump (Medos), an Affinity Fusion
   oxygenator (Medtronic) and a hardshell reservoir. After 90 minutes of
   perfusion a lobectomy was performed. At intervals of 30 minutes, a
   stapled wedge resection and a sutured wedge resection were performed.
   Air leak and the loss of blood were measured. The function of the lung
   was monitored including pulmonary artery pressure and blood gas
   analysis. Results: 20 porcine lungs were used to establish a stable
   model. Another 7 lungs underwent surgical interventions. The blood loss
   after lobectomy (3,14 +/- 4,14 ml/min) and after stapled wedge resection
   (5,29 +/- 8,1 ml/min) was lower than after sutured wedge resection (33
   +/- 17,36 ml/min). There was no major difference in air leak after the
   surgical interventions (lobectomy: 0,06 +/- 0,16 l/min vs. stapler: 0,03
   +/- 0,09 l/min vs. suture: 0,04 +/- 0,1 l/min). The oxygenation
   performance was satisfactory. The pulmonary artery pressure was in a
   physiological range. Bleeding into the parenchyma after suture was
   higher compared to the other interventions. Discussion: The low-cost
   custom-made EVLP model presented here is feasible and stable. Surgical
   interventions during EVLP are possible. Performing a lobectomy and a
   wedge resection is superior to a wedge resection with suture regarding
   to the blood loss.
   Objectives: Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) possess an
   exceptional differentiation potential, as they are able to differentiate
   towards cells from all three germ layers. Owing to this capability, they
   are an attractive cell source for regenerative medicine applications and
   in vitro disease models. To date, coated substrates with Matrigel (R)
   and Geltrex (TM) have been providing promising platforms for hiPSC
   culture and differentiation. Besides many advantages, both substrates
   provide some drawbacks such as batch-to-batch variation and xenogeneic
   origin, which pose problems in potential clinical applications. To
   tackle these issues, a matrigel-mimetic synthetic biomaterial able to
   maintain hiPSCs in culture is required. Cell behavior is controlled by a
   complex set of biophysical (e.g. stiffness) as well as biological (e.g.
   growth factors) parameters. In this study, we want to develop a fully
   synthetic hiPSC-supporting hydrogel that allows investigating the
   influence of biophysical and biological parameters on hiPSCs. Methods:
   The substrates were prepared via crosslinking starPEG and heparin
   molecules with different molar ratios. Substrates were biofunctionalized
   with two methods based on NHS ester binding to amine groups of laminins
   in different ratios. hiPSCs were seeded on substrates and the medium was
   changed every day. Cells were stained after 72 hours for pluripotency
   markers (OCT4-SSEA4). Results: Functionalized substrates with storage
   modulus of 4kPa maintained hiPSCs culture. On the other hand, no
   adherent cells were observed on the substrates with a storage modulus of
   1kPa and 10kPa. Discussion: StarPEG-heparin hydrogels functionalized
   with laminin mixtures clearly represented an appropriate
   matrigel-mimetic growth substrate for the hiPSC culture and maintenance
   of their pluripotency. 3D cultures have already been shown to be
   superior to 2D and it is an outlook of this work.
   Objectives: Radiological procedures utilizing intravascular iodinated
   contrast media are being widely applied for both diagnostic and
   therapeutic purposes and represent one of the main causes of
   contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN).In this hospital-based study we tried
   to assess predictors for the development of CIN in patients undergoing
   cardiac catheterization. Methods: A total of 5604 patients undergoing
   coronary angiogram/PCI from 2007-2017 were enrolled in the study.
   Multivariate predictors of CIN were identified by logistic regression
   using stepwise selection with entry and exit criteria of p < 0.1. A
   two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) was constructed around the point
   estimate of the odds (OR). A p value Results: CIN occurred in 6 (1 parts
   per thousand) patients. The mean age of patients suffering from CIN was
   higher than in the whole population (66.5 +/- 31.15 vs. 58.66 +/- 28.57,
   p=0.03). Characteristics of patients who developed CIN were: older age,
   diabetes, higher creatinine and lower EF. The incidence of CIN in
   patients with diabetes was higher and statistically significant (84% vs.
   16%, p=0.01). Emergency cases were at higher risk of developing CIN than
   elective patients (85% vs.15%, p=0.001), respectively. Diabetes, CKD and
   EF < 50% were independent predictors of CIN (RR 2.4, 95% CI: 1.88 -
   7.132, p=0.008; RR 3.1, 95% CI: 2.17 - 6.682, p=0.003; RR 1.6, 95% CI:
   2.88 - 7.132, p=0.01, respectively). Discussion: The development of
   contrast-induced nephropathy in patients who underwent angiography and
   PCI was mainly related to older age, diabetes, lower GFR and heart
   failure, but not contrast material exposure.
   Objectives: To examine the efficacy of the short-time total liquid
   ventilation (TLV) with oxygen micro/nano bubble dispersed saline for
   severe and lethal respiratory failure (experiment 1 and 2, respectively)
   induced by intratracheal administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS).
   Methods: In experiment 1, fifteen rats were divided into three groups:
   LPS+TLV group (treatment group) received 5-min TLV 20 min after LPS (5
   mg/kg) administration, LPS+MGV group received 5-min mechanical gas
   ventilation (MGV) after the LPS administration, and PBS+MGV group
   received 5-min MGV 20 min after administration of phosphate buffered
   saline (PBS) instead of LPS. Ventilation weaning was performed after
   respiratory management for three hours. At two days after each
   treatment, hemodynamics and blood gas parameters were measured and the
   rats were subsequently sacrificed. The excised lungs were used for
   histological analysis and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). In experiment 2,
   ten rats were divided into two groups: LPS+TLV group and LPS+MGV group.
   Ten mg/kg LPS was used for inducing lethal acute lung injury and the
   survival rate was used for the primary outcome. Results: In experiment
   1, significant differences were confirmed between LPS+TLV group and
   LPS+MGV group in the value of blood oxygen, weight loss ratio, and
   inflammatory cytokines levels in BAL-fluid (p < 0.05). On the other
   hand, there was a significant difference only in arterial oxygen
   pressure between LPS+TLV group and PBS+MGV group. Severe inflammation in
   LPS+MGV group was also confirmed in the histological analysis. In
   experiment 2, all rats in LPS+MGV group died within two days, whereas
   80% of the rats in LPS+TLV group survived for one week. Moreover, the
   conditions of the survival rats showed normal in the pulmonary function
   and the alveolar structure after one week. Discussion: It is indicated
   that 5-min TLV with oxygen micro/nano bubble dispersed saline after LPS
   administration prevented severe respiratory failure and improved the
   survival rate dramatically without any disorders.
   Objectives: Natural biological tissues have electrical conductivities
   and it is required that artificial tissues also possessed such a
   property. We investigated the specific conductivity (s) of the
   bionanomaterial in the composition of bovine serum albumin (BSA) and
   single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT). Methods: We investigated the
   specific conductivity (s) of the bionanomaterial in the composition of
   bovine serum albumin (BSA) and single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT).
   The aqueous dispersion contained 25 wt.% BSA, 0.45 wt.% SWCNT.
   Dispersion on silicon substrates was applied by screen printing. After
   drying, the formed layers had approximate sizes: area - 5'20 mm2,
   thickness - 5 15mm. For all samples the dependence of s on temperature t
   was recorded when they were in a thermostat. The s(t) curves were taken
   with a numerous cycle n = 1 5 with increasing and decreasing
   temperatures in the region of t 20 45 degrees C. Results: The following
   data was obtained. With increasing n, the values of s and the hysteresis
   on s(t) decreased: at n = 1 - s 0.11 S/m, temperature resistance
   coefficient a -0.004 K-1, hysteresis on s(t), i.e. R/R0 0.90, where R0
   is the initial resistance, R is the final resistance; at n = 5 - s 36
   S/m, a -0.002 K-1, R/R0 0.95. Spectral studies in the optical range did
   not reveal any changes in the sample before and after a cyclic thermal
   action, which underlines the stability of BSA. Thus, in the layers of
   the BSA/SWCNT the s increases and the hysteresis on s(t) decreases with
   n = 1 5. Apparently, this behavior is associated with an increase in the
   number of contacts between nanotubes in the albumin matrix. Discussion:
   The studied layers of the composite bionanomaterial (BSA/SWCNT) has an
   acceptable value of specific conductivity (1,10 S/m) and mechanical
   properties (hardness 300 MPa) and is promising for biomedical
   applications.
   Objectives: Determine the outcomes and survival of patients who receive
   a temporary total artificial heart (TAH) as bridge to transplant or as
   bridge to decision by evaluating data from the Interagency Registry for
   Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) database in the
   U.S. Methods: Review of the INTERMACS database between 2006 and April
   2017 revealed a total of 450 patients had been implanted. The data was
   reviewed to determine survival rates, adverse events, and competing
   outcomes. Risk factors for mortality were determined using hazard
   function analysis. Results: Data from 450 patients (87% men; mean age,
   50 years) were available in the INTERMACS database. The 2 most common
   diagnoses were dilated cardiomyopathy (50%) and ischemic cardiomyopathy
   (20%). Risk factors for right heart failure were present in 82% of
   patients. Most patients were INTERMACS Profile 1 (43%) or 2 (37%) at
   implantation. There were 266 patients who eventually underwent
   transplantation, and 162 died. Overall 3-, 6-, and 12-month actuarial
   survival rates were 73%, 62%, and 53%, respectively. Risk factors for
   death included older age (p = 0.001), need for pre-implantation dialysis
   (p = 0.006), higher creatinine (p = 0.008) and lower albumin (p < 0.001)
   levels, and implantation at a low-volume center (<= 10 TAHs; p < 0.001).
   Competing-outcomes analysis showed 71% of patients in high-volume
   centers were alive on the device or had undergone transplantation at 12
   months after TAH implantation vs 57% in low-volume centers (p = 0.003).
   Discussion: Patients receiving TAHs have rapidly declining cardiac
   function and require prompt intervention. Experienced centers have
   better outcomes, likely related to patient selection, timing of
   implantation, patient care, and device management. Organized transfer of
   knowledge to low-volume centers could improve outcomes
   Objectives: To analyze the hemodynamic effect of ventricular assist
   devices using a multi-scale mathematical model of the human
   extracellular fluid system. Methods: A Ventricular Assist Device (VAD)
   model has been incorporated into the Digital Avatar, a multi-scale,
   closed-loop mathematical model of the human fluid system is composed of
   a network of major arteries, major veins, and lumped parameter models
   for the heart, pulmonary circulation, arterioles, capillaries, venules,
   cerebrospinal fluid and brain interstitial fluid. The mathematical model
   relies on one-dimensional PDEs for blood vessels and on ODEs for lumped
   parameter models. Results: Based on the model, we have quantified the
   hemodynamics of the systemic circulation with and without the medical
   device in healthy and unhealthy scenarios. Results will be shown at the
   conference. Discussion: Traditionally, bench testing, animal studies and
   clinical trials are used as the main source of evidence for getting
   medical devices on the market in the US. The associated costs and time
   are enormous and represent a burden for MedTech companies. In addition,
   the FDA wants to minimize animal and human study testing. In recent
   years, Computational Modelling and Simulation (CM&S) has made huge steps
   forward. CM&S are a valuable regulatory tool for its significant
   cost-savings in evaluating medical devices, simulating performance under
   scenarios that may not be possible with human use and quantifying the
   safety and efficacy of medical devices. However, the existing CM&S tools
   are highly specialized for each field and do not provide a platform that
   integrates all human body mechanisms. Computational Life's vision is to
   replicate all body mechanisms into a single, integrated software called
   Digital Avatar platform. The Digital Avatar platform will enable MedTech
   companies to perform feasibility testing and quantify the safety and the
   efficacy of (ideally) any type of medical device. Here we will show an
   application with the VAD system.
   Objectives: Three-dimensional (3D) in vitro cultivation systems have
   gained increased attention, since using these systems allows the precise
   study of mammalian cell physiology, intercellular interaction, as well
   as cell-matrix interactions. Another important cell culture parameter,
   often neglected in traditional cultivation, is the concentration of
   dissolved oxygen. Generally, cell culture is performed under ambient
   oxygen saturation (21%), while the oxygen amount available in vivo in
   human tissue is much lower (1% to 15%). The stiffness of in vivo tissues
   and in vitro constructs also plays a crucial role in cell fate and
   physiology. Methods: Semi-synthetic hydrogels with tunable properties
   allow creating a wide range of in vitro material stiffness. The
   development of hydrogel-based 3D cell culture gradient systems enables
   to obtain complex, but precisely defined in vitro microenvironments,
   which in turn allow a systematic investigation of the influence of
   microenvironmental conditions. Oxygen gradients in 3D and 2D cell
   culture can be created with the help of incubation chambers. Results:
   Encapsulation of mesenchymal stem cells containing fluorescent hypoxia
   sensors reveals specific conditions where the hypoxic response is
   activated and determines the influence of hydrogel stiffness on the
   hypoxic response. In the presented study, exact correlations between in
   situ O2 concentrations in 3D cell cultures (hydrogels and microtissues)
   and hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) activation are disclosed for the
   first time. Discussion: Creating stable in vitro oxygen gradients in 3D
   hydrogel-based cultures with stiffness variety helps to better
   understand and predict cell behavior (survival, cytokine expression,
   spontaneous differentiation of stem cells or migration capacity) in
   physiological and pathological in vivo conditions, as well as to find
   optimal conditions to simulate the in vivo cell niche.
   Objectives: Most breast and prostate cancers metastasize to the bone. To
   establish macrometastases, the disseminated tumor cells (DTC) need to
   have stem cell-like properties such as self-renewal and differentiation
   into other tumor cells. They compete with hematopoietic stem and
   progenitor cells (HSPC) and mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSC) for
   their specific microenvironment or 'niches'. Apart from biochemical
   factors in niches, biophysical cues also influence such interactions.
   The aim of this project is to investigate the intercellular crosstalk
   that occurs among these cells and the signalling pathways in a 3D porous
   hydrogel that was previously established in our group. Methods: The
   hydrogel mimics in structure the trabecular region of the bone marrow.
   Cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions will be investigated using
   fluorescence imaging techniques. The pathways will be analyzed with the
   help of Western blots and specific inhibitors. Cytokine array and ELISA
   will be used for assessing auto- and paracrine communication via soluble
   factors. The biophysical parameters such as the 3D architecture and
   mechanical properties will also be tuned and their effect studied.
   Results: The coculture of the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 with
   bone marrow-derived MSCs and the leukemic cell line KG-1a reveal
   formation of spheroid-like structures in the gels. Experiments are being
   performed to study the cell-cell interactions within these structures.
   Parallel experiments are being carried out regarding the effect of the
   3D architecture, which will be introduced by varying the porosity of the
   gel. Discussion: The results of these studies will help us to develop in
   vitro models of different tumor cell niches that will allow us in
   gaining a fundamental insight into the early events of bone metastasis.
   Tuning these parameters in the 3D bone marrow analog, we can have an
   understanding about how the biophysical cues affect the cellular
   activities.
   Objectives: Bioartificial liver devices aim to replace the
   detoxification and metabolic functions of the liver in people with liver
   failure. Shear stress and local velocities created by flow inside porous
   scaffolds need to be optimised to improve cell viability and avoid
   inflammation, however there are no relevant studies on the topic to
   date. Here, fluid dynamics inside porous cryogels were characterised
   using a purpose-built micro-PIV system. The aims were to develop a
   micro-PIV setup to record the flow inside cryogel structure and to
   characterise the nature of flow inside the cryogel channels by video
   post-processing in order to determine inlet design. Methods: HEMA- based
   cryogels were synthesised by cryogelation technique and the
   microstructure was analysed by SEM, confocal microscope and mu CT. Open
   porosity, overall porosity and permeability were extrapolated from mu
   CT. A mu PIV set up was developed to visualise flow inside cryogels
   which was composed of a digital camera with a long-distance microscope
   objective, a pulsating LED light source, a pump and an optical chamber
   to host the cryogel. Glass beads of 10 mu m size were used as tracers to
   mimic red blood cells. Videos were analysed with PIVlab in Matlab which
   allowed the interpolation of local velocities. Results: Cryogels
   possessed an open porosity, with pore size up to 100 mu m, as well as an
   interconnected network of pores, making it suitable for a perfused
   system. Fluid dynamics were optimized using a mu PIV setup which allows
   for the visualisation of flow inside the cryogel channels. Discussion:
   Videos showed that internal flow did not reorganize itself through the
   channels and was found to be laminar with Re < 1 with low vorticity.
   This suggests that molecules and toxins of the blood in the centre of a
   channel would not interact with hepatocytes seeded on the cryogel pore
   walls. Hence, flow reorganization could be promoted through a layered
   bioreactor. A layered cryogel structure was introduced to improve flow
   characteristics and improve toxin/hepatocyte interaction.
   Objectives: Generation of a large-scale stem cell derived bioartificial
   cardiac tissue (BCT) as a potential therapeutic option to replace
   damaged myocardium after myocardial infarction. Methods: Large-scale BCT
   was generated from cardiomyocytes (CMs) derived from human induced
   pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) mixed with human fibroblasts and a
   hydrogel solution in a newly designed tissue chamber with a diameter of
   43 mm. The BCT development was microscopically recorded and evaluated.
   Maturation of CMs within the tissue was confirmed by immunofluorescence
   staining for cardiac markers (alpha-SA, cTnT) as well as cell junction
   proteins (Con. 43, N-Cad). The integration of the tissue chamber in the
   novel custom-made bioreactor allowed investigating the initial
   parameters for electromechanical stimulation (such as pressure, stress
   amplitude, frequency) necessary for proper tissue maturation in a more
   physiological manner. To investigate the calcium handling through the
   tissue a new transgenic hiPSC line containing a genetically encoded
   calcium indicator (GCaMP6f) has been developed. Results: Microscopically
   evaluation at different time points reveals a progressive reduction of
   nearly 27% of the initial volume after 15 days, ccorresponding with an
   increased intercellular connectivity. After 48h, the tissue exhibited
   spontaneous contractions and coordinated and rhythmic contraction within
   the whole tissue after 6 days. As preliminary analysis, the beating of
   the tissue was video-optically recorded showing an estimated beating
   rate of 102 beats per minute. Immunofluorescence staining performed at
   day 15 showed highly organised cross-striations of sarcomere proteins.
   Initial integration of the tissue chamber in the bioreactor and
   implementation of the new GCaMP6f reporter cell line is still on-going.
   Discussion: The initial results confirmed that is possible to generate a
   large-scale BCT. However, the properties of the tissue have to be
   further investigated.
   Objectives: The Fontan procedure is performed for univentricular
   correction of the heart in pediatric patients with tricuspid atresia. In
   the Fontan circulation, the veins connect directly to the pulmonary
   artery. However, as a result of the procedure the load on the single
   functional ventricle of the heart and veins increases. Eventually,
   patients need a heart transplantation. A possible solution to the
   circulation deficiencies of the Fontan patients could be the ventricular
   assist device (VAD). The VAD is implanted between veins and the
   pulmonary artery. The aim of this study is to develop a model of the
   Fontan circulation with VAD support. Methods: We use mathematical models
   to reduce the time and resources spent on in vivo research. Nonlinear
   mathematical models represent sections of the cardiovascular system
   (CVS) in the form of blocks. Pressure variations in the CVS sections are
   described by a system of differential equations. Results: Appling VAD to
   the Fontan patients exhibits the potential to increase the venous return
   of blood. According to the Frank-Starling law, the stroke volume
   increases with increasing venous return. VAD creates a necessary
   pressure differential between the venous and pulmonary sections of CVS.
   Discussion: The interaction model of the Fontan circulation with VAD
   support demonstrates the normalization of the pressure and volume
   distribution in the CVS. This indicates that the method studied in this
   work may be a way to optimize the health condition of patients after
   Fontan procedure.
   Objectives: Autologous pericardium is one of the most ideal materials
   for cardiovascular reconstruction including pulmonary arteries and
   valvular cusps especially in pediatric patients. To improve the surgical
   handling, chemical pretreatments such as dehydration by ethanol (ET) or
   crosslinking by glutaraldehyde (GA) have been commonly attempted. In
   this study, we compared the effects of such chemical treatments with
   short period (10 min) on the mechanical properties of the porcine
   pericardium. Methods: Porcine pericardium (n=3) was separated into 3
   groups, raw group with no treatments (RAW), that under dehydration with
   70% ET for10 min (ET) and crosslinking with 0.6% GA for 10 min (GA). We
   measured 5 parameters of mechanical properties: the burst pressure,
   suture retention strength, ultimate tensile strength (UTS), ultimate
   strain (%) and stimulus modulus. Results: Minimal burst pressure of RAW
   group, ET group and GA group were 12160 mmHg, 10640 mmHg, and 8360 mmHg,
   respectively, all of which were high enough for cardiovascular
   substitutes. There were no significant differences in suture retention
   strength (RAW: 3.242 +/- 0.261 N, ET: 3.298 +/- 0.214 N, GA: 2.985 +/-
   0.165 N, p=0.529), UTS (RAW: 18.238 +/- 1.987 MPa, ET: 19.104 +/- 2.234
   MPa, GA: 16.059 +/- 1.233 MPa, p=0.486) or Young's modulus (RAW: 4.964
   +/- 0.551 MPa, ET: 4.544 +/- 0.719 MPa, GA: 3.921 +/- 0.288 MPa,
   p=0.408). Only the ultimate strain of GA group was significantly higher
   between the 3 groups (RAW: 35.64 +/- 2.82 %, ET: 37.99 +/- 2.38 %, GA:
   46.39 +/- 3.96 %, p=0.046). Discussion: Short period of chemical
   treatment using ET and GA might make it possible to improve the surgical
   handling without deteriorating the mechanical properties of pericardium.
   Engineering modelling and simulation have been being used in different
   industries for better product and process development for already many
   decades. Together with the developments in medical imaging, this
   engineering approach can now be applied to understand how different
   human organs function and eventually develop devices to replace them or
   support their correct functioning. A digital environment for development
   of artificial organs and medical devices is possible with correct
   application of engineering modelling and simulation. These concepts
   enable researchers and engineers to perform design iterations rapidly
   and with ease. This is why the application of engineering modelling and
   simulation is considered as one of the very important bio-technological
   advancements in the recent years and is projected to be so in the close
   future. In this respect; cardiology is one of the areas where this
   potential is being converted to valuable outputs. Virtual modelling and
   analysis of a representative beating human heart, patient specific heart
   modelling or digital prototypes of heart devices are main research
   interests of an interdisciplinary community of cardiologists, surgeons,
   engineers, and physicians. In the scope of cardiovascular simulations;
   patient specific (or normalized among a group of patients) medical
   imaging based CFD simulations and coupled multiphysics FSI simulations
   are the main approaches for generating the simulation frameworks moving
   forward in the road to ultimate digital twins of the human heart. This
   presentation is intended to give insights about various processes that
   lead to higher fidelity digital representations in the scope of
   cardiovascular simulations, including below:
   - CFD model generation based on CT scans - Non-invasive digital
   angiography & FFR CT (Fractional Flow Reserve) - Post-TAVI coronary flow
   - Blood flow in SIMULIA LHHM (Living Heart Human Model) with mechanical
   valves - Transcatheter tissue engineered aortic valve FSI simulation -
   Evolut R stent deployment in LHHM - Mitral Valve and Mitral Clip FSI
   simulation The presentation intends to give a brief introduction on the
   simulation concepts/approaches which can be applied to cardiovascular
   problems. While it intends to encourage the community to take the
   advantage of these concepts in cardiovascular research, it highlights
   the importance of correct modelling and accurate numerical simulations.
   Objectives: The Berlin Heart EXCOR is the most commonly used ventricular
   assist device in children. Pump thrombosis is a major complication of
   the system and is most likely to occur in smaller pumps used for
   children under the age of 2. Pump exchange is seen as the therapeutic
   gold standard, but is associated with high mortality if in- or outflow
   cannulas are affected and therefor have to be changed surgically.
   Methods: Herein we report our experience in the use of tissue-type
   plasminogen activator (Alteplase, Actilyse (R)) for the therapy of an
   acute pump thrombosis subtotally occluding the inflow cannula of a 7
   month old girl supported by a Berlin Heart EXCOR LVAD. The infant was
   supported by LVAD therapy used for acute left ventricular failure due to
   fulminant myocarditis, and the system was implanted 20 days prior to
   when the thrombotic event was reported. A treatment protocol of 1.2mg/kg
   - initial bolus application of 0.12mg/kg/2mins - of Alteplase infusion
   given continuously for 120mins was used, and the assist device was
   connected to a Maquet Quadrox-I neonatal and pediatric oxygenator to
   obviate thrombembolic complications. Results: The infant supported by
   Berlin Heart EXCOR LVAD was haemodynamically stable prior to the
   thrombotic event, and anticoagulation was performed with a continuous
   heparin infusion. Within a couple of hours, she became tachycardic and
   developed signs of low cardiac output, and a subtotal occlusion of the
   inflow cannula of the Berlin Heart System was diagnosed. As surgery was
   felt to be highly problematic, we decided to infuse Alteplase and
   achieved short-term success with resolution of the pump thrombosis
   within 2 hours. There was no adverse event. Discussion: Tissue-type
   plasminogen activator thrombolysis might be an effective treatment for
   Berlin Heart EXCOR thrombosis in haemodynamically compromised children.
   Additionally, the use of a Maquet Quadrox-I oxygenator might minimize
   the risk of major complications (i.e. thromboembolism) that have been
   reported in the literature.
   Drug discovery and development to date has relied on animal models,
   which are useful, but fail to resemble human physiology. The discovery
   of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) has led to the emergence
   of a new paradigm of drug screening using human patient- and
   disease-specific organ/tissue-models. One promising approach to generate
   these models is by combining the hiPSC technology with microfluidic
   devices tailored to create microphysiological environments. Such
   organ-on-a-chip platforms (OoCs) or microphysiological systems combine
   human genetic background, in vivo-like tissue structure, physiological
   functionality, and "vasculature-like" perfusion. Using microfabrication
   techniques, we have developed a variety of OoCs that incorporate complex
   human 3D tissues, such as retinal, choroidal, cardiac, pancreatic, and
   adipose tissue. By generating microphysiological environments the
   platform is capable of keeping the tissues viable and functional over
   multiple weeks. The OoCs generally consist of three functional
   components: organ-specific tissue chambers mimicking in vivo structure
   and microenvironment of the respective tissues; "vasculature-like" media
   channels enabling a precise and computationally predictable delivery of
   soluble compounds (nutrients, drugs, hormones); "endothelial-like"
   barriers protecting the tissues from shear forces while allowing
   diffusive transport. The small scale and accessibility for in situ
   analysis makes our OoCs amenable for both massive parallelization and
   integration into a high-content-screening approach. To facilitate and
   enable the adoption of OoCs in industrial and non-specialized
   laboratories, we have developed technologies for automated 3D tissue
   generation and for the flexible plug&play connection of individual
   modules to multi-organ-chips. These technologies paired with the
   versatility of our OoCs pave the way for applications in drug
   development, personalized medicine, toxicity screening, and mechanistic
   research.
   Objectives: The HeartMate 3 (HM3; Abbott, USA) is a new compact LVAD
   which is associated with several new technical features (e.g. fully
   magnetically levitated pump, artificial pulse, large pump gaps, modular
   driveline, etc.). These benefits are supposed to lead to superior
   outcomes and reduced adverse events as compared to its predecessor
   HeartMate II (HMII; Abbott, USA) and other comparable assist devices.
   With this study, we investigated the effect of HM3 implantation on the
   occurrence of gastrointestinal (GI) bleedings compared to other LVADs.
   Methods: We retrospectively studied a patient cohort of 595 patients who
   were supported with left ventricular assist devices. 170 Patients were
   supported by HMII, 81 Patients were supported by HM3 and 344 Patients
   were supported by HVAD (HeartWare, Medtronic, USA). Data was determined
   through retrospective examination of medical records. Exclusion criteria
   were biventricular assist devices and other types of assist devices as
   well as LVAD exchange and re-operative procedures. Results: Out of 595
   patients 146 patients (24.4%) presented with gastrointestinal bleeding
   after LVAD implantation. In the multivariate analysis GI bleeding was
   significantly dependent on age but not on the BMI or gender of the
   patient. Statistically we were able to show that the occurrence of GI
   bleedings is significantly connected to general bleedings but not to
   cerebral hemorrhages. The subgroup analysis revealed that the occurrence
   of GI bleedings was higher in the HVAD (26%) and HMII (26%) groups
   compared to the HM3 patients (14%). However, statistical significance
   could not be achieved. Discussion: The novel HeartMate 3 shows a
   promising adverse event profile with a reduced rate of gastrointestinal
   bleedings compared to its competitors. However statistical significance
   could not be achieved in this study. Thus, larger multi-center cohort
   analyses are needed.
   Objectives: In medical practice, it is necessary to control the
   movements of various parts of the body: limbs, joints, chest, tumors,
   etc. For such purposes, the most suitable are the composite
   bionanomaterials in the composition of carbon nanotubes. We investigated
   the strain sensor (tensoresistor) based on the layers of the
   bionanomaterial contained biological material (bovine serum albumin, BSA
   - matrix) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT - filler). Methods:
   The aqueous dispersion of 25 wt.% BSA/0.3 wt.% MWCNT was applied by
   screen printing on flexible polyethylene terephthalate substrates. After
   drying layers by laser irradiation ( 970 nm) various parameters of
   layers were controlled, i.e. resistance R, bending angle q, number of
   cycles n, measurement time, etc. One measurement cycle corresponded to a
   change within the range q >>+/- 150 degrees. Results: The slopes of Sq =
   (1/R0)dR/dq of the R(q) curves were considered to be
   strain-sensitivities, where R0 is the resistance of the sensor with q=0.
   It was found that with increasing the number n, R and Sq increase and
   the hysteresis on R(q) decreases. For the tensoresistor obtained:
   specific resistances 0.1 divided by 1 Wxm, Sq1.0 divided by 1.5%/grad.
   These results are high. Discussion: The physical picture of the change
   in the R(q) is as follows. When q>0, compression occurs, the amount of
   contacts between the nanotubes increases and the resistance drops
   relative to the state q=0. When q<0, the nanotubes move away from each
   other, the amount of contacts between the nanotubes decreases and the
   resistance increases relative to the state q=0. The examined layers of
   the bionanomaterial BSA/MWCNT as a strain sensor is of a particular
   interest for medical practice. In particular, for monitoring: movements
   (arms, blinking) and detection of signs of pathology (respiratory
   diseases, angina, et. al.).
   The new European Medical Device Regulation (MDR) is applicable on 26th
   May 2020. Then the current Medical Device Directive(MDD) and its
   national transpositions like the current German Medical Device Act
   (Medizinproduktegesetz) will be replaced by the new rules. Further
   transitions periods for existing certificates will not help for devices
   of the lowest risk class and will not free parties from taking into
   consideration the new rules for handling of device problems or
   registration. The new certification of existing devices in time will be
   challenging, because the accreditation and notification of notified
   bodies in accordance with the new requirements, which are needed for
   certification of higher risk class medical devices, is ongoing very
   slowly. The new European database is still not gone live, but the device
   and economic operator registration is dependent on the functioning of
   that database. A strong focus of the new regulation is on clinical
   evaluation of medical devices, which will leave manufacturers and
   developers probably with open questions. For example, what extend of
   clinical data is sufficient for keeping an existing device on the
   market? The presentation will highlight several obvious or less obvious
   changes due to the new regulation. It will provide guidance where to
   find additional answers for specific questions. And it will give an
   outlook on upcoming additional legislation and guidance.
   Objectives: Exercise capacity in patients with a continuous-flow left
   ventricular assist device (LVAD) is 50% compared to healthy subjects.
   Some patients show a better performance than others. Aim of this work is
   to investigate the factors responsible of this inter-subject
   variability. Methods: A cardiorespiratory simulator (CRS) was developed
   and combined with a model of the HVAD running at 2700 rpm to reproduce
   an "average" LVAD patients hemodynamic at rest and at exercise. The CRS
   was validated using the average hemodynamic data of >200 LVAD patients
   from the literature. Starting from this "average" LVAD profile, a
   sensitivity analysis was conducted by simulating a left/right
   ventricular contractility (Elmax/Ermax) and heat rate (HR) 20% higher
   than value usually observed at exercise. Results: The simulated
   "average" LVAD profile at rest is in full support with a total cardiac
   output (CO) of 4.8 l/min and a wedge pressure (Pw) of 13 mmHg. At
   exercise Pw increases to 26 mmHg and CO increases to 6.8 l/min, of which
   5.3 l/min pumped by the LVAD (QLVAD) and 1.5 l/min by the ventricle
   (QLV). An increased Elmax at exercise assures lower Pw (22 mmHg) and
   higher CO (7.4 l/min) due to a better contribution of the ventricle
   (QVAD=4.7 l/min, QLV=2.7 l/min). An improved HR also helps to sustain a
   better CO (7.1 l/min) as a combined effect of both pumps (QVAD= 5.4
   l/min, QLV=1.7 l/min). A better Emaxr induces a smaller improvement in
   CO (7.0 l/min) due to the increased LVAD support (QVAD=5.5 l/min,
   QLV=1.5 l/min), however Pw reaches 31 mmHg. Discussion: A better left
   ventricular inotropic response is mostly effective in accommodating a
   higher CO at exercise. A better right ventricular function has mild
   effects on CO and can increase Pw if not sustained by a good ejection on
   the left side. These results should be taken into account for the design
   of a physiological LVAD speed controller, tailored on specific patient's
   needs.
   The electro-hydraulically actuated Carmat total artificial heart (C-TAH)
   is designed for biventricular replacement in patients suffering from
   end-stage heart failure, either as bridge to transplant or destination
   therapy. It generates pulsatile flow which is automatically adapted to
   the patient's physiological needs. The device contains bio-prosthetic
   blood contacting materials, allowing for low dose anti-coagulation. A
   multi-centre European study is currently underway to assess the safety
   and performance of the C-TAH, with 6-months survival as primary
   objective. Preliminary results will be presented from a cohort of 10
   patients included in the study.
   Objectives: The mechano-biological behavior of mesenchymal stem cells
   (MSCs) in 2D and 3D cultures is determined by formation of actin
   filaments which occur as branched stress fibers. For clinical-scale
   expansion of functional MSCs, the use of xeno-based serum products is
   prohibited, but human platelet lysate (HPL) can potentially replace
   fetal bovine serum. Here we investigate actin filament formation and
   mitochondrial morphology in the 2D and 3D MSC culture supplemented with
   HPL and analyzed immunomodulatory molecules GARP, Foxp3 and IDO
   following pro-inflammatory stimulation. Methods: Human platelet lysate
   composition was determined with a proteome profiler assay. Amnion
   derived MSCs were cultured in HPL supplemented media and MSC morphology
   was analyzed by flow cytometry, confocal microscopy and scanning
   electron microscopy. Mechano-biological properties of cultured MSCs were
   performed by atomic force microscopy. Results: The occurrence of actin
   filaments in 2D MSCs cultivated in HPL supplemented media was decreased
   as compared to conventional growth media, where the number of ventral
   stress fibers, anchored at each end by focal adhesions, was affected and
   influenced membrane elasticity. Dorsal stress fibers or transverse arcs
   were not affected. Mitochondrial network dynamics in HPL cultivated MSCs
   showed a perinuclear accumulation. 3D cultivation of MSCs was less
   sensitive to media supplementation. Functional activity of GARP was
   found non-stimulated MSCs while expression of Foxp3 and IDO relied on
   pro-inflammatory stimuli. Discussion: In conclusion we can say that
   mechano-biological capabilities of MSCs cultivated in 2D and 3D rely on
   stress fibers, mitochondrial distribution and certain bioactive
   molecules such as GARP, Foxp3 and IDO. HPL supplementation leads to
   downregulation of f-actin filament formation as well as conserved
   membrane elasticity.
   Objectives: Modern research in cryobiology requires a deeper
   understanding of the influence of different factors on the
   cryopreservation of cells, tissues, and organs. One of these factors is
   ice crystallization which has a tremendous impact on the surveillance
   and quality of live objects during freezing, long term storage, and
   thawing. Analysis of this process requires software which should be able
   to obtain quantitative parameters of crystals in a human-like manner
   with acceptable processing speed. The purpose of this work is to
   consider the possibility of using the multiscale image representation
   for the quantitative analysis of ice crystals. Methods: In our research,
   we used microscopic images of ice crystals during crystals formation and
   thawing. In previous studies for the segmentation of ice crystals on the
   image, we used different approaches such as active contour. At the same
   time, it should be noticed that the speed of active contour expansion is
   low and thus time-consuming to process large time sequence. Thus, we
   suggest the application of a Gaussian Pyramid. This multiscale
   representation allows analysis at a low scale and improves at a high
   scale. Results: We have analyzed multiple images using the proposed
   approach. The results in the first approximation show a 2-fold increase
   in speed when using our implementation of active contours. At the same
   time, the segmented areas of crystals correspond to the approach without
   the use of multi-scale image representation. Discussion: The results of
   this work show that multiscale image representation can be applied to
   improve the speed and applicability of modern software for automated
   image analysis. The next steps will include applicability evaluation of
   multiscale representation for different cases as well as the development
   of software realizing vector processor architecture.
   Objectives: One of the objectives of hemodialysis (HD) is preserving
   optimal acid-base homeostasis. Bicarbonate is an obligatory component of
   dialysis fluids in order to titrate the acidic products of protein
   metabolism that accumulate between treatments. Even though bicarbonate
   can easily transfer across HD membranes, its plasma concentration does
   not equilibrate with that in dialysis fluid by the end of the treatment,
   for reasons unclear. We used a mathematical model to test whether an
   intradialytic increase in total non-bicarbonate buffer concentration in
   plasma (tNBBp) could explain this lack of equilibrium. Methods: We
   modified the model of CO2 and bicarbonate whole body transport proposed
   in 1995 by Rees and Andreassen, adding bicarbonate transfer from
   dialysis fluid to plasma via a dialyzer connected to an arteriovenous
   fistula. The model described the transport of O2, CO2, and base excess
   between different compartments: arterial and venous circulations,
   interstitial fluid and lung capillaries. In each compartment, equations
   describing the biochemistry of blood were solved to estimate the
   components of bicarbonate and non-bicarbonate buffer systems. Results:
   The model qualitatively described the typical intradialytic pattern of
   bicarbonate concentration, pH, base excess, CO2 and O2 partial pressures
   observed in patients under routine thrice weekly HD. Model predictions
   were compared assuming a constant or increasing tNBBp during HD. When
   tNBBp was allowed to increase, the intradialytic increase in plasma
   bicarbonate concentration was blunted and the model predictions better
   fit published time-dependent intradialytic plasma bicarbonate
   concentrations. Discussion: It was suggested in literature that HD
   treatment may stimulate an increased concentration of non-bicarbonate
   buffers and release of hydrogen ions from these organic acids. Our
   preliminary modeling results are consistent with this hypothesis and
   show that the model is capable of predicting the effect of the HD
   treatment on the buffer systems of the body.
   Objectives: To develop an implant for the bone-tendon transition, it is
   our approach to optimize polycaprolactone (PCL) scaffolds by coating for
   a functionalization with drug release systems. The procedure during the
   functionalization should enable a release of growth factors in a
   spatially and temporally graded way. Methods: The PCL fiber mats were
   prepared by electrospinning. Polydopamine (pDA)-based coatings were used
   to modify the surface of the fibers. To get thin polymeric, hydrophilic
   and biocompatible coatings we applied the pure pDA system and a
   co-deposition with amines (ethylenediamine (ED), hexamethylenediamine
   (HMD) and polyethyleneimine (PEI)). To functionalize our system with
   growth factors we used chitosan-based nanoparticles which can be loaded
   with the therapeutic proteins BMP-2 and TGF-beta. By a defined dipping
   procedure we generate fiber mats with a graded functionalization.
   Results: The measurement of the contact angle and the surface zeta
   potential showed a change from a hydrophobic PCL surface to a highly
   hydrophilic and amphoteric character for the coated systems. The charged
   surface enables the further functionalization with loaded nanoparticles.
   The release of BMP2 and TGF-beta from the functionalized scaffolds was
   established. With a dipping procedure we are able to functionalize our
   scaffolds in a graded way. Confocal laser scanning microscopy with
   fluorescence-labeled NP showed that we could generate up to three
   differently functionalized regions. Discussion: The results show the
   methodology is suited to prepare implants, which can release growth
   factors in a spatially and temporally controlled way. These graded
   implants can be used for in-situ tissue engineering.
   Objectives: Solute movement from blood to dialysis solution is largely
   determined by transmembrane pressure (TMP). Accordingly, it was
   imperative to develop a TMP control system that allows for the
   maintanence of constant pressure. TMP in dialyzer is one of the tasks in
   wearable artificial kidney development. In most of the known devices,
   transmembrane pressure is regulated only by adjusting the flow-pressure
   characteristics of the pump or mechanical uncontrolled clamping line.
   Methods: A system was proposed which consists of a pinch valve, a DC
   motor and a control circuit. This device allows you to automatically
   adjust the pressure. At first, the device reads data from the
   differential sensor, which measures the TMP. After that, the position of
   the moving part of the pinch valve changes and the degree of clamping of
   the line changes, which in turn affects the value of TMP. The case of
   the device was made using a 3D printer. A test bench was created in
   order to determine the effectiveness of maintaining a constant TMP. It
   consists of five parts: two circuits with two peristaltic pumps, a
   dialyzer, a differential pressure sensor and a power source. The
   pressure from the primary circuit was varied by manually clamping the
   line and the degree of pressure differential compensation by the pinch
   valve was determined. Results: The experiment showed that the TMP
   changes are fully compensated by the pinch valve. Accuracy of the
   developed device depends largely on accuracy of pressure measurement
   sensor. There was no change in the flow rate of the fluid, and this is
   important, because the rate of dialysate regeneration depends on the
   flow rate of the fluid. Discussion: The experiment showed that this
   device can be used to control TMP. Accuracy of the system allows you to
   use it in the wearable artificial kidney.
   Objectives: This paper describes the testing methods used in the
   development of software for an implantable heart monitor. It is a
   complex medical system. To identify errors made while writing software,
   as well as to detect deviations in the operation of the device in a
   timely manner, it is necessary to constantly carry out testing of all
   elements of the system. Methods: Testing methods used in the development
   of an implantable heart monitor: - debugging using JTAG, - self-test
   system, - testing via COM port, - recording test information in the
   device's internal memory (data logging), - interprocessor testing.
   Consider some of them in more detail. Debugging and testing using JTAG:
   Due to the fact that the development was carried out in Code Composer
   environment, this allowed the use of a special script language GEL
   (General Extension Language). This is an expression language used by the
   CCS debugger. Launch GEL files are used to automate software
   development. GEL is an interpreted language, and its syntax is the same
   as C. Thereby it is possible to carry out tests, and change them, or add
   new ones in the process of the main software. Logging: One of the
   testing methods is to track changes in the state of the system over
   time. One way is to write data to the device's internal memory. But in
   such a way that you can track at what point in time the change occurred.
   For this you can use time stamps. If the data is recorded strictly with
   a certain frequency, you can do without time stamps. Results: The
   presented test methods differ in that some of them can be used only in
   the early stages of development and some even when the device is at the
   end user. Discussion: Cardiovascular diseases are very dangerous and
   difficult to diagnose. Early diagnosis and prediction of these diseases
   can lead to an improvement in the quality of life of patients.
   Objectives: To clarify the reasons, beneficial effects and duration of
   AVF patency after radiological interventions in AVF stenosis. Methods:
   In 174 patients, 522 radiological investigations and endovascular
   treatments such as percutaneous trans luminal angioplasty (PTA) were
   analyzed, retrospectively. All investigations were performed due to
   clinical suspicion of impaired AVF function. Results: Arterial stenosis
   was significantly more frequent among patients with diabetes mellitus (p
   < 0.001) and interstitial nephritis (p < 0.001). According to the venous
   stenosis, the diagnosis did not affect the frequency (p=0.22), neither
   the degree of the stenosis (p=0.39). The degree of stenosis prior to PTA
   correlated significantly with the degree of remaining stenosis after
   intervention (p<0.001). Of the 174 patients, 123 (71%) performed a total
   of 318 PTA investigations. Repeated PTA was performed significantly more
   often in patients with diabetic nephropathy. The median times to first
   PTA and to the subsequent PTAs were 9.5 months and 5 months,
   respectively. Discussion: Patients with diabetic nephropathy are at a
   greater risk of getting recurrent stenosis; this motivates a closer
   follow up for these patients. Clinically significant stenosis should be
   dilated as meticulously and as soon as possible. Occlusions of the AVF
   in most instances can be successfully thrombolyzed or dilated upon early
   diagnosis.
   Objectives: Designing new ventricular assist devices to coupe two major
   challenges in the field: less invasive intervention and reducing side
   effects was our objective. Methods: Computer-aided design and
   computational fluid dynamics were performed with Solidworks 2017 to
   design and test several new bearingless centrifugal ventricular assist
   devices. Fused deposition modeling was used to build the models and
   subcutaneous implantation was simulated and transcutaneous power
   transfer was tested. Results: Two bearingless, fully implantable
   ventricular assisted devices were developed. The first is a radial flux
   motor fully magnetically levitated ventricular assist device. The second
   is an axial flux hydro-magnetically suspended rotor ventricular assist
   device. Both devices contain an internal rechargeable battery, power
   transfer coil, electronic circuit and have a cylindrical shape with
   15-20 mm height and 100 mm diameter. The flow is 3 l/min at 135 mmHg is
   achieved and efficiency of power transfer of 80% with a 5 mm gap. The
   devices are implantable in a pectoral subcutaneous pocket with the
   inflow connected to left atrium and the outflow to subclavian artery in
   a fashion pioneered in this field by CircuLite Synergy. Discussion: Both
   devices came with innovations in motor and pump design that set the
   foundation to build the entire system in a single body low height
   cylindrical shape, optimal for subcutaneous implantation and by this
   with good transcutaneous power transfer efficiency.
   Objectives: For most in vitro cultivations of mammalian cells, culture
   medium is supplemented with serum, which contains important proteins and
   factors for the cell growth. Previous experiments showed already a
   positive effect of human platelet lysate (hPL) as a medium supplement
   for the two-dimensional (2D) cultivation of mesenchymal stem cells
   (MSC). Since 3D culture systems gain big interest for in vitro
   applications and regenerative medicine, the influence of hPL on 3D cell
   culture models must also be investigated. Semi synthetic protein not
   sign based hydrogels represent a very promising 3D cell culture
   platform, which is biocompatible and biodegradable. Methods: In our
   work, gelatine-methacryloyl (GelMA) hydrogels with a various degree of
   functionalization were dissolved in different hPL concentrations (0 %,
   2.5 %, 50 %, 100 % hPL). The Influence of hPL on proliferation and
   differentiation of in GelMa encapsulated MSCs were monitored and
   measured via viability assays, immunocytochemical stainings and
   microscopy. Furthermore, the influence of hPL addition on mechanical
   characteristics of GelMA hydrogels was examined by swelling studies and
   rheometric analysis. Results: The addition of hPL to GelMA hydrogels
   enhances the cell-spreading, the degree of differentiation as well as
   cell viability in concentration-depended manner. Besides, the results of
   the rheometric tests showed an increase of hydrogel stiffness by using
   higher concentrations of hPL. Discussion: Obtained results demonstrate
   that supplementation of hydrogels with hPL has a positive effect on cell
   growth and differentiation. Moreover, hPL can be a promising hydrogel
   stiffness enhancer for application in 3D bioprinting.
   Objectives: Generally, LVAD thrombosis is diagnosed only by reviewing
   online logfiles that show an increase of power consumption and flow of
   the device. In order to increase diagnostic power and improve treatment
   management, trans-thoracic echocardiography was carried out to assess
   any blood flow changes. Methods: Eight patients (M 7; F 1) experienced a
   total of 17 Heart Ware VAD thromboses. At echocardiogram, a 4-chamber
   view was obtained and the echo probe beam was aligned to blood flow of
   the inflow cannula. Continous-wave Doppler was applied for the
   assessment of: 1) the increase of flow maximal velocity (Vmax) above
   basal ranges over several cardiac cycles and 2) the irregular
   discontinous sound of the device. Online logfiles were reviewed for
   abnormal increase in power consumption and flow compared to basal data.
   All patients underwent thrombolysis with rTPA. Echocardiography results
   before and after treatment were compared. Results: Thrombolysis was
   successful in all patients; one patient died due to cerebral
   haemorrhage. Echocardiograms before thrombolysis showed an increased
   mean Vmax of 6.4 +/- 0.5 m/sec, whereas after treatment Vmax was 360 +/-
   0.2 m/sec (p < 0.001). In all cases irregular, abnormal and
   discontinuous sounds were heard in thrombosed inflow cannulae. After
   thrombolysis only washing jet sounds were heard. Before thrombolysis
   logfiles showed a mean increase of power consumption of 5.6 +/- 0.3
   watts, returning to basal values of 3.8 +/- 0.3 watts after thrombolysis
   (p<0.001). Before thrombolysis logfiles showed mean flow of 6.2 +/- 0.6
   L/min, after treatment mean flow was back to normal ranges 4.2 +/- 0.5
   L/sec (p<0.001). Discussion: Transthoracic echocardiography showed a
   significant increase of blood flows in the inflow cannula of thrombosed
   LVAD devices, confirming findings of log files review. A combined
   approach by logfiles review and echocardiography is recommended in
   patients with LVAD thrombosis.
   Objectives: Leukocyte activation is correlated to a reduced immune
   response in ventricular assist device (VAD) patients. Research has
   displayed leukocyte microparticle (MP; 200-1000nm diameter) increases
   following VAD shear stress. However, questions still arise regarding MP
   role, impact and biogenesis. MPs are plasma membrane derived, but there
   are smaller (50-100nm diameter), cytoplasmic vesicles (exosomes) which
   are often overlooked, or mistaken for MPs. As such, unless these
   vesicles are successfully separated, they should be categorised as
   extracellular vesicles (EVs). EVs are known to have roles in cellular
   communications and implications in diseases, and it is desirable to
   assess leukocyte sub-sets and any associated roles in VAD complications.
   Methods: Bovine blood was diluted to a haematocrit of 30 +/- 2%
   according to ASTM standards. Blood was pumped for 6 hours in vitro with
   the CentriMag (R) centrifugal pump (Thoratec (R) Corp., USA). Flow
   cytometry determined a leukocyte EV population, having eliminated
   cellular debris. Platelet-poor plasma was tested for vesicle size and
   quantity using Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA), and immunoblotting
   conducted for exosome markers. Results: Flow cytometry data displayed an
   increase in leukocyte death in the CentriMag, correlating to an increase
   in leukocyte derived EV production. Further analysis determined that
   these vesicles were mainly monocyte derived, suggesting a potential
   implication in inflammation. Preliminary NTA and immunoblotting
   displayed increased EVs following shear, namely exosomes. Discussion:
   The presence of exosome marker staining and NTA size analysis displays
   evidence in favour of vesicle increase not being MP specific. As EVs
   have known implications in inflammation, infection and disease, these
   results suggest that exosomes may be associated with adverse events in
   clinical settings. Thus, exosomes should be further examined to
   elucidate any role as biomarkers of VAD related complications.
   Objectives: To investigate the influence of bone turnover markers in
   end-stage renal disease patients for severe secondary
   hyperparathyroidism (SHPT). Methods: 221 ESRD patients with SHPT were
   split into two groups according to the iPTH level: Mild SHPT group
   (M-group) (iPTH130 -600 pg/ml, n=86) and severe SHPT group (S-group)
   (iPTH > 1500pg/ml, n=53). Serum BTM such as beta- CrossLaps (ss-CTX)
   procollagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide (P1NP), osteocalcin (OC) were
   detected. Results: Compared to the M-group, the patients in S-group had
   higher levels of the ss-CTX (5877.40 +/- 423.01 pg/ml, vs 3206.90 +/-
   1438.27), P=0.000, the P1NP (1145.50 +/- 171.36 ug /ml, vs 440.00 +/-
   308.12), P=0.000, the OC (258.52 +/- 48.61 ng/ml, vs 221.74 +/- 75.99
   ng/ml), P=0.000. ROC Curve analysis for the main risk factors of the
   parathyroid hyperplasia were ss-CTX, P1NP, sALP, iPTH. Discussion:
   Severe SHPT had higher levels of bone turnover markers, which may have
   aggravated CKD-MBD.
   Objectives: One of the main functions of renal replacement therapy is
   removal of excess products of metabolism from blood. Uremic toxins,
   waste products found in the blood of patients in need of renal
   replacement therapy (RRT), have very high blood concentrations and are
   harmful to the organism. Uremic toxins have been found over 100 and
   their classification is based on their molecular mass and linkage to
   proteins. EUTox, the European uremic toxin work group, has divided
   uremic toxins into 3 groups: water soluble toxins with small molecular
   mass (MM) < 500 Da (e.g. urea); middle size molecules, MM > 500 Da,
   (e.g. beta 2-microglobulin); protein-bound uremic toxins (e.g. indoxyl
   sulphate and rho-cresyl sulfate). Methods: TalTech and a spin-off
   company grown out of the university, OFT, have developed a new,
   real-time multicomponent (MCM)-sensor to monitor all uremic toxin groups
   in RRT. MCM-sensor contains miniature LED-technology to measure
   UV-absorbance and fluorescence. During online measurements, the sensor
   is connected to dialysis machine outlet with easy-to-handle connectors.
   Results: The results from a pilot clinical study at Nephrology
   Department of North Estonia Medical Centre and Nephrology Department of
   Linkoping University Hospital will be presented. The outputs of the
   sensor are on-line concentration patterns of small, middle and
   protein-bound uremic toxins in the waste dialysis and the clinical
   parameters of the uremic toxin removal (removal rate, total solute
   removal). A telemetry application enables to follow the dialytic removal
   even on remote distances. Discussion: A concept for smart real-time
   monitoring of intermittent RRT has been realized as a novel miniaturized
   optical sensor performing intradialytic on-line multicomponent uremic
   toxins monitoring in the spent dialysate.
   Objectives: Since Carbon Nanotubes (CNT) were shown to enhance neural
   outgrowth towards them, an approach with a CNT-Silicone rubber compound
   that immerses the CNTs and thus anchors them to the implant is
   investigated in an animal model Methods: To compare the CNT-silicone
   rubber to state-of-the-art neuronal implant materials, 6 variations of
   the same implant with varying exposed materials were fabricated. The
   thin-film implants consisted of a polyimide substrate and metal pathways
   encapsulated in silicone rubber. Depending on the batch, either metal or
   CNT-silicone rubber were exposed. Female mice were implanted on the
   brain and under the skin (flank area) for 60 or 180 days. After
   necropsy, the head was fixed in 4% neutral buffered formaldehyde. After
   24h, it was stored in 70% ethanol for another 24h and then decalcified.
   It was then trimmed, dehydrated in ascending alcohol series and xylene.
   After embedding in Technovit 8100, sections with nominal thickness of 2
   mu m were cut. The same procedure was performed on the implants and skin
   from the flank, except they were embedded in paraffin and cut into 3 mu
   m slices. Light microscopic examination of Hematoxylin and eosin stained
   slices was performed. Results: During histopathological examination,
   both findings associated with surgery and implant-related microscopic
   changes were observed in sections from the head and flank. The tissue
   around the implant showed similar reactions in all groups. Macrophages
   and inflammatory cells as well as slight fibrosis were found around the
   implant in all animals Discussion: Preparation of tissue sections
   including thin film implants was shown to be possible, yet the
   differences in material properties led to problems during cutting.
   However, usage of different embedding materials for the tissues worked.
   These first results suggest that the used CNT-Silicone rubber materials
   could be used in short term applications.
   Objectives: The properties of nanocomposite (NC) poly
   (N-isopropylacrylamide) (NIPAM) hydrogels as well as 3D printing
   techniques for hydrogels have gained a lot of significance in the tissue
   engineering community. This study aims at the development of a stable
   water based ink formulation for nanocomposite hydrogels usable by
   DLP/SLA 3D-printers in the range of 365 - 405 nm to use them e.g. for
   investigations in water flows. Methods: Diphenyl
   (2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl)phosphine oxide (as photo-initiator), Laponite
   XLG (as nanocomposite crosslinker), sodium dodecyl sulfate (as
   surfactant) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (as crystallization inhibitor) were
   dissolved in a N-butyl acetat and isopropanol solution at room
   temperature. This organic phase was then mixed with bi-distilled water
   and stirred for 20 minutes in a closed container to form a micro
   emulsion. The micro emulsion was flash freezed in liquid nitrogen and
   freeze dried in a Virtis Advantage Plus freeze drying unit for at least
   24 h at -50 degrees C and 0.4 mbar. The obtained powder could be
   dispersed in a NIPAM/water solution to form a stable, UV-curable ink. To
   show the applicability of hydrogels for investigating flows around
   bodies in principle, experiments in a water channel will be conducted.
   Results: The obtained ink is suitable for the most commonly used SLA and
   DLP printers in the range of 365 - 405 nm. Whereas the expected curing
   time is much higher than the curing time of commercially available
   standard polymeric printing inks due to the inhibiting effect of the
   Laponite XLG. The applicability experiments are in preparation.
   Discussion: NC-hydrogels obtain through this photo-polymerization method
   show similar mechanical properties to the standard NC-hydrogels obtained
   through radical polymerization with potassium peroxodisulfate.
   Objectives: Laser interference lithography (LIL) and the layer-by-layer
   (LbL) technique are combined here for the first time to design a system
   with variable nanotopographies and surface viscoelasticity to regulate
   cell behavior. Methods: LIL is used to generate hexagonally arranged
   nanostructures of gold with different periodicity. In contrast, LBL is
   used to assemble a multilayer system of poly-L-lysine (PLL) and
   hyaluronic acid (HA) on top of the nanostructures. Moreover, the
   viscoelastic properties of that system are controlled by chemical
   cross-linking. Results: We show that the topography designed with LIL is
   still present after multilayer deposition and that the formation of the
   multilayer system renders the surfaces hydrophilic, which is opposite to
   the hydrophobic nature of pristine nanostructures. The heterogenic
   system is applied to study the effect on adhesion and differentiation of
   human adipose-derived stem cells (hADSC). We show that hADSC spreading
   is increasing with cross-linking degree on flat multilayers, while it is
   decreasing on nanostructures modified with multilayers. In addition,
   early effects on signal transduction processes are seen. Finally, hADSC
   differentiation into chondrogenic and osteogenic lineages is superior to
   adipogenic lineages on nanostructures modified with multilayers.
   Discussion: Hence, the presented system offers great potential to guide
   stem cell differentiation on surfaces of implants and tissue engineering
   scaffolds.
   Objectives: The Gibbs-Donnan theory describes the equilibrium of ionic
   solutions separated by a semipermeable membrane, when only one solution
   contains charged macromolecules that cannot pass the membrane. The
   problem was originally formulated for simple solutions, such as
   dissociated NaCl, which allowed to calculate the ratio between ions
   concentrations at the sides of the membrane (Gibbs-Donnan factor).
   Solutions like plasma and interstitial fluid, and dialysate, contain
   however ions with different valence, and proteins in each compartment
   have a different concentration (and therefore charge); the classic
   theory needs an extension to describe these real-world scenarios. In
   this study we propose a new method to calculate Gibbs-Donnan factors for
   such more complex cases. Methods: From electroneutrality considerations
   and the definition of Nernst potential it is possible to derive a new
   expression of Gibbs-Donnan factor which depends on the total
   concentrations of ions of the same valence. This allows, for two
   solutions A and B, to calculate the concentration of all ions in
   solution B, given: 1) macromolecule concentrations in A and B, 2)
   solutes concentrations in A. The transitivity of Donnan factors was
   proved: for 3 solutions at equilibrium (A, B, C) the factor of A to C is
   equal to the ratio of the factors from A to B and B to C. Results: As a
   demonstration, the theory was applied to the calculation of the
   concentrations in interstitial fluid (Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Cl-, HCO3-,
   HPO42-, SO42-, C3H5O3-) starting from values reported in literature. The
   calculated interstitial concentrations were close to the reported ones,
   with a global RMSE equal to 6%. Discussion: The Donnan factors for small
   ions in biological fluids have relatively small deviation from unity,
   but their precise value may be of importance for ions whose
   concentrations are similar at both sides of the membrane, as for example
   sodium and calcium transport in hemodialyzers and peritoneal dialysis.
   Objectives: Biobanking of in vitro engineered tissues presents obvious
   advantages associated with flexible preparation and shipping scheduling.
   To provide sufficient cryoprotection, alternative research models,
   freezing approaches and cryoprotective agents (CPAs) have to be
   established in view of complexity and diversity of composite tissues.
   Here, we evaluated the effects of conventional freezing (CF) and
   directional freezing (DF) for cryopreservation of cell-seeded
   electrospun fiber mats. Methods: Fiber mats were produced from
   polycaprolactone and polylactic acid (PCL-PLA, ratio 200:100) using
   electrospinning. Structure of electrospun mats was characterized using
   SEM and FTIR, whereas their heat capacity was determined using DSC. The
   square-shape mats (1x1 cm, UV-sterilized) were seeded with HeLa cells
   (5x104/scaffold) and cultivated at static conditions. Samples were
   frozen using 1 K/min to -80 degrees C (CF) or with the directional ice
   growth at the speed of 30 mu m/sec over a 2.6 mm gradient gap (from -4
   to -10 degrees C) i.e. 4 K/min followed by further cooling to -20
   degrees C at 1 K/min (translational cryostage) and to -80 degrees C with
   1 K/min (LN flow cooling stage). The viability of cells was evaluated 24
   h after thawing using fluorescein diacetate and propidium iodide
   staining. Results: PCL-PLA mats exhibited no cytotoxicity on HeLa cells
   in vitro (viability higher than 90%). Only single cells survived both CF
   and DF when frozen in culture medium (negative control). In contrast,
   the majority of cells on fiber mats were alive after freezing under
   protection of DMSO. Discussion: We showed that although not yet
   optimized, DF was as effective as CF for cryopreservation of cell-seeded
   PCL-PLA fiber mats. Preliminary studies on using antifreeze protein Type
   III (AFPIII) (10 and 100 mu M) as a sole CPA indicates that
   extracellular protection might not be enough to prevent freezing injury.
   Our recent work on electroporation of cells within electrospun fiber
   mats yielded encouraging results and the further initiative will be to
   deliver AFPs into cells using electroporation to provide DMSO-free
   cryopreservation of tissue-engineered constructs.
   Objectives: Computational tools for accurate evaluation of healthcare
   products are increasingly being recognized by the European Parliament,
   US Congress and FDA and represent a highly valuable tool for speeding up
   and reducing investments associated with the demanding certification
   process of medical devices. InSilicoTrials Technologies is developing a
   collaborative, automatized cloud-based platform to assist medical device
   and pharma companies in performing modelling and simulation activities
   to accelerate medical innovation while responding to recommendations of
   European and US parliaments and regulatory bodies. Methods: Simulations
   provided by scientific partners are integrated within a secured and
   privacy-preserved environment, ultimately providing the users
   (companies, research and clinical centers) with in silico solutions for
   different steps of the R&D process on medical devices and drugs.
   Simulation results as well as an automatically created simulation report
   can be formatted in conformity with guidelines provided by EMA and FDA
   while taking in consideration the new European Medical Device
   Regulation. Results: Tools currently hosted on the platform are: NuMRIs,
   an automatic tool to assess magnetic resonance imaging radio-frequency
   safety of medical devices, implemented in collaboration with the US FDA
   Center for Devices and Radiological Health and ANSYS. QT/TdP Risk
   Screen, an automated tool to assess drug-induced pro-arrhythmic and
   Torsade de Pointes risk of small molecules, developed in collaboration
   with Universitat Politecnica de Valencia and Fundacio' Institut Mar
   d'Investigations Mediques. Discussion: The use of computational
   technologies to support med registration is limited in scope or absent
   while the agencies are promoting the use of M&S in R&D and registration.
   This causes a gap in know-how between reality of the industry and
   regulatory expectations. InSilicoTrials bridges these gaps and helps
   industries to conform to regulatory recommendations in a timely and
   cost-effective manner.
   Objectives: Dialyzer design enhancing internal filtration may be
   beneficial to remove middle molecules from the patient's blood for the
   treatment of renal pathologies. Mathematical models have been proposed
   to predict the rate of internal filtration, at varying dialyzer geometry
   and operating conditions. However, such models generally consist of
   difficult differential equations, that may not be easily used and
   implemented in clinical practice. In this work, an analytical model to
   predict internal filtration, at varying dialyzer geometry and operating
   conditions, is presented. Methods: To identify an analytical formula
   allowing for the prediction of internal filtration, the Poiseuille
   equation was used to describe axial momentum transport in the blood and
   dialysate compartment, assuming constant fluid viscosities, whereas
   radial momentum transport across the membrane was described with the
   Darcy equation, assuming linear ultrafiltration flux. The model was
   validated by comparing the pressure profiles in blood and dialysate
   compartments, and the rate of internal filtration predicted by the model
   with experimental data reported in literature for in-house Theranova 400
   dialyzer. Results: An analytical formula to predict the rate of internal
   filtration at varying dialyzer geometry and operating conditions was
   obtained. Very good agreement (i.e. percentage error lower than 2%) was
   found between model predictions and experimental data for blood flow
   rate increasing from 300 to 400 ml/min, at constant dialyzer flow rate
   and zero net ultrafiltration flow rate. Good agreement was also found
   between internal filtration predicted by the analytical model presented
   in this work, and that predicted by using other one-dimensional
   mathematical models reported in literature. Discussion: The analytical
   model presented in this work agrees well with experimental data, and can
   be used predict the rate of internal filtration at varying dialyzer
   geometry and operating conditions.
   Objectives: Despite the growing acceptance of LVAD therapy, concerns
   relating to adverse events have been raised. Fields such as implantation
   techniques, patient management and patient selection pose opportunities
   to advance outcomes, however, new and enhanced device technology, such
   as the ReinVAD LVAD, will have to contribute to improve and grow the
   therapy. Methods: The ReinVAD GmbH was founded as spin-off company of
   the Helmholtz-Institute of the RWTH Aachen University, Germany, and
   leads the development project to regulatory approval and clinical
   application. The core technology is a miniaturized, 3(rd) generation,
   centrifugal blood pump. It is the result of a multidisciplinary research
   and development program equipping the system with features that will
   improve outcome for bridge to transplantation and especially destination
   therapy patients. Results: Chronic trials typically up to 90 days in a
   sheep confirm the capabilities of the system with excellent resistance
   to thrombogenicity since no design related thrombus could be found
   despite ceased anti-coagulation after 6 weeks. Implemented features are
   a pump for partial and full support with flow up to 10 l/min, a fully
   integrated flow sensor, an implantable driveline connector, a highly
   pressure-sensitive pump characteristic, an automated speed controller
   and a user-friendly one-piece extracorporeal system. The sensor provides
   real flow measurements. The driveline connector ensures easy exchange in
   case of infections and renders the system ready-for-TET. The pump
   pressure sensitivity, among other effects, leads to increased exercise
   capacity and arterial pulsation. The controller ensures that the pump
   always operates at its optimal speed. The one-piece extracorporeal
   system reduces use errors and improves satisfaction with this component
   of everyday life. Discussion: The results indicate that the ReinVAD LVAD
   will be an effective system to enhance long-term circulatory support
   therapy.
   Objectives: Cardiovascular diseases shorten life span of hemodialysis
   (HD) patients. Recently pentraxin 3 (PTX) was considered as a biomarker
   of cardiac function, as well as an inflammatory biomarker. The aim of
   this study was to investigate if PTX was a useful biomarker to estimate
   patients' cardiac condition more than as inflammatory biomarker by
   analysing plasma in PTX, CRP, NT-pro-BNP (Pro-BNP) and troponin T before
   and after HD. Methods: Twenty patients on chronic HD were studied in a
   prospective cross-over study with three modes of HD with polysulfone
   dialyzers: (a) dry-stored (F8HPS, Fresenius) with a low blood level in
   the venous chamber (DL), (b) dry-stored with a blood level kept high
   (DH), and (c) a wet-stored dialyzer (Rexeed18L, Asahi Kasei Medical)
   with high level (WH). PTX, CRP, Pro-BNP and troponin T were assessed
   before and during 180 min of HD. Results: The mean value of PTX at
   baseline was correlated to Pro-BNP (rho=0.52, p<0.001) and troponin T
   (rho=0.363, p= 0.005), but there was no correlation to CRP. The mean
   value of PTX was significantly increased at 180 min (by 57%) compared to
   baseline data (p<0.001). The baseline values of PTX correlated with the
   extent of rise of PTX (rho=0.89, p<0.001), such as a higher baseline was
   related with more extensive increase. The mean difference value of PTX
   between baseline to 180 min of HD was correlated to that of
   Pro-BNP(rho=0.31, p=0.025), while there was no correlation to that of
   troponin T nor CRP. PTX rose less while on WH than on DL (mean 2.9 +/-
   1.4 vs 3.8 +/- 2.8, p=0.025). There was no difference in PTX at baseline
   among these three settings. Discussion: These data indicate that PTX is
   a more evident marker for the influence of the cardiac condition than an
   inflammatory marker during HD. Dialysis with WH causes least air
   contamination to the patient what may be a plausible reason for the
   difference.
   Objectives: Amniotic membrane (AM) is applied in variety of clinical
   settings, mainly in wound healing and as a biological dressing.
   Currently, AM is used in ophthalmology for the treatment of cornea
   pathologies. In this study, the regenerative potential of human amniotic
   membrane after cryopreservation was evaluated. Methods: AM was prepared
   under sterile conditions and frozen without cryoprotectants at -80
   degrees C. Native non-cryopreserved AM served as a control. The strategy
   for AM cryopreservation included one or two freezing and thawing cycles.
   Cytokine and growth factor profiles as well as morphology and mechanical
   properties of AM were compared before and after one and two cycles of
   cryopreservation. Levels of EGF, HGF, TGF-beta 1, bFGF, Laminin and
   Hyaluronic acid were measured by ELISA. Surface structure of the
   membrane was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Morphology
   was evaluated by histological analyses after Hematoxylin Eosin (HE)
   staining. Additionally, biomechanical characteristics, such as the
   modulus of elasticity (Young's modulus) and the tensile strength, were
   also investigated. Results: EGF, HGF, TGF-beta 1, bFGF, Laminin and
   Hyaluronic acid were detected in all studied samples. No significant
   differences were detected in the levels of those cytokines before and
   after cryopreservation. SEM analysis showed minor structural alterations
   of double cryopreserved samples. Analysis of HE stained AM showed minor
   changes between native and frozen membranes, such as few areas with
   desquamated epithelium which was caused by repeating freezing and
   thawing cycles. Mechanical tests did not reveal relevant changes between
   frozen and non-frozen samples. Discussion: Multiple cryopreservation
   steps are an essential part of manufacturing of human amniotic membranes
   to ensure a ready-to-use product availability. This study demonstrated
   that the cryopreservation does not impair the regenerative potential of
   AM required to support its therapeutic efficacy.
   Objectives: Cells are used in bioartificial organs (BAOs) to temporarily
   replace the complex metabolic functions that neither failing organs, nor
   their artificial substitutes may provide. This makes cell bioreactors a
   critical technology for BAOs development. Bioreactors are used for
   expanding stem (SCs), precursor (PCs), or line cells to clinical mass,
   for promoting SCs and PCs differentiation to the needed phenotype, and
   for providing patients with the organ regulatory and synthetic functions
   needed to foster organ healing or maintain patients state until
   transplantation (Tx). In some cases, they are also used to regenerate or
   preserve tissue until Tx. The structural and functional complexity of
   tissues and organs, the lack of information on their pathophysiology and
   on disease/damage evolution, the treatment time broadly varying with
   patients disease and state, all make bioreactor design and operation for
   BAOs very challenging. Methods: In spite of its complexity, cell
   bioreactors design for BAOs is generally based on the use of one cell
   type only (often line cells), scaffolds with suitable immune protective
   properties, and bioreactor configurations suitable for hosting clinical
   cell mass and intellectual property protection. Bioreactor performance
   has been enhanced with actuators to provide cells with mechanical,
   electrical and/or magnetic cues, often irrespective of tissue or organ
   specificity. Thus far, this approach has resulted in poor therapeutic
   success of the proposed BAOs. Results: Cell bioreactor design for BAOs
   may benefit of the approaches developed over the years to bioreactor
   design for engineering or regenerating 3D tissue or large solid organs
   in vitro. Discussion: Prospectively, future approaches to cell
   bioreactor design for BAOs should be patterned after those typical of
   tissue engineering and should aim to the optimization of the BAO
   treatment as a whole.
   Objectives: To find the most appropriate lock solution for central
   venous catheters to prevent catheter-related complications. Methods:
   Medline, Embase and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were
   systematically searched up to August 2018. We included randomized
   controlled trials comparing different lock solutions for adult dialysis
   patients (> 18 years old). The trials should report at least one primary
   or secondary outcome. Network meta-analyses of outcomes were performed
   using the netmeta 0.9-6 package in R (version 3.5.1). Other analyses
   were carried out by means of the network and network graphs packages in
   Stata version 15.0. Results: 50 trials (7142 patients) were included for
   this study. Compared with heparin 5000U/ml, antibiotic locks
   (antibiotics with TSC, EDTA, heparin 5000U/ml, low-dose heparin, or
   urokinase) and ethanol locks were more effective in preventing
   catheter-related bloodstream infections. Antimicrobial agents plus
   low-dose heparin (500-2500 U/ml), TSC and low-dose heparin locks had
   lower risk of bleeding events than heparin 5000 U/ml. No lock solution
   reduced rates of catheter malfunction and all-cause mortality compared
   with heparin 5000 U/ml. In summary, antibiotics plus low-dose heparin
   was ranked as the best lock solution. Considering the toxicity and drug
   resistance of antibiotics, ethanol could be the alternative
   antimicrobial lock solution. The overall results were not materially
   changed in sensitivity analyses. Discussion: In total, according to the
   two-dimensional graph, antimicrobial agents plus low-dose heparin
   (500-2500 U/ml) was the highest ranking lock solution, as it reduced the
   rates of CRBSI and the risk of bleeding significantly. Ethanol was the
   promising alternative antimicrobial lock solution of antibiotics to
   combine with anticoagulant agents. TSC alone did not prevent CRBSI, but
   it is safe.
   Objectives: The Fontan procedure is the current standard and the best
   palliative treatment for most patients with a functional univentricular
   heart. During the Fontan procedure the caval veins are anastomosed to
   the pulmonary arteries. The resulting total cavopulmonary connection
   (TCPC) allows for the support of an acceptable level of pulmonary
   circulation. At the same time there is the high risk of cardiovascular
   system failure due to the increased load on a single ventricle. In order
   to increase patient survival and quality of life, the different TCPC
   connections aimed at improving blood hemodynamic seems to be a logical
   treatment option. Methods: A CFD study was carried out for four types of
   TCPC (TCPC-1, TCPC-2, TCPC-3, TCPC-4) to determine the optimal
   connection from the point of view of hydraulic and power losses with and
   without the rotary blood pump (RBP) connected. The distribution of
   scalar shear stresses (SSS) in the volume was calculated, allowing for
   evaluation of the effect of the RBP on the blood at the operating point
   of 2.2 l/min and 11 mmHg of head pressure. Results: The results showed
   that the TCPC-3 connection has the optimal geometry, as there is a
   decrease in hydraulic losses corresponding to 5 mmHg, with power losses
   of 0.055 W. Hydraulic losses and power losses for other types of TCPC
   are equal to 6 mmHg and 0.07 W for TCPC-2, 9 mmHg and 0.08 W for TCPC-4,
   10 mmHg and 0.09 W for TCPC-1 respectively. The geometry optimization of
   the TCPC connection can significantly reduce the system losses, but only
   the integration of the RBP prevents these losses even for non-optimal
   TCPC. Discussion: Although the use of a pump has significantly reduced
   losses, the presence of increased SSS can have a negative effect on
   blood. The obtained values of SSS will allow in the future the
   estimation of the degree of blood damage and, as a consequence,
   hemolysis level.
   Objectives: The complex tree-like architecture of the lungs that ends
   with tiny alveolar sacs is difficult to mimic in-vitro. The delicate and
   ultra-thin alveolar barrier with its air-liquid interface is constantly
   exposed to the rhythmic respiratory movements. We report here about two
   organs-on-chip models that uniquely reproduce this environment and in
   which patients 'cells are cultured. A first model recapitulates an array
   of alveoli with in-vivo dimensions using a biological stretchable
   membrane. The second model mimics a functional lung capillary network.
   Methods: The key part of the lung alveolar model is a biological
   membrane made of collagen and elastin (CE) that is pipetted on a gold
   mesh, whose pores correspond to the alveolar size (about 200um). Once
   the dried CE-membrane is rehydrated, primary human cells (alveolar
   epithelial and endothelial) can be cultured on both sides. The second
   model is based on the self-assembly of endothelial cells and pericytes
   that are confined in fibrin gel in microengineered compartments.
   Results: A functional alveolar barrier made of primary human alveolar
   epithelial cells and lung endothelial cells is reported. The
   CE-membrane, on which the cells are cultured, is thin (a few
   micrometers), porous (enables the culture of cells at the air-liquid
   interface during several days), and stretchable. The reported lung
   microvasculature made of self-assembled endothelial cells and pericytes
   is perfusable, vasoactive (contracts in presence of phenylephrine, a
   vasoconstrictor) and is permeable. Discussion: These advanced in-vitro
   models enable mimicking the lung parenchymal environment in an
   unprecedented way. As a result, the cultured tissues made of primary
   human lung cells are able to maintain organ-specific functions, such as
   air-blood barrier tightness and microvascular perfusability and
   contractility. Organs-on-chip solutions, such as those presented here,
   may open new possibilities for specific tissue engineering applications.
   Objectives: Development of simple and effective technologies for cell
   storage at positive temperatures facilitates to extend their use and
   ensures safe transport between research and clinical centers. The aim is
   to study the viability and metabolic activity of human mesenchymal
   stromal cells (MSCs) encapsulated in alginate microspheres (AMS) during
   storage at positive temperatures. Methods: The experiments were
   performed on human dermal MSCs derived from adult donors after their
   informed consent. MSCs in suspension and in AMS were stored in sealed
   cryovials at 4, 22 and 37 degrees C. Cell viability and metabolic
   activity were evaluated by MTT- and AlamarBlue-tests and the ability to
   adhere to the culture plastic. Mitochondrial membrane potential was
   assessed with fluorescent dye JC-1. Differentiation potential was
   evaluated after cells induction to osteogenic and adipogenic lineages.
   Results: Encapsulation in AMS supported viability and metabolic activity
   of MSCs during storage in culture medium at ambient temperature at list
   for 3 days. Storage of MSCs under hypothermic conditions (4 degrees C)
   using special media contributed to a longer sustainability of cell
   viability. During storage alginate encapsulated cells retained the
   ability to multilineage differentiation, but had lower metabolic
   activity and mitochondrial membrane potential than cells in monolayer.
   On release from alginate microspheres, the cells were shown to attach,
   reverse metabolic activity and proliferate in a similar manner to that
   seen before encapsulation. Discussion: Encapsulation in alginate
   microspheres may be considered as a cheap and robust alternative to
   cryopreservation for the shirt-term storage and transport of cells for
   clinical and research projects.
   Objectives: In case of organ failure, several options can theoretically
   be considered, thanks to the progresses in medicine, materials science
   and biotechnology: i) transplant the same organ from a donor, ii)
   replace the functions of the failing organ by an artificial one, iii)
   repair its structure thanks to cell therapy or iv) engineer a new one in
   vitro before its implantation. Methods: As far as abdominal organs
   (kidney, liver, pancreas), the history of organ replacement follows
   different ways that will be considered. In addition to medical and
   scientific hurdles, economical or ethical issues can drive the choices
   for the "best" solution for the patient. Results: The case of pancreas
   is very specific since its transplantation is not the first option
   chosen to treat the failing organs, whereas it represents the gold
   standard for the liver and the kidney. In the case of liver, we still
   have to face the lack of purely artificial organ to treat acute liver
   failure or even chronic disease. Discussion: This is due to the
   complexity of the organs and the variety of its functions, some of them
   remaining relatively unknown. In this case, the option of engineering
   new liver in vitro combining hepatic cells of different phenotypes with
   an adequate matrix allowing high blood perfusion appears as the most
   promising option. Several approaches have been proposed, starting from
   the "basic" use of a semi-permeable hollow fiber membrane to host the
   cells to the bioprinting of the whole organ. We will discuss here the
   pros and cons of these different strategies.
   SensorStim Neurotechnology GmbH is a start-up of the TU Berlin. The
   business area is medical engineering based on neurostimulation and
   eHealth for rehabilitation and homecare. Our vision is to help people
   with limited mobility due to paralysis, spasticity or pain and to
   mobilize them with technical assistance. Our novel medical device
   enables the use of noninvasive neurostimulation for rehabilitation and
   therapy of people with disabilities after damage to the central nervous
   system - brain, spinal cord, pyramidal tract. It is mobile, easy to use
   and it can be used in water, too. Our device consists of a
   neurostimulator combined with body sensors and can be operated via a
   smart App. Furthermore, it can be used for clinical and home care. After
   a successful market entry, we further want to support walking, cycling
   and aqua gymnastics with electrical stimulation. We started in 2018 and
   are currently funded by grants of the Federal Ministry of Education and
   Research (BMBF), Investitionsbank Berlin (IBB) and private equity and
   development cooperations. By the end of 2019, we plan to achieve CE
   marking for our first product and ISO 13485 certification for our
   quality management system.
   Objectives: Intraventricular flow patterns during mechanical circulatory
   support (MCS) cannot be accessed by clinical imaging; therefore, either
   computational or in-vitro models are used. However, the complex anatomy
   of the heart cannot be replicated and simulations inherently rely on
   assumptions and simplifications. In an isolated porcine heart setup the
   feasibility of flow measurements by Echocardiographic Particle Image
   Velocimetry (E-PIV) was evaluated. Methods: Similar to cardiac
   transplantation, porcine hearts (n=8, animal weight: 80-106 kg) were
   excised and connected to the isolated heart setup. After resuscitation
   using blood as perfusate, a rotary blood pump was implanted,
   microbubbles were injected via the left atrium at different support
   situations and echocardiographic 3-chamber-view B-mode images were
   recorded with the highest possible frame rate of up to 141 Hz (Philips
   iE33, X5-1 xMatrix probe). By iterative PIV algorithms using correlation
   domain averaging and beam sweep correction, flow fields were evaluated
   for the different hemodynamic situations. Results: All hearts were
   successfully resuscitated in the isolated heart setup and different
   hemodynamic situations were adjusted. In the unsupported heart
   physiologic flow patterns with a large clockwise vortex structure that
   warrants washout of the whole cardiac chamber were found. With
   increasing MCS (2200-2700 rpm) the formation of this flow feature is
   diminished caused by the additional flow sink at the apex. In full
   support, without aortic valve opening in the left ventricular outflow
   tract, a stagnant structure was identified, that might be connected to
   thromboembolic events. Discussion: For the first time, the contribution
   of the mitral valve apparatus to blood flow patterns especially in the
   LVOT, which may be linked to energy loss, thrombus formation and valve
   deterioration during MCS was investigated under realistic conditions.
   Objectives: In order to determine the most effective ratio of liver
   cells (LC) and multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells of bone marrow (MSC
   BM) into implantable cell-engineering constructs (CECs) used for a
   correcting of chronic liver failure (CLF). Methods: In order to create
   liver CECs we employed a biopolymer implant - a composition of a
   heterogeneous collagen-containing gel, which concluded viable LC and MSC
   BM in ratios:1:1, 5:1 and 10:1 respectively. CECs with different ratios
   of LC and MSC BM were implanted into the livers of rats (n=40) in which
   CLF was modeled by using CCl4. The efficiency of the regulatory effects
   of CECs (with different cell ratios) on regenerative processes in livers
   were assessed by using biochemical, morphological and morphometric
   methods at different periods after their implantation. Results: During
   studying of the liver CECs with various ratios of LC and MSC BM (1:1,
   5:1, 10:1), it was found that the most optimal ratio of cells into the
   CECs was 5:1, because at such ratio of cells the most distinct
   normalization of morphological and functional liver parameters as well
   as maintenance of the structural homeostasis within the CECs took place
   within 365 days after modeling CLF. Discussion: The effective correction
   of CLF can be carried out by using the implanted liver CECs, in which
   donor liver cells and MSC BM are presented in ratios - 1:1, 5:1 and
   10:1. But analysis of prolonged correction of liver morphological and
   functional parameters at CECs using allows to recommend the preference
   using of CECs using with ratio 5:1, because prolonged preservation of
   structural homeostasis into themselves CECs makes possible to
   prognosticate their prolonged regulatory action on the liver tissue at
   CLF, especially for recipients on a waiting list for liver
   transplantation.
   Conventional hemolysis researches were performed under mainly constant
   shear stress, however, real flow in vivo would be under fluctuating
   shear stress. In addition, several conventional numerical simulations
   predicted abrupt shear stress fluctuation in the blood pumps in short
   time period. Furthermore, it was also reported that erythrocyte showed
   its unique viscoelastic shape change response to sinusoidal changing
   shear stress. Based on such information, we hypothesized that abrupt
   shear change would be additional hemolysis factor in addition to
   conventional shear stress and its exposure time. Therefore, the purpose
   of this study was to examine the feasibility of such our hypothesis. We
   developed special cylindrical shear chamber which can generate varying
   shear stress by controlling the rotational speed. This study used the
   shear device to generate several trapezoidal waveforms of shear
   stresses. In such shear fluctuation, the maximal shear stress of
   approximate 22.5 Pa were loaded to porcine whole blood for 5.0 seconds.
   And the time series integrated shear stress was set to equal between
   abrupt and slow shear change conditions. Then, generated hemolysis
   levels were compared between them. Each comparative studies were
   performed for twelve times. Furthermore, such studies were repeated
   under several different shear change speeds. The result of our all
   comparison showed greater hemolysis amount at abruptly fluctuating shear
   condition. Such results successfully validated our hypothesis.
   Objectives: Ex vivo platelet production in microfluidic bioreactors is a
   promising alternative to platelet donation for transfusion therapy.
   Platelets are formed by fragmentation of large bone marrow cells called
   megakaryocytes (MK). Hydrodynamic forces play a major role in the
   formation of platelets. In this work, we design microfluidic chips where
   isolated MK are exposed to hydrodynamic forces and we characterize their
   elongation and fragmentation. Methods: Polydimethylsiloxane chips are
   fabricated using standard soft lithography protocols and sealed to a
   glass slide. The 50 mu m deep rectangular chambers contain rows of 30 mu
   m-wide adhesive pillars. Human CD34+ cells isolated from umbilical cord
   blood are differentiated in vitro for 12 days to yield mature MK and
   infused with a concentration of 2x10(5) /mL into the chips at a wall
   shear rate of 1800s(-1). Their elongation and fragmentation is monitored
   by videomicroscopy. Images were analysed using ImageJ. Results: We
   perform a spatio-temporal analysis of MK elongation and show that
   platelet release is always preceded by a remodeling of the cell that
   spans over about 20 minutes, followed by a local, sudden increase in
   elongation velocity (5-fold increase in the 10 seconds prior to
   fragmentation). The amplitude of these variations is much larger than
   the spatial and temporal variations in the surrounding flow field.
   Discussion: Earlier studies have shown that dynamic conditions for in
   vitro platelet production not only accelerates the process but also
   enhances the quality of released platelets. Here, we show that MK
   elongation and fragmentation, though accelerated by the flow, are not
   solely governed by fluid-structure interactions. It seems that other
   mechanisms are involved in the regulation of platelet release,
   preventing it to occur before the platelet is fully functional.
   Objectives: The Eulerian version of the strain-based hemolysis model has
   already shown to predict different critical regions in blood pumps
   compared to the commonly used stress-based models. Where the
   stress-based model assumes an instantaneous deformation of red blood
   cells (RBCs) due to the action of fluid forces, the strain-based model
   is able to estimate the viscoelastic deformation of RBCs. Thus, the
   effect of exposure time is considered in a natural way. However, both
   models are based on the empirical power law assumption for hemoglobin
   transport and turned out to overpredict hemolysis compared to
   experimental data. In order to improve the prediction of free-plasma
   hemoglobin, the strain-based model is combined with a multiscale model
   for hemoglobin transport. The model is able to account for pore
   formation in the RBC membrane and the resulting hemoglobin mass transfer
   into the blood plasma. Thus, the model does not rely on the power law
   assumption. Methods: The formation of pores is computed based on an
   energy balance of the stretched RBC membrane, where an area strain can
   be computed by the tensor equation of the strain-based model. The
   hemoglobin release is modeled by a transport equation with a mass
   transfer coefficient as a function of shear, which can be fitted to the
   data of blood shearing experiments. As an application, the model is used
   for a benchmark blood pump provided by the FDA. Results: The estimated
   total hemolytic performance for the benchmark blood pump is
   significantly reduced compared to the power law version of the
   strain-based model. The new results are in good agreement with the
   measured data by the FDA. Discussion: The multiscale model for
   hemoglobin transport turns out to be a useful extension of the
   strain-based hemolysis model, allowing for an overall more physical
   model description of the hemolysis process. Application to different
   devices and blood shearing experiments should be investigated in the
   future, in order to study the parameter sensitivity.
   Objectives: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are membrane enclosed
   structures, which are released from all types of cells upon activation.
   Two examples for the role of EVs in extracorporeal therapies will be
   discussed in detail, (i) EVs as markers for cellular activation and (ii)
   EVs as platform for the binding of plasma proteins. We assessed the
   impact of regional citrate anticoagulation (2.8 vs. 5.6 mM) on the
   cellular activation in lipoprotein apheresis, using EVs as marker for
   cellular activation upon blood-adsorbent interaction. Moreover, we
   studied the ability of a commercial adsorbent (PentraSorb) for
   C-reactive protein (CRP) to remove both, soluble and EV-associated CRP
   from septic plasma. Methods: EVs were characterized in human blood or
   plasma via flow cytometry after calibration with fluorescent silica
   beads (1 mu m, 0.5 mu m, 0.3 mu m; Kisker Biotech).
   Phosphatidylserine-exposing EVs were identified as lactadherin-positive
   events in the EV gate. Antibodies against cell specific surface markers
   (CD41 for platelets, CD235a for red blood cells) were used to identify
   the cellular origin of EVs. An anti-CRP antibody was used to identify
   CRP carrying EVs. Results: During lipoprotein apheresis, platelet
   adhesion to the adsorbent polymer and EV release were associated with
   elevated markers for platelet activation and EV release was dependent on
   the citrate concentration in the extracorporeal circuit. Septic plasma
   contained significantly elevated levels of EVs, CRP+ EVs, as well as
   soluble CRP as compared to healthy donors. Incubation of plasma with the
   CRP adsorbent resulted in almost complete depletion of soluble CRP, and
   remaining EVs did not show any association with CRP, indicating
   detachment of CRP from the EVs. Discussion: In the context of apheresis,
   EVs can be considered as markers for cellular activation. Moreover, our
   data show that EVs can serve as a platform for the binding of CRP, which
   has been suggested to induce conformational changes of CRP and a shift
   towards pro-inflammatory characteristics.
   Objectives: In developing endovascular treatment devices, understanding
   their physical properties is one of the most important points. We have
   been developed film-type sensor for force measurement, applied to the
   field of biomechanics. In this study, the blood vessel model embedded
   pressure film sensor was fabricated and the contact pressure
   distribution in the circumferential direction was measured at balloon
   dilatation. Methods: The film sensor was constructed by a couple of
   patterned electrodes and pressure-sensitive layer. The film sensor was
   rolled and embedded to straight-shape silicone vessel model. The balloon
   catheter was expanded in a mock vessel. Results: The measured pressure
   at the mock vessel increased according to balloon dilatation pressure.
   At expanding of general balloon, the measured pressure at each point was
   almost the same. When expanding a scoring balloon, a balloon with wedge
   elements, the measured pressure at wedge contact points was higher than
   that of the other parts. Discussion: It is considerable that stress
   concentration state changes depending on the wedge shape and/or
   stiffness. The mock vessel is useful to understand dilatation property
   of scoring balloon.
   Objectives: Extra Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) is used to treat
   acute respiratory and circulatory failure. Recent advancements have led
   to impressive improvements in treatment results. Now clinicians urge for
   an ever-earlier ECMO application and a broadening of the indications:
   Mobility demand -> Every ECMO patient needs to be transported under
   severely restricted space conditions. Cost demand -> With rising ECMO
   numbers the cost ratio plays an increasing role for healthcare
   economics. Methods: A novel system uses a recombination of existing
   technologies to create a straightforward solution with a size and
   complexity reduction. The key principle is the sourcing of pump energy
   from the oxygen pressure, which is required to ventilate the oxygenator
   anyway. This modification allows a purely pneumatic operation and the
   usage of pulsatile pumps. Results: A pneumatically powered dual chamber
   pulsatile pump has been developed which avoids suction and high shear
   rates with improved wash out behaviour for the entire ECC system. The
   innovative pump is driven completely pneumatically without a complex and
   expensive driving console. Furthermore, a novel oxygenator has been
   developed. Initial prototypes of pumps and oxygenators have been
   optimized during multiple design iterations and tested in terms
   hydraulic characteristics and gas exchange properties on the bench using
   water glycerol and porcine blood. The entire system has a reduced
   surface area and priming volume and shows low internal pressure loss,
   excellent wash out and gas exchange parameters. The bench test results
   have been confirmed within a chronic GLP in vivo study in large animals.
   The new device's size and complexity have been significantly reduced
   compared to the state of the art systems. Discussion: The novel approach
   brings many advantages for the next generation ECMO/ECLS systems
   particularly in terms of function, mobility and cost-effectiveness.
   Objectives: The American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM)
   standards recommend bovine blood for in vitro testing of medical
   devices. Haemodilution is used to standardise haematocrit (HCT) to 30
   +/- 2% with phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Research has shown that PBS
   increases red blood cell mechanical fragility and significantly
   increases haemolysis. Thus, the objective of this study was to
   investigate the impact of diluent and dilution for in vitro testing,
   which may result in future considerations for ASTM standards. Methods:
   Bovine blood was diluted with either PBS or PBS+4g% BSA (bovine serum
   albumin) to a HCT of 30 +/- 2%. The blood was either pumped with the
   CentriMag (R) (Thoratec,USA) device under haemodynamic conditions or
   exposed to VAD-like shear for 6 hours. Blood was diluted to a range of
   70-94% (n=40). Plasma free haemoglobin levels were measured to calculate
   the normalised index of haemolysis (NIH). Protein concentrations were
   measured. Results: Haemodilution altered mechanical fragility depending
   on diluent and concentration. At a 70% blood dilution, PBS alone caused
   significantly higher haemolysis than PBS+4g% BSA. However, at a 90%
   blood dilution, PBS+4g% BSA caused significantly higher haemolysis than
   PBS alone. As such, a positive correlation was observed between dilution
   with PBS alone and NIH, whereas a negative correlation was observed
   between dilution with PBS+4g% BSA and NIH. Total protein concentration
   was significantly reduced at a 70% blood dilution with PBS alone but not
   at 90%. Discussion: To reach a HCT of 30%+/- 2%, this study recommends
   that bovine blood with a HCT of > 37% should be diluted with PBS + 4g%
   BSA (>80% blood dilution), whereas blood with a HCT of <37% should be
   diluted with PBS alone (<80% blood dilution). Haemodilution with BSA
   maintains physiological protein concentrations and may reduce bias
   during haemolysis testing with high dilutions. Thus, ASTM standards
   could consider including BSA as a diluent, when needed.
   Objectives: Obtaining normal serum potassium level is an important goal
   in maintenance hemodialysis patients. Hyperkalemia is known to be
   associated with mortality. In this study we aimed to access the
   relationship between pre-dialysis potassium level, nutritional status
   and survival in dialysis patients. Methods: This study used annual
   cohort of hemodialysis patients with 36 months of follow up. To
   determine the impact of potassium level on mortality, patients were
   followed from first potassium measurement until death or a censoring
   event; hypokalemia was defined by potassium levels below 5.5 mmol/l and
   albumin levels below 35g/l was considered an index for undernourished.
   Time-dependent Cox proportional hazard modeling was used to estimate the
   association between potassium level and mortality. Results: 199 patients
   were included in the study. Mean age was approximately 56 years, about
   59% were men and 23% had end-stage renal disease caused by diabetes.
   Albumin below 35g/l was observed in 26 (13%) of the patients. In the
   follow up period 40 (20%) patients died, comprising 24 (32%) of the 74
   hypokalemic and 16 (19%) of 82 hyperkalemic patients. The Kaplan-Meier
   survival rate was significantly longer in the hyperkalemic population
   (34.30 +/- 0.71 vs 31.06 +/- 1.16, p=0.055). Hypokalemia, when defined
   as serum potassium 5.5 pound mmol/l, was associated with all-cause
   mortality (hazards ratio (HR) 1.857, 95% CI 0.986-3.496, p = 0.051). The
   significance was lost in the model after adjustment for albumin level.
   Only albumin level determined mortality (p=0.03). Discussion: Lower
   potassium level was associated with all-cause mortality, but only as a
   confounding effect of malnutrition in dialysis patients
   Objectives: A new method to adhere biological tissue to another or to
   metal such as stainless steel using integrated low-level energy sources,
   heat, pressure, and vibration is proposed. Methods: Heat, pressure, and
   vibration are simultaneously delivered by pressing the porcine aorta
   tissues on the vibration plate with the heated tip. Tensile tests on
   adhered specimens were performed to determine adhesion characteristics
   to adhesion temperature, time, pressure, and vibration. The effect of
   metal surface coating, fluorine-doped DLC coating, on the adhesion
   strength was examined. In one application, the inlet port of a
   ventricular assist device adhered to a porcine ventricle muscle by
   applying the novel method with a temperature of 80 degrees Centigrade
   for 120 seconds. Sufficient adhesion was observed without additional
   vibration. In a second application, the vessel adhesion apparatus was
   developed to connect a bypass graft to a coronary artery. The device has
   both a heating and pressurizing part on the tip, which was used to
   attach the bypass graft to the coronary artery by applying heat with a
   temperature of 120 degrees Centigrade for 120 seconds. Results and
   Discussion: The maximal shear tensile strength using the proposed novel
   adhesion method was 200 kPa, which is half the strength of the porcine
   aorta. Adhesion strength increased in proportion to temperature, time,
   and pressure. The adhesion strength can be controlled by surface
   treatment of metals. In the first application, the inlet port adhered to
   the ventricle muscle with a shear tensile strength of 91 kPa, which is
   enough to keep the pump attached to the ventricle. In the second
   application, the bypass graft adhered to the coronary artery with a
   shear tensile strength of 50 kPa, which is sufficient to maintain
   attachment when exposed to normal blood pressure. The proposed adhesion
   method indicates satisfactory performance.
   Objectives: The requirements for safety and efficacy of medical devices
   are constantly increasing leading to higher costs and time to market.
   Simulations are proving to be particularly promising in accelerating the
   approval process and at the same time further increasing patient safety.
   The FDA related Medical Device Innovation Consortium predicts that in
   some years about 40% of the evidences for regulatory approval are coming
   from virtual patients and simulations. What is the status today and how
   do we get there? Methods: Simulations can improve the regulatory
   assessment in various phases of the product life cycle, e.g. to justify
   design adjustments, worst-case estimates of sizes and variants,
   definition of test loads for experiments, to perform virtual tests on a
   large number of patients/conditions or to identify the root cause of
   failure. This may especially be important in consideration of the future
   requirements of the MDR for patient-specific implants. Results: So far,
   the use of simulations was hindered by a lack of guidance and
   expectations within the medical device community. However, today the FDA
   and ASME are strongly supporting the use of this approach with new
   guidelines (guidance 1807) and a V&V standard (V&V40). "FDA's Office of
   Science and Engineering Laboratories has committed significant resources
   for transforming computational modeling from a valuable scientific tool
   to a valuable regulatory tool because of its potential for significant
   cost-savings in evaluating medical devices, simulating performance under
   scenarios that may not be possible with human use or that could more
   effectively be evaluated with simulation." Discussion: Computer-aided
   simulations have the potential to revolutionize the field of regulatory
   approval. However, it is crucial that the simulations are performed with
   care and its limitations are understood. To foster confidence and wider
   acceptance of in silico methods, a proper methodology is needed to
   ensure appropriate credibility.
   Objectives: TAVI is the treatment of severe aortic valve stenosis in
   elderly patients or in patients with too high risk for conventional
   surgery. CT-scan is mandatory for valve sizing. It requires injection of
   contrast medium that may cause or increase kidney failure. The study aim
   was to establish the accuracy of intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), a no
   contrast medium technique, for measurements of native aortic valve in
   patients undergoing TAVI. Values by IVUS were compared to CT-scan ones
   in the same patients. Methods: From June 2014 to January 2019 137
   consecutive patients (74 M, mean age 82.7 +/- 5.6 years) (Logistic
   EuroSCORE 22.7 +/- 14.9%; STS score mortality 21.3 +/- 13.7%) undergoing
   TAVI through femoral access were enrolled. Each patient had high
   resolution angio-CT for these measurements: diameter, perimeter, and
   area of the aortic annulus. In all patients, during procedure and before
   prosthetic valve implantation, a manual IVUS pullback, from left
   ventricular outflow tract to ascending aorta, was performed by 7F IVUS
   probe. On the recorded IVUS pullback, a second operator blind to CT
   measures sized minimum and maximum diameter, perimeter and area of the
   aortic annulus. In order to assess inter-rater concordance and agreement
   between CT and IVUS data, Bland-Altman analysis and Pearson's
   correlation were applied. A p value Results: A very strong correlation
   was found between the measures. Maximum diameter: CT 2.5 +/- 0.3 vs IVUS
   2.6 +/- 0.3 cm; r=+0.985; pDiscussion: These results prove the accuracy
   and reliability of aortic annulus measurements by IVUS compared to those
   by CT-scan. Sizing of the aortic annulus by IVUS only may be considered
   in patients likely to develop kidney failure due to contrast medium
   injection.
   Objectives: The long-term usage of rotary blood pumps is limited by the
   high amount of blood damage, which leads to a high number of adverse
   events. Most of the blood damage is generated in the gap between the
   rotor blades and the housing wall, the area with the highest stress load
   and very short exposure times. The damage is caused by both shear and
   normal forces on the blood components. The objective is to investigate
   the blood damage in this region by examining different gap geometries.
   The focus is the damage caused by high dynamic normal stresses and the
   comparison with the blood damage models. Methods: A section of the blade
   gap of an axial rotary blood pump was reconstructed on a microchannel
   chip, which is sealed with siliconized cover glasses. In additional
   channels the inlet and outlet rounding are varied between 0.05 and 0.6
   mm. The gap length and width are kept the same for all channels. A
   channel without a blade gap is integrated to determine the damage caused
   by the test stand. Flow simulations are carried out to determine the
   occurring stresses. The test stand consists of a syringe pump that
   transports 20 mL of human blood back and forth through the microchannels
   for up to 6 hours. Hemolysis is measured every half hour. Results: With
   the test stand it is possible to investigate the influence of different
   gap geometries on the blood damage under controlled conditions. The
   experiments demonstrated the influence of different inlet and outlet
   geometries on the hemolysis. The measured hemolysis was compared with
   the damage models. Discussion: With the test stand it is possible to
   simulate the stress loads in blade gaps on human blood. The influence of
   the high dynamic normal stresses on hemolysis can also be determined
   through variations of the inlet and outlet. It is therefore a
   well-suited tool for improving the corresponding damage models in the
   area of high dynamic stress loads. The findings allow the optimization
   of the region to further reduce blood damage caused by rotary blood
   pumps.
   Objectives: Cardiac grafts produced by combining human pluripotent stem
   cell (hPSC)-derivatives and tissue engineering are a promising
   therapeutic option for the replacement of cardiomyocytes (CM) lost due
   to myocardial infarction. Currently, the vascularization and maturation
   of such grafts are the most critical aspects. In addition to endothelial
   cells (EC), pericytes (PC) are known to play a crucial role in vessel
   development and stabilization. Methods: Here, an hPSC-derived PC
   differentiation protocol is shown as well as an in vitro model for the
   investigation of the role of PCs in hPSC-derived bioartificial cardiac
   tissues (BCT). Results: In the established differentiation protocol, the
   population giving rise to PCs (CD31-/PDGFR beta+) represented up to 94%
   of all cells and could be further purified via cell sorting. The
   obtained hPSC-PCs exhibited functional characteristics of PCs in
   co-culture assays, and showed similar gene expression profile to primary
   PCs. Differentiated hPSC-PCs were used w/ or w/o purified hPSC-ECs to
   generate BCTs and to address their effect on tissue morphology,
   metabolism, and electrophysiological parameters compared to control
   tissues containing primary fibroblasts (Fb). Interestingly, tissues with
   hPSC-PCs exhibited equivalent contraction forces compared to controls,
   but more organized sarcomere structures as well as improved longitudinal
   cell- and extracellular matrix orientation. Furthermore, the beating
   frequency and passive forces showed native-like values. Addition of
   hPSC-ECs resulted in spontaneously formed and maintained endothelial
   network structures, which were distributed throughout the BCTs and the
   involvement of PCs in such structures was demonstrated. Discussion: The
   characterized and functional hPSC-PCs together with hPSC-derived CMs and
   ECs represent a promising cell source for myocardial tissue replacement
   therapy. Their dual ability in supporting EC function and matrix
   remodeling during tissue maturation makes them a favorable candidate to
   replace primary Fbs.
   Objectives: High prevalence of thrombi around the Left Ventricular
   Assist Device (LVAD) cannula has been proven by pathological studies.
   Thrombogenic potential (TP) inside of the left ventricle (LV) is
   evaluated based on shear stress history (SSH) and residence time (RT) of
   particles; however, the effect of the atrial inflow - including rotation
   and uneven flow distribution of the pulmonary veins - is ignored. In
   this study, the influence of the atrial inflow on the TP was
   investigated via Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations.
   Methods: In a patient-specific left ventricle (LV) model under full LVAD
   support, the flow fields were simulated with three different inflow
   conditions: with perpendicular velocity to the inflow (LAper, flow rate:
   3.5l/min), with an additional rotational component at the inflow (LArot:
   35rpm) and with asymmetric inflow conditions (LAasym: 60%/40%
   left/right). Platelet motion was simulated with a combination of laminar
   and the Lagrangian methods for 7s. The TP value was calculated based on
   the RT and SSH of particles (0<TP<1, with higher values corresponding to
   higher risk). Results: The ventricular flow patterns were comparable for
   perpendicular and rotational inflows and different for asymmetric
   conditions. TP values were different for each of the atrial inflow
   conditions (LAasym: 0.37, LArot: 0.35, LAper: 0.4). The number of the
   particles with a SSH value more than 0.6 Pa center dot s (non-outlier
   range) increased for LAasym simulation (LAasym: 11%, LArot: 5%, LAper:
   3%;p<0.05); however the particles that remain for more than 7s inside
   the LV were higher for LAper simulation (LAasym: 13%, LArot: 18%, LAper:
   19%;p<0.05). Discussion: CFD is an advanced tool for the evaluation of
   ventricular flow during LVAD support; however, neglecting the atrial
   inflow conditions could lead to an inaccurate prediction of flow
   parameters linked to ventricular and pump thrombosis. Reliable
   evaluation of ventricular blood flow, therefore, requires the
   consideration of realistic atrial inflow conditions.
   Objectives: Thrombus formation is a major risk of implants with
   artificial materials in blood contact. This adhesion of blood platelets
   plays an important role in thrombus formation and is influenced by the
   electrochemical conditions of the surface. The objective of this
   research is to change the electrochemical conditions by applying a low
   voltage, high frequency alternating electrical current to the surface,
   in order to avoid the adhesion of the platelets involved in thrombus
   formation. Methods: Thin sheet samples with a thickness of 0.5 mm from
   different materials (titanium, stainless steel and copper) are attached
   to a high frequency generator and exposed to human whole blood under
   controlled flow conditions in an in vitro setting. An electrical current
   ranging from 50 mu A until 400 mu A in a frequency range from 10 kHz to
   100 kHz was applied. The deposition of the blood platelets on the
   surface is identified and quantified by using fluorescent microscopy and
   digital image processing. The thrombus formation and therefore the
   anti-thrombogenic effect of the method is investigated in respect to
   different generator settings for each material. Results: The
   characterization of all materials revealed changes of the surfaces in
   comparison to the zero samples. A differently pronounced reduction of
   thrombus formation with the proposed anti-thrombogenic method could be
   demonstrated on all three materials. Discussion: Though the method could
   improve the anti-thrombogenicity under certain conditions, the mechanism
   is not fully understood yet and the parameters are not optimized.
   Further investigations will also focus on possible side effects caused
   by potential structural changes of blood proteins.
   Objectives: Cationic liposomes OO4 (N-{6-amino-1-[N-(9Z)
   -octadec9-enylamino] -1-oxohexan-(2S) -2-yl} -N0- {2- [N,
   N-bis(2-aminoethyl) amino] ethyl} -2-hexadecylpropandiamide) and DOPE
   contain a higher amount of amino groups than classical lipids. A
   polyelectrolyte multilayer system (PEM) made of chondroitin sulphate
   (CS) and collagen type I (COL I) was prepared by Layer-by-Layer
   technique with liposomes embedded in the terminal layers for the
   controlled release of components to promote osteogenic differentiation
   for bone regeneration. Methods: Characterization of the PEM was
   performed using ellipsometry. This technique was used to investigate the
   thickness on substrate coated with PEM of CS, liposomes, COL I as
   terminal layer. The layer growth behavior of PEM was studied using
   Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR). The cell adhesion of C2C12 cells and
   the cellular uptake efficiency of the liposomes embedded onto PEM was
   evaluated using fluorescence staining and flow cytometry. Results: The
   SPR results showed a linear growth with an increase in the angle shift
   corresponding to the adsorbed mass of PEM. The increase in thickness
   after liposome adsorption was significant. The cell studies indicated
   that cells seeded on terminal liposome layer showed a higher amount of
   cells on the surface. The population of cells that took up liposomes are
   higher in the absence of serum than in medium with FBS. Discussion: The
   quantification of liposome uptake indicated that the population of cells
   that took up liposomes were higher in the absence of serum. The results
   showed the uptake efficiency of cationic liposomes embedded onto a PEM
   system for controlled release of hydrophobic and hydrophilic models
   compounds into the cells.
   Objectives: Many different tissue sealants are available on the market.
   BioGlue tissue sealants are produced by a bovine serum albumin treated
   intra-operatively with glutaraldehyde. Here we report a sterile
   peri-graft abscess formation, possibly caused as a reaction to the
   liberal use of BioGlue. Methods: A-54 years-old male patient underwent
   ascending aortic and hemiarch replacement for acute type A aortic
   dissection. Exceptionally, the anastomotic suture line was reinforced by
   application of BioGlue tissue sealant. The initial post-operative course
   was uneventful. After transfer to the general ward on day four the
   patient developed fever and an inflammatory syndrome. A broad spectrum
   antibiotherapy was started for a suspicion of pneumonia. In the
   following chest CT scan a suspicious peri-graft fluid collection was
   present. The patient underwent a surgical revision for acute
   mediastinitis rule out. During the procedure a whitish-milky liquid was
   found that differed macroscopically from a classical abscess. The chest
   was left open with a negative-pressure wound dressing. The patient
   became apyretic and the inflammatory markers normalized. After a one
   week follow-up with negative cultures and 3 consecutive dressing
   changes, the chest was closed and recovery uneventful. The patient was
   discharged to an outside hospital at six post-operative days. Results:
   All the samples which were analysed histologically and for different
   pathologic stains as well as and by broad spectrum culture analysis,
   remained negative throughout. At one month follow-up the patient
   remained well and without fever or inflammatory response. Discussion:
   Although several published case reports about tissue necrosis and
   anastomotic rupture following BioGlue use, the formation of a sterile
   abscess is a rare complication. In this patient, the peri-graft effusion
   might have been an allergy like inflammatory response to the bovine
   albumin within BioGlue. A prolonged postoperative mediastinal drainage
   when using BioGlue might prevent this rare complication.
   Objectives: The use of loop diuretics like furosemide is discussed in
   intensive care medicine regarding their clinical efficacy and safety.
   The hypothesis arose whether both parameters depend on the capability of
   serum albumin to transfer the drug to the kidneys. Methods: Serial blood
   & urine samples were taken from intensive care patients receiving
   furosemide infusions for volume overload. Free furosemide serum
   fractions & urine concentrations were determined by HPLC/LCMS. Albumin
   binding capacity (ABiC) was quantified by adding a binding site II
   (diazepam binding site) specific fluorescence marker (Dansylsarcosine,
   DS). The amount of unbound DS was detected by fluorescence analysis
   after ultrafiltration, corresponding with ABiC. Results: 62 patients
   were assessed. 50 patients (30male, 67,5 +/- 10,3 years) were included
   into statistical analysis. Main reasons for intensive care admission
   were sepsis (n=18) and perioperative care. Indications for furosemide
   were volume overload in acute or acute on chronic kidney injury (n=42),
   volume management in sepsis, ARDS or lung edema (n=8). ABiC was reduced
   to 65,2+/-12,2%, The free furosemide fraction (normal <5%) correlated
   negatively with ABiC (r -0,638, p<0,001) with 15,76+/-11,52% in those
   with ABIC<60% and 5,36+/-5,29% in ABiC 60% (p<0,001). The urinary
   fraction of furosemide (normal >65%) was significantly lower in those
   with ABiC <60% as compared to 60% (7,47+/-5,83% vs. 23,98+/-17,91,
   p<0,01). Furosemide induced increase in urine output was strongly
   correlated with ABiC (r=0,908, p<0,017). Discussion: Our results
   indicate a role of ABiC in the pharmacokinetics of furosemide, impacting
   its free serum fraction and urinary fraction. Data are suggestive for a
   link between status of the albumin-dependend drug carrier mechanism and
   the safety and efficacy of the drug. Clinicians will profit from our
   results regarding safe use of loop diuretics & furosemide responsiveness
   in patients with volume overload and kidney injury.
   Objectives: Albumin is a blood protein with various physiological
   functions as there are: maintenance of osmotic pressure, antioxidant and
   transport function for endogenous and exogenous ligands. Binding of
   these ligands can affect conformational changes of human serum albumin.
   Methods: The "Albumin-functionality-test" is based on EPR spectroscopy
   and detects modified binding and functional characteristics. The used
   radical supporting spin probe binds analogous ligands variably strong at
   different albumin binding sites and thus, serves as an indirect marker
   for serum albumin functionality with regard to its ability for binding,
   transport and detoxification. A comparison of three different mixtures
   of albumin and a spin-labeled fatty acid allows for the in vitro
   simulation of binding-, transport- and release-conditions by the
   Albumin-functionality-test. Thus, an "effective" albumin concentration
   could be determined. It quantifies the amount of functional albumin in
   the patient in comparison to healthy controls. Results: We applied
   Albumin-functionality-test to albumin preparations differing in redox
   state of cysteine-34, namely human mercaptalbumin (HMA), human
   non-mercaptalbumin1 (HNA1) and human non-mercaptalbumin2 (HNA2) and
   found differences in their functionality. The analysis of samples from
   patients with different states of liver failure showed a strong
   correlation of binding efficiency and detoxification efficiency,
   depending on the severity of the disease. Discussion: Due to the
   increasing numbers of studies using commercial albumin preparations for
   the treatment of patients with liver disease, we investigated different
   available albumin samples regarding their albumin functionality. We
   found dramatically reduced binding and detoxification efficiencies. Our
   findings might be used for patient selection and prognoses for
   personalized therapies. Taken together, these results might affect the
   importance of albumin from the patient view and refer to its stability
   as a drug.
   Objectives: The analysis of Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD) power
   is a commonly used method to identify complications such as pump
   thrombosis. However, the LVAD power is also affected by different
   influences like the circadian rhythm. To optimize our thrombosis
   detection algorithm, we analyzed LVAD log files. Methods: For the
   investigation of power behavior in LVAD log files, we retrospectively
   analyzed 840 log files from 189 patients. Each patient received an HVAD
   (HeartWare). The log files contain on average 3000 power values
   collected over a period of appx. 31 days. None of the analyzed log files
   contained serious complications, such as a pump thrombosis. Results: To
   show a significant difference between the power values of the daytime (8
   am-10 pm) and the night-time, a statistical test (significance level:
   5%) was carried out. 813 of 840 log files showed a significant
   difference (average t = 16.94). In addition, the average difference
   between the maximum and the minimum power value of a day was calculated
   for each day (average: 1071.9mW, SD: 158.2mW, range: 497.1mW -
   2299.5mW). Furthermore, the average power was calculated for each day
   and log file. To get a measure for the fluctuation in daily average of
   power development within a log file, the SD has been calculated (SD
   average: 65.3mW, range 10.4mW - 435.9mW). Discussion: The retrospective
   analysis of LVAD log files shows that power behavior is individual.
   Although most patients show a significant power difference between
   daytime and night-time hours, the maximum difference of a day and the
   average power changes over several days varies from patient to patient.
   A patient-specific power model, considering the circadian rhythm, was
   developed and applied to our thrombosis detection algorithms, which
   achieved a better thrombosis detection time of up to 93 hours compared
   to the LVAD controller alarming algorithm.
   Objectives: Suppression of membrane fouling is an important key
   technology for the development of portable and implantable artificial
   kidneys. Among several factors known to affect membrane fouling, we
   focused on the blood flow condition. In the present study, to clarify
   the effect of pulsatile and non-pulsatile blood flow on membrane
   fouling, an ex vivo hemofiltration experiment using porcine blood was
   carried out. Methods: Hemofiltration with filtrate recycling was
   performed under three conditions; pulsatile flow using a roller pump,
   non-pulsatile flow using a roller pump with three chambers to stabilize
   the flow, and non-pulsatile flow using a centrifugal pump. The blood
   flow rate (QB) was set at 50 or 100 mL/min and the maximum filtration
   rate at which irreversible membrane fouling would not occur was
   determined as follows; the first filtration rate (QF) was set at 2.5% of
   the QB for one hour (baseline), increased by 2.5% to 5% of the QB for
   one hour, and then returned to the baseline value for 20 min, and the
   transmembrane pressure (TMP) was measured to check if it had returned to
   the baseline value. This step was repeated until the QF reached 25% of
   the QB. Results: For both blood flow rates (50 and 100 mL/min), the
   maximum filtration flow rate at which the TMP did not return to the
   baseline, implying that irreversible membrane fouling had occurred, was
   higher under the non-pulsatile flow conditions than under the pulsatile
   flow condition. Discussion: The flow rate and the TMP changed
   periodically under the pulsatile flow condition and the peak TMP value
   was higher than that under the non-pulsatile flow condition, which
   increases the burden on the membrane. Thus, there is an increased
   likelihood of membrane fouling, as compared to the constant the pressure
   under the non-pulsatile flow condition.
   Objectives: The objective is to develop a simulator of the anatomy and
   hemodynamics of the radial artery in order to design a robust controller
   for a noninvasive, continuous blood pressure measurement method.
   Currently, blood pressure, in intensive care units, is measured
   invasively, which can lead to complications (e.g. infections). The novel
   approach facilitates a continuous noninvasive flow measurement, in
   addition to the instantaneous blood pressure measurement. Methods:
   During measurements, a controller pneumatically adjusts the pressure in
   a balloon, positioned on top of the radial artery, so that the Doppler
   derived flow in the radial artery is reduced to a constant target value.
   The resulting pressure in the balloon correlates with the blood
   pressure. For the development of this method, a simulator, modelling the
   anatomical conditions of the lower arm, was constructed. The simulator
   was designed to create arbitrary physiological pressure curves. For the
   validation of the simulator, invasively measured blood pressure curves
   and data found in literature related to the mass flow rates were
   compared to the curves created by the simulator. Results: The pressure
   curve, created with the simulator, shows a deviation of less than 5 % to
   the invasively measured blood pressure. The mass flow rate shows a good
   agreement with the literature data. The simulator is capable of
   simulating blood pressure curves with a mean arterial pressure of 40
   mmHg to 120 mmHg. First tests with the controller have shown that it is
   possible to control the pulsatile flow to the constant target flow rate.
   Discussion: Regarding the simulator, the next step is to adjust it, so
   that it can simulate flows above a mean pressure of 120 mmHg. Regarding
   the controller, stress tests must be conducted. It must be evaluated
   whether it is robust enough to work with pressure curves that fluctuate
   in mean pressure and frequency.
   Objectives: Relative blood volume (RBV) changes during haemodialysis are
   typically estimated from variations in haematocrit, haemoglobin or total
   blood protein measured by optical, acoustic or other sensors integrated
   in the dialysis circuit. Due to dynamic changes in the circulation
   during the initial phase of dialysis (following filling of the
   extracorporeal circuit with the patient's blood and starting dialyzer
   ultrafiltration), the indications of RBV monitors depend on the exact
   moment of starting RBV measurements. The aim of this study was to assess
   this issue quantitatively using a mathematical modelling approach.
   Methods: The developed compartmental model describes the flow of blood
   across the cardiovascular system and the extracorporeal circuit combined
   with the whole-body transport of water and the most important
   osmotically active solutes and the baroreflex mechanisms. The model was
   validated using clinical data from patients on maintenance HD. A
   standard 4-hour HD session with 3 L ultrafiltration was studied for a
   virtual reference patient with all model parameters based on the
   literature data. RBV changes were derived from the simulated haematocrit
   (HCT) changes. Two cases were analysed: the priming saline being infused
   to the patient or discarded. Results: For the case when the priming
   saline was infused to the patient, the total RBV reduction at the end of
   the simulated dialysis session varied between 8 % (when HCT changes were
   monitored from the very beginning of dialysis) and 13 % (when HCT
   monitoring was started circa 4 minutes later). For the case when the
   priming saline was discarded, the analogous difference in RBV reduction
   was less than 1 percentage point. Discussion: When the priming saline is
   infused to the patient, a few minute difference in the moment of
   starting RBV measurements may significantly affect the indicated RBV
   changes, which is due to the dilution of blood by the infused saline and
   the time it takes for the uniform mixing of blood across the circulatory
   system.
   We have developed autologous in vivo tissue engineered vascular grafts
   (in vivo TEVG, i.e. BIOTUBE) mainly composed of fibroblasts and collagen
   constructed in the patients' subcutaneous tissues. After long term
   animal experiments over 5 years, we clinically applied them to the
   congenital heart surgery of a 2-year-old child as a pulmonary artery
   patch plasty material in 2015. Three years after implantation, 3D-CT
   exhibited neither aneurysmal dilatation, significant calcification, nor
   shrinkage of the patch graft interfering the growth of the pulmonary
   artery. The clinical course was good without any significant
   complications over 4 years presently. However, since the tissue
   formation largely depends on the regenerative ability of the host,
   individual differences exist, and it is an issue to secure the
   mechanical reliability of the grafts formed in high-risk patients. We
   are currently evaluating the changes in mechanical properties of TEVGs
   by chemical treatment, and are examining whether it is possible to
   improve mechanical durability. In addition, in order to fabricate the
   TEVGs in healthy individuals as allogeneic (parents) or xenogeneic
   tissue substitutes, we are conducting transplantation experiments on
   decellularized tissues. The in vivo TEVGs could also be applied to
   AV-shunts. However, in the animal pilot experiments, significant
   stenosis was observed at the anastomosis with host vein resulting in
   early occlusion probably because of high sheer stresses. The attempts to
   overcome the problems by several investigators are also reviewed.
   Objectives: To evaluate different designs or insertion techniques of
   cochlear implant electrode carriers (ECs) insertion forces are measured
   by a force sensor, which is mounted directly underneath an artificial
   cochlea model (aCM) leading to a summed force profile. One of the next
   steps in CI research leads from post-experimental evaluation of measured
   insertion force profiles to pre-experimental predictions of these
   profiles using analytical models based on an improved knowledge about
   factors impacting the insertion forces. Three likely factors were chosen
   for further investigation: speed, EC stiffness and curvature of the aCM.
   Methods: Three aCM were fabricated out of PTFE blocks, each model having
   one constant curvature (r = 6.4 / 8.5 / 12.7 mm). Additionally EC
   substitutes were fabricated using a two-component silicone, all with a
   constant diameter (0.7 mm), a total length of 20.5 mm and embedded bare
   copper wires. In order to vary the stiffness of the EC substitutes, one
   type had four and the other six wires embedded. They were inserted into
   the aCM with three different insertion speeds ( v = 0.11 / 0.4 / 1.6
   mm/s). In order to increase reproducibility, insertions were conducted
   using an automated insertion test bench, comprising a linear actuator to
   clamp the EC substitutes and move them into the aCM and the force sensor
   underneath the model. Results: In accordance with theoretical
   considerations all varied factors showed effects on the insertion force
   profiles. Increased insertion speed and sample stiffness increased the
   insertion forces, whereas an increased model radius decreased the
   insertion forces. Discussion: The variance of measured forces within one
   set of parameters is due to the manual fabrication of samples and may be
   decreased by usage of commercial ECs. The influence of lubricants has to
   be analysed within future experiments.
   Objectives: The purpose of this work is to design and create a high
   efficiency inductive powering unit (IPU) for a wide range of implantable
   devices and artificial organs (AO). Methods: A possible way to realize
   wireless powering is to use inductive energy transfer systems. To
   maximize overall system efficiency class E power amplifier is widely
   used due to its 100% efficiency in the ideal case. But maximum
   efficiency can be achieved only if input and output system parameters
   will remain constant during IPU operation. Inductive coils have nonzero
   distance between them because of patient's tissue thickness. It is worth
   noting that tissue thickness is different for every patient: the
   difference may be several millimeters. Moreover, this value can change
   during IPU operation as a result of patient's motor activity or tissue
   edema which will lead to PA detuning and decreasing efficiency. To avoid
   PA's detuning, frequency tuning systems can be used. There are two
   approaches for tuning systems that can be found in the literature. The
   first uses voltage and/or current levels of important circuit nodes to
   estimate system status. This method is good and quite simple, but
   requires external control signals that means additional power losses and
   decreased efficiency. The other method uses the phase of the voltage
   signals from important nodes and consumes less power. The second method
   was chosen by authors to design a tuning system. Results: During this
   work, a calculation method for PA and the frequency tuning system were
   designed. The experimental prototype was created. The authors of this
   article obtained an overall system efficiency of more than 60 % for
   three different coil sets and output power from 0.7 W to 1 W for same
   coil sets and range of axial misalignments from 10 to 20 mm. Discussion:
   The high efficiency inductive powering system for AO has been designed
   and tested during this work.
   Objectives: Native arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is the preferred vascular
   access for hemodialysis (HD), but it still fails in more than 40% cases
   within the first year. Stenosis is the main cause of AVF failure, but
   its detection and prediction are still open clinical challenges. The
   purpose of our study was to explore the potential of using sound
   analysis to reveal unique characteristics in AVF sounds and to detect
   potentially relevant changes over time. Methods: We acquired the sounds
   of 10 AVFs, 7 referred by the nephrologists as well-functioning and 3 as
   stenotic AVFs. We also acquired the sound of 1 AVF characterized by
   severe stenosis and we repeated the recording after surgical revision.
   Sounds were recorded using the Littmann Electronic Stethoscope 3200
   using wide mode. Sounds were transmitted via Bluetooth to a laptop and
   frequency spectra were obtained using an in-house Matlab code embedding
   the Fast Fourier Transform and a high-pass filter with a cutoff
   frequency of 50 Hz, aimed at attenuating stethoscope's noise and heart
   sounds' frequencies. Results: In well-functioning AVFs we consistently
   found a low-frequency peak, located in the bandwidth 100-200 Hz, while
   no relevant spectral features were present at higher frequencies. On the
   other hand, stenotic AVFs showed high-frequency peaks, located in the
   bandwidth of 500-600 Hz. In the AVF with severe stenosis we found
   high-frequency peaks in the bandwidth 700-750 Hz, which were replaced by
   low-frequency peaks after AVF revision. Discussion: Sound analysis
   revealed unique characteristics in the frequency spectra of AVFs,
   allowing an objective discrimination between well-functioning and
   stenotic AVFs. This technique may bring the advantage of limiting
   clinician's skill-dependency and personal interpretation. Despite being
   preliminary, our results suggest that sound analysis may be used to
   detect stenosis development and allow patients' self-monitoring,
   resulting in early prediction of AVF failure.
   Objectives: Biofilms on percutaneous leads of implanted blood pumps can
   cause severe infections. By treating infections with antibiotics over a
   long period of time, bacteria develop resistance. Today, in a clinical
   setting, antibiotic resistance is determined in-vitro for all available
   drugs. The aim of the EvolChip project is to predict the probabilities
   of resistances that might evolve and suggest combinations of antibiotics
   that slow down or even prevent future resistance. Methods: The EvolChip
   reactor consists of an agar plate that serves as a diffusion and growth
   medium. Three membranes permit diffusion of active substances from
   microfluidic channels into the agar medium. Two of these channels serve
   as sources for different antibiotics, the third one as the sink. As a
   result, two overlapping drug gradients establish, with a low
   concentration near the sink and high concentration close to the sources.
   Antibiotics were mixed with a nutrient solution to promote bacteria
   migration towards higher concentrated areas. The bacteria contain a
   green fluorescent protein gene, which enables real-time tracking via
   polarisation filters and a camera. Results: In preliminary experiments,
   the gradient course could be characterized by making use of fluorescent
   markers. Only resistant bacteria migrated towards the sources with high
   antibiotic concentration. The spatial distribution of bacteria
   facilitates the identification of optimal concentration ratios and
   mixtures of antibiotics. In addition, the speed of resistance evolution
   with respect to different antibiotic mixtures was determined.
   Discussion: The proposed EvolChip concept showed promising results in
   preliminary experiments. Further geometries, growth media, and bacteria
   will be tested. In order to validate the method, patient strains with
   known treatment and resistance history will be compared to the
   predictions of the presented method.
   Objectives: Due to the growing demand for organs in liver
   transplantation, techniques for optimization of suboptimal livers are
   needed such as normotermic liver perfusion (PNT). In this way, hepatic
   repercussion of ischaemic preconditioning (PI) still remains unclear.
   This study aims to analyze the haemodynamic and biochemical alterations
   produced after intraoperative PI on livers subjected to 6 hours of PNT.
   As a secondary objective, we aim to determine the effect of PI on liver
   function. Methods: Eight minipig livers, randomized to control (n=4) and
   PI group (n=4), were perfused during six hours in a PNT circuit (34oC).
   The PI group was subjected to 10 minutes of ischaemia by means of a
   Pringle manoeuvrein the hepatic hilum, followed by 10 minutes of
   reperfusion. Biochemical and gasometric parameters were measured at
   baseline and hourly in perfusate. Pressures and flows in hepatic artery
   (HA) and portal vein (PV) were registered. For statistical analysis
   Spearman's rho test and Mann-Whitney U test was performed, considering p
   < 0,05 as significant. Results: There were significant differences in HA
   flow, adjusted to weight, doubling the control group (PI 0,42 +/- 0,17
   ml/min/g Vs GC 0,17 +/- 0,05 ml/min/g; p=0,000); no differences were
   found in PV flow. Total proteins (PI 1,9 [1,7-2]g/dL Vs GC 1,3
   [0,95-1,5]g/dL; p=0,000) and O-2 consumption rate (PI 0,086
   [0,055-0,113] ml/min/g Vs GC 0,040 [0,017-0,060]ml/min/g; p=0,000)were
   significantly increased in the PI group. There were no significant
   differences in AST, ALT, or GGT. Discussion: The PI, as a previous
   maneuver to PNT, increases hepatic artery flow and O2 consumption
   without altering citolytic parameters in liver. This may improve hepatic
   functionality as a previous step in transplantation. Further molecular
   and histological study should be made to clarify our finding in PI on
   PNT.

   (Co70Si12B9)(1-x-y)FexNby alloys has been studied by X-ray diffraction
   and transmission electron microscopy in a wide composition region. The
   formation of the bcc structures in both the alloy groups is shown to be
   substantially dependent on the alloying component concentrations. The
   bcc phase is found to form in the cobalt-based alloys in the
   concentration region, where it was not observed before. In the
   cobalt-based alloys, the bcc phase appears at a niobium concentration
   higher than 1 at % and the average bcc nanocrystal size varies from 40
   nm (at 1 at % Nb) to 14 nm (at 5 at % Nb). In the Fe-based alloys,
   nanocrystals with the bcc lattice form at the copper concentrations of
   0.45-1 at %, and the average nanocrystal size is dependent on the alloy
   composition and varies in the range 16-24 nm. The causes of the

AB Sintering of oxides and carbonates at 1400 degrees C gives crystalline
   high-entropy single phase products with a BaFe12O19 (magnetoplumbite)
   structure containing 5 doping elements at high concentration level:
   Ba(Fe6Ti1.2Co1.2In1.2Ga1.2Cr1.2)O-19. The complete list of explored
   substitutions includes K, Ca, Sr, Pb, La, Bi, Al, Ga, In, Ti, V, Cr, Mn,
   Co, and Ni. Loading to the batch more than 5 dopants or introduction of
   NiO, or V2O5 initiates formation of second phases like spinels or
   vanadates. Bi2O3 and K2O are too volatile at sintering temperature and
   were evaporated from the samples.
   Due to large ionic radius, the In3+ cation is likely to be incorporated
   not only on Fe3+ sites, but also on Ba2+ sites, that follow from
   resulting crystal composition. The smallest di-valent and tri-valent
   cations, Sr2+ and Al3+, are found to preferably concentrate together in
   the same magnetoplumbite phase crystals within one sample.
   According to elemental analysis of selected hexagonal crystals in the
   investigated 8 doped samples the most prospective compositions for
   obtaining high-entropy single phase with magnetoplumbite structure can
   be formulated as (Ca,Sr,Ba,Pb,La)Fe-x(Al,Ga,In,Ti,Cr,Mn,CO)(12.x)O-19

AB The manufacturing process of multiport extrusion tubes generally
   includes homogenization, extrusion, roll leveling and heat treatment. In
   order to investigate the influence of the manufacturing procedures on
   strength variation of multiport extrusion tubes made of A1100 and A3102
   alloys, the tube fabrication experiments and following materials
   characterization are carried out. The alloys' stress-strain curves after
   every processing procedure are measured, and pressure-bearing capacity
   of the tubes is tested. The tubes' strength and pressure-bearing
   capacity reach the peak values after straightening process and drop to
   the minimum after annealing. The contributions of solid solution
   hardening, grain boundary hardening and constituent particle
   strengthening to yield strength are evaluated. It is deduced that
   cluster hardening is the dominant strengthening mechanism for the
   as-homogenized and as-extruded samples; the contribution of clusters is
   second to work hardening after straightening process; slight cold work
   in conjunction with high-temperature annealing accelerates abnormal
   grain growth. The loss of strength increment from clusters can be
   interpreted by the remarkable reduction of high-angle grain boundaries
   after abnormal grain growth.

AB As a fundamental concept, lattice distortion is one of the four core
   effects in high entropy alloys (HEAs). However, there were few
   experimental evidences that directly observed the lattice distortion in
   HEAs. In this work, the experimental observation of lattice distortion
   in a new developed Fe(33)Mn(13)Co(22)Cr(15)Ni(17)HEA by multiple tilting
   selected area electron diffraction (SAED) was reported. SAED observation
   of 51 zone axes were performed in a single grain of the HEA sample.
   Among them, 24 normal diffraction patterns and 27 anomalous diffraction
   patterns with extra diffraction spots around the normal reflection spots
   were observed. According to the proportional relationship between the
   extra diffraction spots and the normal ones, the extra diffraction spots
   could be indexed with three non-integral Miller indices. The anomalous
   diffraction patterns were considered as the effect of reciprocal space
   lattice distortion, resulting in a relrod extension on the order of half
   of the reciprocal space lattice constant. The existence of numerous
   extended reciprocal relrod suggested that serious lattice distortion
   occurred in concerned HEA, and it significantly affected the
   transformation from direct lattice to reciprocal lattice.

   Al-Co-Cr-Cu-Fe-Ni system. We fabricated several alloys with hardness 10%

   seven experiments. We find that a strategy using both the compositions
   and descriptors based on a knowledge of the properties of HEAs,
   outperforms that merely based on the compositions alone. This strategy
   offers a recipe to rapidly optimize multi-component systems, such as
   bulk metallic glasses and superalloys, towards desired properties. (C)

   (Fe0.25Co0.25Ni0.25Cr0.125Mo0.125)(86-89)B11-14 amorphous (am) alloys is
   examined to develop new structural materials with low B contents. The
   crystallization of 116 alloy occurs in three stages: first nanoscale bcc
   precipitates form in the amorphous matrix, second nanoscale fcc
   precipitates form, and the residual amorphous phase disappears in the
   third stage which yields borides in addition to the bcc and fcc phases.
   Crystallization of 14B alloy is the same, except that the order of
   appearance of bcc and fcc is reversed. The bcc and fcc particle
   diameters are 5-15 nm and remain almost unchanged up to similar to 960
   K. On annealing, ultrahigh hardness of 1500-1550 (unprecedented for
   boride-free structures) is attained just before the third
   crystallization stage. This hardening and the thermal stability of the
   novel [am + bcc + fcc] structures are remarkable at such low boron
   content and encouraging for development as ultrahigh-strength alloys.
   The results are interpreted in terms of the nature and extent of
   partitioning of elemental components between the bcc/fcc phases and the
   amorphous matrix, and the size and defect structures of the bcc and fcc
   precipitates. The magnetic flux density at room temperature increases by
   precipitation of bcc and decreases by appearance of fcc. Slower
   quenching of the 11B alloy shows a pseudo-polymorphic crystallization
   that may be characteristic of multicomponent HE systems. (C) 2019 Acta

   radio-engineering carbonyl iron powder with average particle size d =
   3.5 mu m, the NPE-1 nickel powder with d = 150 mu m, the PK-1u cobalt
   powder with d < 71 mu m, the PKh-1M chromium powder with d < 125 mu m,
   and the MR0 manganese powder with d < 400 mu m. The MA of the prepared
   mixture was performed in an AGO-2 water-cooled mechanical activator
   using 9-mm steel balls with an acceleration of 90 g in air. The alloying
   time varies from 5 to 90 min. The ratio of the ball weight to the
   mixture weight is 20 : 1. X-ray diffraction patterns of the initial and
   alloyed mixtures, as well as of the sample formed by sintering, are
   recorded using a DRON 3M diffractometer in FeK alpha radiation at 2
   theta = 30-100 degrees. The microstructure of the mixture particles and
   the compact sample metallographic specimen after sintering are
   investigated by scanning electron microscopy. It is established that the
   peaks of initial components are absent in the X-ray diffraction pattern
   after mechanical activation for 90 min, and peaks corresponding to the
   phase representing the gamma-Fe-based solid solution having a
   face-centered crystal lattice are presented. Herewith, the fraction of
   the amorphous phase increases to 20%. A compact single-phase material is
   formed from the mixture prepared after 90-min alloying by spark plasma
   sintering at 800 degrees C for 10 min. Its density is 7.49 kg/cm(3),
   resistivity is 0.94-0.96 x 10(-6) Omega m, and microhardness is 306-328

AB Hydrogen sensors are a prerequisite for the implementation of a hydrogen
   economy due to the high flammability of hydrogen-air mixtures. They are
   to comply with the increasingly stringent requirements set by
   stakeholders, such as the automotive industry and manufacturers of
   hydrogen safety systems, where sensor deactivation is a severe but
   widely unaddressed problem. In response, we report intrinsically
   deactivation-resistant nanoplasmonic hydrogen sensors enabled by a
   rationally designed ternary PdAuCu alloy nanomaterial, which combines
   the identified best intrinsic attributes of the constituent binary Pd
   alloys. This way, we achieve extraordinary hydrogen sensing metrics in
   synthetic air and poisoning gas background, simulating real application
   conditions. Specifically, we find a detection limit in the low ppm
   range, hysteresis-free response over 5 orders of magnitude hydrogen
   pressure, subsecond response time at room temperature, long-term
   stability, and, as the key, excellent resistance to deactivating species
   like carbon monoxide, notably without application of any protective
   coatings. This constitutes an important step forward for optical
   hydrogen sensor technology, as it enables application under demanding
   conditions and provides a blueprint for further material and performance
   optimization by combining and concerting intrinsic material assets in
   multicomponent nanoparticles. In a wider context, our findings highlight
   the potential of rational materials design through alloying of multiple
   elements for gas sensor development, as well as the potential of
   engineered metal alloy nanoparticles in nanoplasmonics and catalysis.

AB The decrease in the X-ray diffraction Bragg peak intensity from
   concentrated multicomponent alloys (CMA), has been modeled in literature
   akin to the effect of temperature. In the current work, experiments and
   computations are used to comprehend the effect of atomic disorder in CMA
   on the Bragg peaks of powder diffraction patterns. Ni-Co-Fe-Cr-Mn and
   Cu-Ni-Co-Fe-V have been used as model systems for the study. It is
   proved that the intensity decrease is not insignificant, but is not
   anomalous either. A recipe is evolved to compare the Bragg peak
   intensities across the alloys of a CMA. It is demonstrated that it is
   incorrect to model the effect of an increase in atomic disorder in a
   CMA, as a temperature effect. A 'good measure' of lattice distortion is
   identified and further it is established that full width half maximum is
   a good measure of the bond length distortion. It is demonstrated that
   the true strain due to bond length distortion is of significantly lower
   magnitude than that given by a priori measures of lattice strain. In the
   scheme of categorization of defects in crystals, it is argued that CMA
   is a separate class (as distinct from type-I and type-II defects); which
   should be construed as a defected solid, rather than a defect in a
   solid.

   phase exists in the as-cast and 800 degrees C annealed

   degrees C. With the increase of the Co content, the D0(24) phase
   gradually transforms to the C14 phase and the alloy hardness increased.
   The microhardness of the alloy gradually decreases with the increase of
   annealing temperature. The maximum hardness of the as-cast alloys can
   achieve 1044 HV, while that for 800 and 1000 degrees C annealed alloys
   is 1027 and 956 HV, respectively.

AB A glass-type alloy with glass transition (GT) and supercooled liquid
   region was formed at a limited Ag/Co content ratio around 1.2 in
   melt-spun Zr65Al7.5Co27.5-xAgx (x = 5-20 at%) alloys. This alloy
   crystallized through two-stage exothermic reactions where an icosahedral
   (I) phase appears as a primary precipitation phase, followed by the
   second-stage reaction from glass + I-phase to four crystalline phases.
   The I-phase has a spherical morphology and its size is about 8 nm. The
   Zr65Al7.5Co17.5Ag10 alloy without GT keeps a glass-like structure even
   after heating for 3.6 ks at 750 K above the first exothermic peak,
   indicating the formation of a cluster-like glassy phase. The
   Zr(65)Al(7.5)Co(17.5)Ag(10 )alloy rod keeps a glassy phase in the
   diameter up to 1.7 mm, though the rod does not show the first-stage
   exothermic reaction. These features are the same as those for the
   annealed ribbons, indicating that a clustered glassy phase is also
   formed for the bulk alloy. This alloy satisfies with the formation
   criterion of the clustered glassy phase, i.e., large atomic size
   mismatch and positive heat of mixing for solute elements. The high
   stability of glassy phase leading to the formation of the clustered
   glassy phase is due to the resistance to atomic rearrangement of unlike
   Co and Ag elements. The Zr65Al7.5Co15.5Ag15 alloy exhibits the lowest
   decomposition temperature (T-x) and the highest hardness, being opposite
   to the previous relation for hardness to increase with increasing T-x.
   The relationship between GT and I-phase precipitation suggests that the
   GT is attributed to the development of I-like medium-range ordered
   structure. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A convenient procedure to synthesize highly dispersed Ni1-xPdx alloys
   has been developed. The procedure is based on thermal decomposition in
   the reducing atmosphere of specially synthesized multicomponent
   precursor. The formation of single-phase solid solutions in the entire
   range of palladium concentrations was confirmed by powder XRD. The
   alloys have a porous structure composed of grains whose size depends on
   the synthesis temperature. The study of the catalytic properties of
   Ni(1-x)Pd(x )alloys (5 wt% Pd) showed their high activity in the
   1,2-dichloroethane decomposition process. After 5 h of catalytic
   experiment the yield of carbon material was 160 g(C)/g(cat) for
   Ni1-xPdx. This is more than 3 times higher than the yield of reference
   samples (porous Ni, Ni-Co, Ni-Cu). The carbon material formed has a
   segmented fibrous structure. It is characterized by high morphological
   uniformity. The specific surface area of the obtained carbon material is
   580 m(2)/g. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   (HEAs) is reported. PtAuPdRhRu alloy (HEA), quaternary PtAuPdRh alloy,
   and ternary PtAuPd alloy NPs are produced with approximate to 3 nm in
   diameter. Taking advantage of the acoustic cavitation phenomenon in
   ultrasonication process, noble metal precursors could be co-reduced by
   chemical reductants and transform to alloy structures under operation at
   room conditions. The instantaneous massive energy (approximate to 5000
   degrees C, 2000 atm) occurring in momentary timespans (10(-9) s)
   contributes to the formation of multimetallic mixed nanomaterials driven
   by entropy maximization. Owing to strong synergistic effects, the
   catalysts with the HEA NPs supported on carbons exhibit prominent
   electrocatalytic activities for hydrogen evolution reaction.

AB The ability to simulate the oxidation behavior of multicomponent alloys
   is a powerful tool for alloy development and oxidation research. The
   present work shows how the DICTRA module of Thermo-Calc can be applied
   to reproduce composition profiles in NiCoCrAl alloys during Al2O3 scale
   growth when used in conjunction with appropriate Calphad thermodynamic
   and diffusion mobility databases. Profiles were calculated in pure
   oxidation and oxidation-dissolution regimes to simulate reaction in air
   and in a molten silicate. For each regime, a simple analytical
   expression was used to set the outward Al flux at the alloy surface as a
   boundary condition. The simulations were performed using different
   combinations of thermodynamic and diffusion mobility databases, which
   demonstrated the relative importance of the thermodynamic and kinetic
   contributions to the interdiffusion coefficients, and in turn to the
   concentration profiles. The simulations done with the developmental
   NISTCoNi-mob mobility database were found to be in good agreement with
   experimental data, while those done with MOBNI4 significantly
   underestimated Al depletion (and Co, Cr and Ni enrichment), due in part
   to an incomplete description of diffusivity in the Co-Ni binary system.
   All the tested thermodynamic databases yielded similar results. This
   work provides a quantitative illustration of the importance of
   critically assessed diffusion mobility descriptions in designing
   oxidation-resistant materials.

AB Three-, four-, and five-component host/guest crystals with multi-color
   and white light emission is described. Our strategy is based on the
   confinement of aromatic donor guests in supramolecular acceptor hosts.
   The supramolecular acceptor hosts (NDI-TPFB) were composed of
   N,N'-dipyrid-3-yl-1,4,5,8- naphthalenediimide (NDI) with two
   tris(pentafluorophenyl) borane (TPFB) linked by boron-nitrogen dative
   bonds as Lewis acid-base pairs, which spontaneously formed upon mixing
   the components. In the first part, a set of three-component crystals
   with 14 different aromatic guests were characterized to elucidate the
   structure-property relationships. In the latter part, a series of 17
   types of four-and fivecomponent crystals were formed with the use of
   binary or ternary guest inclusion systems, and their structural and
   photophysical properties were investigated. Among them, 14 types of
   crystals were formed effectively without destroying the crystal
   structure, as determined by X-ray diffraction and fluorescence
   microscopy. Notably, flexible color tuning, including white light
   emission, was realized by tuning the guest ratio and the combinations.
   Various intermolecular interactions such as C-H center dot center dot
   center dot F interactions, pi-pi stacking, charge-transfer interactions,
   and inclusion phenomena were important for forming the crystals. This
   approach that yields a rational solution of multicomponent crystals
   could be potentially useful for obtaining novel photofunctional
   solid-state systems.

AB The superior mechanical performance of ultra-high strength low carbon
   steel was attained through the co-precipitation strengthening and
   lath-martensitic microstructure refinement. The research results showed
   that the precipitates enriched with Cu, Ni, Mn and Al were observed at
   525 degrees C aging by atom probe tomography (APT), the face-centered
   cubic (FCC) Ni3Al phase precipitated from matrix firstly, and then the
   body-centered cubic (BCC) Cu-rich precipitates nucleated on the surface
   of Ni3Al particles to form composite precipitation phase of nanoscale
   Ni3Al and Cu particles eventually. The co-precipitation strengthening
   increment of nanoscale Cu and Ni3Al particles was calculated as 413 MPa.
   With the addition of multiple micro-alloyed elements, such as Nb, Ti and
   Mo, a relatively high amount of (Nb, Ti, Mo)C nanoscale co-precipitates
   below 10 nm were obtained in the matrix aged at 525 degrees C. The
   substitution of Mo for Nb, Ti would decelerate the coarsening kinetics
   of (Nb,Ti)C and cause high amount of finer precipitates. While those
   fine (Nb, Ti) C particles could evidently impede the grain growth, the
   finer martensitic blocks were subsequently obtained at 820 degrees C
   quenching, and the grain size and effective grain size were 5.6 mu m and
   3.08 mu m in this condition, respectively. In this research, the
   Ni-Al-Cu steel with best matching of strength and toughness has been
   achieved when it was aged at 600 degrees C after 820 degrees C
   quenching, the yield strength and -80 degrees C impact toughness could
   reach 1138 MPa and 74 J, respectively.

AB In this work, the preparation, high temperature oxidation and hot

   Nb-Ti-Si based alloy have been reported. By boronizing of the Si-Y
   co-deposition silicide coating, part of (Nb,X)Si-2 layer was transformed
   into (Nb,X)B-2 by a replacement reaction between the active B atom and
   (Nb,X)Si-2. Isothermal oxidation resistance tests showed that the
   as-prepared coating can provide good oxidation resistance both at an
   intermediate temperature of 850 degrees C and a high oxidation
   temperature of 1250 degrees C. The oxidation kinetics of the coating
   followed the parabolic law at both temperatures. After 100 h of exposure
   at 850 and 1250 degrees C, the mass gains are 1.35 and 4.05 mg/cm(2)
   respectively. The good oxidation resistance of the composite coating
   should be attributed to the formation of the dense glass-like scale. At
   900 degrees C, the Na2SO425 wt% NaCI molten salts can cause a serious
   damage to the composite coating which showed a big mass gain and a thick
   corroded scale after hot corrosion for 100 h.

AB The paper discusses the preparation of multicomponent thin films of
   Cu-Ti composite with desired elemental composition using the pulsed
   magnetron co-sputtering technology. The technological goal described in
   the paper was deposition the Cu-Ti composite with elemental ratio of
   about 50/50 at%, which is close to the eutectic point from the Cu-Ti
   alloy system. A large difference in the sputtering yield (about
   seven-fold) of Cu and Ti metals was challenging, because of the features
   of used power supplies. Desired concentrations of the Ti and Cu elements
   were obtained as a result of application of multimagnetron sputtering
   system, where magnetrons were equipped with the Ti or Cu targets.
   Additionally, pulse power supply was used together with the pulse width
   modulation controller. Moreover, the article presents investigations of
   structural and mechanical properties of deposited Cu, Ti and Cu-Ti films
   with elemental composition of ca. 50/50 at.%. It was found that the two
   component Cu0.5Ti0.5 thin films were composed of Cu4Ti3 nanocrystallites
   built-in an amorphous matrix. As compared to the pure Cu and Ti thin
   films, the prepared composite exhibited improved hardness and better
   elasticity reflected in lower values of the Young's modulus. The results
   of nanoindentation investigations showed that the Cu0.5Ti0.5 composite
   thin film was characterized by the hardness of 7.59 GPa.

AB The controllable alloying multiple metallic elements into an individual
   nanoparticle offers the promise material properties. Here a series of
   spherical Co-Cr-Cu-Fe-Ni nanoparticles (NPs) with an average size of
   around 80-120 nm can be easily synthesized with a controllable
   microstructure and composition by modified plasma arc-discharge method.
   The crystal structure of the as-prepared NPs is largely composed of
   Cu-rich FCC phase with a small amount of BCC phase, and the content of
   BCC phase increases with the decrease of Cu content in the NPs. The
   differences in components between the raw materials and as-prepared NPs
   are ascribed to the evaporating pressure and the molar mass of raw
   materials, and by designing the target to CoaCr3bCucFedNie, the atomic
   composition of CoaCr3bCu12cFe1.5dNie NPs can be obtained. Moreover, the
   as-prepared nanoparticles exhibit comparable soft magnetic features, and
   the asymmetric characteristic is probably due to the magnetic coupling
   of Cu-rich FCC phase with a relatively hard magnetic BCC crystalline
   phase. The case of Co-Cr-Cu-Fe-Ni NPs is a good example, which opens new
   ways to synthesize other multicomponent metal NPs with controllable
   structure and composition by controlling the molar mass of the raw
   material. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Because of the increasing complexity and cost of experiments carried
   out, the data for the multi-component alloy systems have frequently been
   obtained by numerical modelling. It is clear that the related
   calculations require reliable data dealing with the pure components and
   binary alloy systems. Selecting the reliable data concerning the pure
   components from the literature, the viscosities for the SAC and
   (SAC)(1-x) Cox solder alloys have been calculated using different
   viscosity models (geometric and physical). The viscosity decreases as
   the amount of tin content increases in the SAC387 alloy while the
   addition of the cobalt to SAC387 solder results in the increasing of the
   viscosity. Moreover, by computing the root mean square values between
   theoretical and experimental viscosities, it can be concluded that the
   lowest value among all models is that of obtained by Kaptay equation.

   solid solution alloys with a simple phase structure, strong texture,
   nanoscale grains, large microstrain and a large number of crystal
   defects. The unique microstructures coupled with extensive ion diffusion
   during the subsequent corrosion process facilitated the formation of
   ternary hydroxides with uniform and porous nanostructures. The ternary
   hydroxides composed of Ni-/Co-dominant hydrotalcite-like and Cu-dominant
   orthorhombic (Ni,Co,Cu)(OH)(2) could be efficiently prepared by
   motivating the transformation from oxide to hydroxide. The binder-free
   (Ni,Co,Cu)(OH)(2) electrode exhibited a high specific capacitance of
   1738 F g(-1) at a current density of 20 A g(-1) and decent cycling
   stability. The electrochemical/chemical growth mode, uniform porous

AB We explore the effects of the elemental site occupancy in gamma'-A3B
   (L1(2)) intermetallic phases and their partitioning across the
   gamma/gamma' interface in a class of multicomponent W-free Co-based
   superalloys. Atom probe tomography and first principles density
   functional theory calculations (DFT) were used to evaluate the Cr site
   occupancy behavior in the gamma' phase and its effect on the
   gamma/gamma' partitioning behavior of other solutes in a series of
   Co-30Ni-10Al-5Mo-2Ta-2Ti-XCr alloys, where x is 0, 2, 5, and 8 at.% Cr,
   respectively. The increase in Cr content from 0 to 2 to 5 at.% leads to
   an inversion of the partitioning behavior of the solute Mo from the
   gamma' phase (K-Mo > 1) into the gamma matrix (K-Mo < 1). At 5 at.% Cr,
   the Cr also has a preference to replace the excess anti-site Co atoms
   from the B-sites. At 8 at.% Cr, the Cr develops an additional preference
   to replace Co atoms from the A-sites. These compositional changes in the
   phases and the site partitioning behavior in the gamma' phase are
   accompanied by an overall decrease in the lattice misfit (delta) across
   the gamma/gamma' interfaces as measured by high-resolution X-ray
   diffraction at room temperature. The reduction in misfit triggers a
   change in morphology of the gamma' phase from cuboidal (delta similar to
   +0.48% at 0 at.% Cr) to round-cornered (delta similar to +0.34% at 5
   at.% Cr) to spheroidal shaped (delta similar to +0.19% at 8 at.% Cr)
   precipitates. We also observed an increase in the solvus temperature
   from 1066 degrees C to 1105 degrees C when adding 5 at.% Cr to the
   alloy. These results on the effects of Cr in Co-base superalloys enable
   tuning the microstructure of these alloys and widening the alloy
   spectrum for designing improved high temperature alloys. (C) 2018 Acta

AB The interfacial energy between the gamma and gamma ' phase in Ni-Co base
   superalloy TMW-4M3 was investigated using both a kinetic analysis of
   experimental data and a thermodynamic analysis. The coarsening rate of
   gamma' precipitates during the aging treatment process was analyzed
   using extended Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner theory, including the
   contribution of a full diffusion matrix with a thermodynamic
   calculation. The interfacial energies calculated from the coarsening
   kinetics using only the diagonal components were half as large as those
   using the off-diagonal contributions as well. The interfacial energy
   with full diffusion matrix contributions is about 75 mJ/m(2) between
   1373 and 1413 K. In addition, the interfacial energy was also analyzed
   on the basis of the extended Becker's model (EBM), and the results,
   which ranged from 73.9 to 76.3 mJ/m(2 ), showed good agreements with
   those from the coarsening kinetics. A comparison of the interfacial
   energy between TMW-4M3 and several Ni base superalloys indicated an
   identical tendency of higher interfacial energy with a larger Ti/Al
   ratio. The off-diagonal terms of a diffusion matrix are very important
   in analyzing the coarsening kinetics of gamma' and gamma/gamma' the
   interfacial energy estimation using the EBM is a suitable method for
   TMW-4M3.

AB The almost limitless variations in potential compositions of high
   entropy alloys necessitates the use of computational methods when
   attempting to optimise for any given application. However, the accuracy
   of the current thermodynamic approaches commonly being used for this
   purpose remains under debate, as relatively few validatory studies have
   been performed. Within the CrMnFeCoNi family of alloys, the formation of
   the sigma phase and how it is influenced by compositional variations is
   of particular interest for elevated temperature structural applications.
   Here, the role of Ni on the formation of the sigma phase has been
   studied through a systematic series of CrMnFeCoNix alloys, 0 <= x <=
   1.5, following 1000 h exposures at temperatures typically found to
   promote sigma formation. Ni was found to have a significant effect on
   the phase stability of these alloys, suppressing the sigma phase such
   that a single solid solution phase was the only stable phase in the
   CrMnFeCoNi1.5 alloy, whilst the CrMnFeCo alloy formed the sigma phase
   during solidification. The corresponding thermodynamic predictions
   varied dramatically from the experimentally observed microstructures,
   indicating that the underlying databases require further optimisation.
   Interestingly, it was found that a relatively simple electronic
   structure based approach, New PhaComp, provided much more accurate
   predictions of the observed sigma phase formation in the CrMnFeCoNix and
   CrMnxFeCoNi systems and could be manipulated to obtain sigma formation
   temperatures. As such, this method could be extremely useful to those
   wanting to design CrMnFeCoNi high entropy alloys that are free from the
   sigma phase. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   Cu-bearing nano-precipitated steels on compositions, tempering and
   aging, where Fe-2Cu (wt%, Cu-steel) steel by Cu-rich precipitates
   (CRPs), Fe-2Cu-5Ni-3Mn-1.5Al steel (Cu/Ni steel) by co-precipitates of
   CRPs + NiAl, and Fe-2Cu-5Ni-3Mn-1.5Al-1Mo (Mo-steel) steel by
   co-precipitates of CRPs + NiAl + Mo2C precipitates were paid special
   attentions on. The strength and ductility of Cu-steel were sensitive to
   tempering temperatures rather than aging time. Tempering and aging in
   Cu/Ni steels remarkably increased the strength with seriously
   sacrificing of ductility because larger-sized blocky CRPs segregated
   along the grain boundaries where Cu partitioning along grain boundaries
   was partially dominate, resulting in brittle fracture in almost all of
   aged Cu/Ni steels. Mo-steel, however, showed superior strength and
   ductility than Cu/Ni steel because Mo addition reduced the possibility
   of blocky CRPs by decreasing Cu partitioning along grain boundaries, and
   promoted the formation of hierarchical co-precipitates where large sized
   coarsening co-precipitates contributed to the ductility and small-sized
   secondary co-precipitates had significant strengthening, thus resulting
   in the improvement of strengthening-ductility.

AB Studies on Young's modulus and microhardness of laser fused surfaces:
   Sm-Co on the stainless steel and Sm-Fe on the duralumin substrates have
   shown the heterogeneity of depth properties with local maximum in areas
   not containing microcracks. Maximum hardening was obtained for Sm-Fe
   system. Found that hardening of laser fused layers and the increase
   their resistance to compression and tension on the stainless steel
   substrate is associated with the formation of multicomponent alloys
   (Fe17.8Ni25.6Cr5.6C11.0Sm32.1 and Fe64.3Ni1.9Cr16.6C5.5Sm8.4) due to the
   diffusion of atoms of the substrate and depends on the availability of
   the microcrack's grid of and the alloy microstructure. The high Al
   diffusion speed from duralumin substrate in the fused layer, formed from
   Sm powder, and then from Fe powder, led to the segregation of Al on the
   surface, formation of triple oxide (AlSmO3) with maximum microhardness
   and Young's modulus. Further decrease of both parameters is associated
   with the formation of microcracks, but a local maximum connects with
   strong decreasing of microcrack's density and formation of Al2Sm layer.

AB The benefits of using the pseudo-binary and pseudo-ternary diffusion
   couple methods in multicomponent inhomogeneous systems are demonstrated
   by estimating different types of composition-dependent diffusion
   coefficients. These are important for understanding the basic atomic
   mechanism of diffusion and complex compositional evolutions. These were
   otherwise considered impossible during the last many decades. Without
   any options previously, sometimes the average values over a composition
   range of random choice were estimated, which are not the material
   constants but depend on the composition range and also the end member
   compositions. The steps and analyses for utilising the pseudo-binary and
   pseudo-ternary methods are first described in the Ni-Co-Fe-Mo system by
   producing the ideal diffusion profiles fulfilling the concepts behind
   these methods. Following, the discussion is extended to the systems
   related to medium (Ni-Co-Cr) and high (Ni-Co-Fe-Mn-Al) entropy alloys.
   In fact, this is the first report showing a correct experimental method
   that should be followed for the estimation of the interdiffusion and
   intrinsic diffusion coefficients in inhomogeneous high entropy alloys.
   In the end, the limitations of following these methods because of the
   generation of non-ideal diffusion profiles are discussed based on
   experimental results. The steps are also suggested to avoid such
   complications. These methods are easy to adopt for research engineers.
   Most importantly, these give an opportunity to validate the data
   estimated following newly proposed numerical methods by different groups
   with experimentally estimated diffusion coefficients, which were not
   possible earlier.

AB The aim of the task has been the development of technology of the
   complex modification of Ni-Cr-Al-Ti-Mo-W-Co multicomponent alloys by
   dispersible compositions. A nanodispersed modifier titanium
   carbonitrides Ti(C, N) served as a basis of a modifier. Nanopowders of a
   modifier were obtained on the facility of plasma-chemical synthesis. The
   scientific novelty of the work is to establish the mechanism of modifier
   action in the fusion. The optimum amount of modifier input was
   determined experimentally. The temperature-temporal options of
   modification were tested. Regularities of modification effect of
   titanium carbide dispersible refractory composition on improving complex
   properties of multicomponent nickel alloy were defined. The results
   obtained were used at the machine-building enterprise to increase the
   mechanical and operational properties of heatproof alloys for gas
   turbine engine blades. As a result of research on the modification of
   multicomponent nickel alloys ZS3DK, ZS6U for gas turbine engine blades
   it was defined that the introduction of complex modifier on the basis of
   nanopowder of titanium carbonitride into the fusion leads to the
   substantial modification of alloy structure. Nanoparticles of titanium
   carbonitride are the additional centers of crystallization. Formation at
   the modification of the fine-grained structure and strengthened solid
   solution leads to the improvement of mechanical and exploitation
   properties of the alloy, that has an important practical value. The
   considerable increase in strength and plastic properties was attained.
   Corresponding parameters' augmentations are by 10 % in sigma(V) 13 % in
   sigma(T) 10.30 % in delta, and 44 % in KCU. The longevity of alloy
   increased by 30 % depending on the tension of tests. After tests on
   heat-tolerance, the depth of corrosion in the modified alloys is
   diminished by 25 % on average that confirms the effect of the
   modification.

   300 K. At elevated temperatures (400 K to 880 K), the alloy powders
   maintained the gamma-phase up to 640 K, thereafter it was comprised of

   area of solid solution, existed at Fe-Ni-Co-(Cu, Cr) system. It is
   well-known, that alloys of this system are the new type of materials,
   characterized by high entropy of mixing. Design of high entropy alloys
   (HEAs) with desired properties is modern trend in materials science
   nowadays, and number of articles, related to the discussed topic, is
   constantly increasing. Authors of the current work came down to the
   design and analysis of HEAs from the thermodynamic point of view, based
   on the own experience in experimental investigation of phase diagrams of
   multicomponent metallic systems Research is provided with the use of
   classical physicoE chemical methods of phase diagram construction,
   namely, differential thermal analysis, electron probe microanalysis,
   X-ray diffraction analysis and scanning electron microscopy. During the
   first step of research the liquidus and solidus surface projections of
   the Fe-Ni- Co-Cu quaternary system have been constructed. There were
   defined the limits of solidstate miscibility gap and tieElines location
   within the discussed miscibility gap. In such a way we defined the area
   of quaternary solid solution, within the volume of that the HEAs can be
   synthesized. The next step of research is determination of temperature
   and composition areas of solid solution in Fe-Ni-Co-(Cu, Cr) system. The
   effect of addition of Cu and Cr on the structure, phase composition and
   properties of obtained alloys has been shown. ObE tained information
   could be useful as basis for design of HEAs.

AB Heterogeneous catalysts are workhorses in the industrial production of
   most commodity and specialty chemicals, and have widespread energy and
   environmental applications, with the annual market value of the
   catalysts themselves reaching almost $20 billion in 2018. These
   catalysts are complex, comprising multi-component materials and multiple
   structures, making their rational design challenging, if not impossible.
   Furthermore, typical active metals like Pt, Pd, and Rh are expensive and
   can be susceptible to poisoning by CO, coking, and they are not always
   100% selective. Efforts to use these elements sparingly and improve
   their selectivity has led to recent identification of single-atom
   heterogeneous catalysts in which individual transition metal atoms
   anchored on oxide or carbon-based supports are excellent catalysts for
   reactions like the CO oxidation, water-gas shift, alcohol
   dehydrogenation, and steam reforming.
   In this Account, we describe a new class of single-atom heterogeneous
   catalysts, namely, Single-Atom Alloys (SAAs) that comprise catalytically
   active elements like Pt, Pd, and Ni alloyed in more inert host metals at
   the single-atom limit. These materials evolved by complementary surface
   science and scanning probe studies using single crystals, and catalytic
   evaluation of the corresponding alloy nanoparticles with compositions
   informed by the surface science findings. The well-defined nature of the
   active sites in SAAs makes accurate modeling with theory relatively
   easy, enabling the rational design of SAA catalysts via a complementary
   three-prong approach, encompassing surface science model catalysts,
   theory, and real catalyst synthesis and testing under industrially
   relevant conditions. SAAs constitute one of just a few examples of when
   heterogeneous catalyst design has been guided by an understanding of
   fundamental surface processes.
   The Account starts by describing scanning tunneling microscopy studies
   of highly dilute alloys formed by doping small amounts of a
   catalytically active element into a more inert host metal. We first
   discuss hydrogenation reactions in which dissociation of H-2 is often
   rate limiting. Results indicate how the SAA geometry allows the
   transition state and the binding site of the reaction intermediates to
   be decoupled, which enables both facile dissociation of reactants and
   weak binding of intermediates, two key factors for efficient and
   selective catalysis. These results were exploited to design the first
   PtCu SAA hydrogenation catalysts which showed high selectivity,
   stability and resistance to poisoning in industrially relevant
   hydrogenation reactions, such as the selective conversion of butadiene
   to butenes.
   Model studies also revealed spillover of hydrogen atoms from the Pt site
   where dissociation of H-2 occurs to Cu sites where selective
   hydrogenation is facilitated in a bifunctional manner. We then discuss
   selective dehydrogenations on SAAs demonstrating that they enable
   efficient C-H activation, while being resistant to coking that plagues
   typical Pt catalysts. SAA PtCu nanoparticle catalysts showed excellent
   stability in butane dehydrogenation for days-on-stream at 400 degrees C.
   Another advantage of SAA catalysts is that on many alloy combinations
   CO, a common catalyst poison, binds more weakly to the alloy than the
   pure metal. We conclude by discussing recent theory results that predict
   the energetics of many key reaction steps on a wide range of SAAs and
   the exciting possibilities this reductionist approach to heterogeneous
   catalysis offers for the rational design of new catalysts.

AB Nanostructure engineering is important in the development of metal-based
   catalysts to improve material utilization efficiency and catalytic
   activity. Among the available nanoscale architectures, mesoporous
   structures have raised much attention due to their large surface area
   and their highly accessible inner sites for guest species, suitable for
   a wide range of applications. Gold (Au)-based materials are promising
   catalysts thanks to their stability, nontoxicity, and good resistance to
   poisoning effects. Modifying the composition by introducing inexpensive
   metals to prepare multicomponent Au-based catalysts is an effective
   route to both reduce the cost and improve the catalytic activity.
   Herein, a polymeric micelle assembly approach to synthesize mesoporous
   AuCuNi ternary alloy films by electrochemical deposition is reported.
   This simple method involves the co-electrodeposition process of Au, Cu,
   and Ni precursors at fixed applied potential in the presence of
   polymeric micelles acting as a sacrificial template. The compositional
   ratio can be easily adjusted to optimize the catalytic performance of
   the mesoporous AuCuNi films, which show promising results for glucose
   oxidation and methanol oxidation reactions. It is believed that
   mesoporous AuCuNi films can be desirable to satisfy the needs for the
   next generation of multifunctional catalyst.

AB In an attempt to identify new low-cost metallic materials with
   interesting thermo-physical properties from the Fe-Cr-Mn-Ni-V-Ti-Al-
   (Co-Mo) system, we present here an original tool for the design of
   first-generation High Entropy Alloys (HEAs). The composition of
   potential HEAs is calculated under a set of non-smooth and non-linear
   constraints and multi-objective functions linked to the single-phase
   start temperature, the room-temperature driving force for phase
   assemblage evolution and the solidification range. These are all new
   thermodynamic criteria for the design of HEM. This tool links a
   constrained Gibbs energy minimization algorithm that uses accurate
   thermodynamic databases to an optimization algorithm implemented for
   solving "blackbox" objective functions and constraints. As a result of
   this work, we have identified entire sets of new FCC and BCC
   first-generation HEAs potentially suitable for future industrial
   applications. The proposed methodology is also successfully applied to
   identify two-phase heavily alloyed materials. (C) 2018 Acta Materialia

   (BEDFs) in a temperature range of from room temperature (RT) up to 1100
   degrees C are clarified by PL, Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)
   and X-ray Diffraction (XRD) measurements. When pumped by an 830 nm laser
   diode, the fiber exhibits a broad near-infrared (NIR) emission band
   consisting of three distinctive peaks at the wavelengths of 1100, 1420
   and 1530 nm, originating from different luminescence centers, viz.,
   Al-related, Si-related bismuth active centers (BACs) and Er3+,
   respectively. The relative emission intensities of the BACs and Er3+
   vary in distinctively different manners with thermal treatment
   temperature are comprehensively studied. Three temperature regions,
   i.e., RT similar to 300 degrees C, 300-800 degrees C, and 800-1100
   degrees C can be distinguished accordingly. The instability of the BACs,
   formation of non-luminous bismuth centers and crystallization of the
   fiber are proposed to account for the thermal effects on the PL
   behaviors of the different luminescent centers in the fiber. A

AB Cemented carbides with Ni-Co-Cr-Al-W binder phases have been obtained
   from WC-Ni-Co-Cr3C2-TiAl3 powder mixtures by using standard hardmetal
   processing routes. Dilatometric and DSC experiments confirm that melting
   events and shrinkage in these materials are shifted towards higher
   temperatures as the Al content increases. It is also shown that
   sintering in Argon is enhanced at very low Al levels (0.63 wt%), which
   is likely due to the efficient reduction of powder oxides via direct
   reaction with TiAl3. For higher Al additions, HIP treatments are needed
   in order to remove the residual porosity left after vacuum sintering.
   Microstructural characterization confirms that Al additions induce two
   types of precipitation phenomena in the metallic binder phase of these
   hardmetals: one consisting of very fine Al-rich oxides (product of the
   aforementioned powder oxide reduction) and the other comprising even
   finer gamma' type cuboids (similar to those found in Ni superalloys). As
   confirmed by TEM-EDS analyses, the binder phase of these cemented
   carbides is a multicomponent alloy incluiding Co, Ni, Cr, W and
   increasing amounts of Al as TiAl3 addition increases. About 0.5 wt% Al
   is lost to the powder oxides reduction process. TiAl3 additions have a
   significant hardening effect on WC-Ni-Co-Cr3C2 alloys. This is due to
   its effective role as WC grain growth inhibitor. Although,
   solution-aging treatments induce a finer and more homogeneous
   precipitation of the gamma' phase in these materials, their hardness is
   slighlty reduced if compared to that of as-HIPed samples.

AB Although great advances have been achieved in the field of fuel cells,
   the lack of cost-efficient electrocatalysts is still the grand challenge
   impeding the practical application of fuel cells. To this end, rational
   design of efficient multicomponent electrocatalysts with both high
   activity and stability is highly momentous for fuel cell reaction.
   Herein, a facile approach to controllably engineer trimetallic hexagonal
   PtCuCo nanocrystals (NCs) as highly active and durable liquid fuel
   electrooxidation catalysts is reported. Impressively, after the
   incorporation of Cu and Co into Pt, the electronic structures of Pt
   remarkably modified, leading to the enhancement of electrocatalytic
   performances. The optimized hexagonal PtCuCo NCs were demonstrated to
   display outstanding activities of 4926.4 and 3519.9 mA mg(-1) for the
   electrooxidation of ethylene glycol (EG) and glycerol, in comparison
   with Pt/C catalysts. The greatly improved activity of hexagonal PtCuCo
   NCs is ascribed to the highly exposed surface active areas and the
   electronic effects among Pt, Cu, and Co. More importantly, the
   trimetallic hexagonal nanocatalysts also display great durability with
   little variations in composition, structure, and activity, showing an
   advanced class of nanocatalysts for fuel cells and beyond. (C) 2018

AB Alloying nanoparticle is a method to adjust the surface properties of

   usually exhibit outstanding characteristics which are disparate from
   monometallic nanoparticles. In this regard, a bimetallic catalyst based
   on sliver and cobalt nanoparticles incorporated in the structure of
   hierarchical ZSM-5 (Hi-ZSM-5) was produced. This novel catalyst was
   simply produced through simultaneous chemical reduction of silver and
   cobalt ions in the presence of Hi-ZSM-5. The solid support (Hi-ZSM-5)
   has played a highly crucial part in this catalyst because it offers a
   high surface area for deposition of nanoparticles as active sites and
   facilitates diffusion of reactants by its mesopores. The catalytic
   aspects of Ag-Co/Hi-ZSM-5 were examined in A(3) coupling reaction of
   amine, aldehyde, acetylene in water media and impacts of different
   reaction parameters were extensively investigated. Outperforming both
   monometallic counterparts, the catalyst was found highly selective,
   stable and recoverable in the reaction and it did not show any sign of
   chemical or morphological alterations after 5 runs. The chemical
   composition and morphological properties of the catalyst were evaluated
   by XRD, BET, SEM-EDS, TEM, DRS-UV and ICP-AES techniques.

   structure. This structure stabilizes Pd and promotes its catalytic
   performance toward a model reaction, formic acid oxidation.
   Computational modeling suggests that the triple junction structure is
   the most stable configuration that provides desired anchoring sites for
   Pd and enables a favorable synergy between the multicomponents Pd, Sn,
   SnOx, and TiC for high activity. The triple junction structure also can
   provide better stability against catalysts migration, detachment, or
   sintering. Experimental measurements also confirm that multicomponent
   catalysts provide synergistic functions. The intermediate products,
   COads, prefer to adsorb onto the Pd sites, while the OH prefers the Sn

AB The present investigation reports the effect of aluminum addition on the
   microstructural evolution in the equiatomic CoCrFeMnNi high-entropy
   alloy. Aluminum was added to the alloy in varying quantity (0Al10at.%)
   using the vacuum arc melting technique, and phase formation was probed
   using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and transmission
   electron microscopy. The results indicate that the FCC phase in the
   alloy remains unaltered up to Al of 5at.%. The higher amount of Al
   addition leads to the precipitation of B2 Al(Ni, Cr, Fe, Co, Mn) in the
   FCC matrix. For Al7%, typical phase-separated microstructure consisting
   of FCC, and B2 phases have been observed. The microstructural changes
   lead to hardness variation from 1.3 to 2.2GPa, mainly due to
   precipitation and solute solution hardening of FCC phase. For FCC phase,
   Al atoms being larger in size can lead to lattice distortion and improve
   yield strength. The results have been explained by detailed
   thermodynamic analysis using HEA3 database.

   The complete X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy coupled
   with energy dispersive spectroscopy analyses are carried out to
   recognize the phases in addition to understand the series of phase
   development in the presently studied HEAs. For Co-Fe-Mn-Ni-Ti HEAs, at
   first BCC () phase primary dendritic phase is created from the liquid,
   followed by peritectic reaction to form FCC () phase (i.e. BCC ()+LFCC
   ()). Then the left over liquid undergoes eutectic reaction to form FCC
   () and Ti-2(Ni, Co) phases (i.e. LFCC ()+Ti-2(Ni, Co)). Furthermore, the
   pseudo quasi-peritectic reactions i.e. L+BCC ()FCC () +Ti-2(Ni, Co) has
   been proposed based on the microstructure evolution study in case of
   Co-Fe-Mn-Ni-Ti HEAs. It is important to note that Co-Fe-Mn-Ni-Ti HEAs
   show eutectics between FCC () and Ti-2(Ni, Co) phases. The
   multicomponent Co25Fe25Mn5Ni25Ti20 eutectic HEA shows the retention of
   high strength at elevated temperature.

AB The effect of V addition to the Fe-Ni-Co-Cu system was analyzed in the
   present work. Three distinct alloys were prepared in a vacuum electric
   arc furnace in an argon atmosphere and later cast into a copper mold.
   Investigation of the structure of alloys was performed by scanning
   electron microscopy (SEM) and by X-ray diffraction. The mechanical
   properties were also tested in compression. The phase diagrams of the
   Fe-Ni-Co-Cu-V system were thermodynamically calculated and the results
   are compared with those of differential scanning calorimetry and the
   results of SEM observation. It is shown that as a result of
   crystallization, two solid solutions with FCC crystal structures are
   formed. The addition of equiatomic amount of vanadium to Fe-Ni-Co-Cu
   system alloys facilitates phase separation in the liquid state. The
   addition of V causes an increase in the yield strength by solid solution
   hardening by about 30 pct and maximum true stress by 40 pct, yet
   retaining good plasticity. It also does not cause formation of an
   intermetallic compound. (C) The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society and

AB The single-crystal X-ray structure of a 6-component organic-salt alloy
   (hexanary) of naftopidil (1) (an active pharmaceutical ingredient) with
   benzoic acid (2) and four different hydroxy-substituted benzoic acids,
   i.e. salicylic acid (3), 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid (4),
   2,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid (5) and 2,6-dihydroxybenzoic acid (6), is
   reported. The hexanary assembly originates from the observation that the
   binary salts of naftopidil with the above acids are isostructural. In
   addition to the 6-component solid, we also describe five 5-component,
   ten 4-component, and ten 3-component organic-salt alloys of naftopidil
   (1) with carboxylic acids (2)-(6). These alloys were obtained from
   different combinations of the acids with the drug. The synthetic design
   of the multicomponent organic alloys is based on the rationale of
   geometrical factors (shape and size) and chemical interactions (hydrogen
   bonds). The common supramolecular synthon in all these crystal
   structures was the cyclic N+ - H center dot center dot center dot O- and
   O-H center dot center dot center dot O hydrogen-bonded motif of R-2(2)
   (9) graph set between the 2-hydroxyammonium group of naftopidil and the
   carboxylate anion. This ionic synthon is strong and robust, directing
   the isostructural assembly of naftopidil with up to five different
   carboxylic acids in the crystal structure together with the lower-level
   multicomponent adducts. Solution crystallization by slow evaporation
   provided the multicomponent organic salts and alloys which were
   characterized by a combination of single-crystal X-ray diffraction,
   powder X-ray diffraction, NMR and differential scanning calorimetry
   techniques.

AB It has been 14 years since the discovery of the high-entropy alloys
   (HEAs), an idea of alloying which has reinvigorated materials scientists
   to explore unconventional alloy compositions and multicomponent alloy
   systems. Many authors have referred to these alloys as multi-principal
   element alloys (MPEAs) or complex concentrated alloys (CCAs) in order to
   place less restrictions on what constitutes an HEA. Regardless of
   classification, the research is rooted in the exploration of
   structure-properties and processing relations in these multicomponent
   alloys with the aim to surpass the physical properties of conventional
   materials. More recent studies show that some of these alloys undergo
   liquid phase separation, a phenomenon largely dictated by low entropy of
   mixing and positive mixing enthalpy. Studies posit that positive mixing
   enthalpy of the binary and ternary components contribute substantially
   to the formation of liquid miscibility gaps. The objective of this
   review is to bring forth and summarize the findings of the experiments
   which detail liquid phase separation (LPS) in HEAs, MPEAs, and CCAs and
   to draw parallels between HEAs and the conventional alloy systems which
   undergo liquid-liquid separation. Positive mixing enthalpy if not
   compensated by the entropy of mixing will lead to liquid phase
   separation. It appears that Co, Ni, and Ti promote miscibility in
   HEAs/CCAs/MPEAs while Cr, V, and Nb will raise the miscibility gap
   temperature and increase LPS. Moreover, addition of appropriate amounts
   of Ni to CoCrCu eliminates immiscibility, such as in cases of
   dendritically solidifying CoCrCuNi, CoCrCuFeNi, and CoCrCuMnNi.

AB The structural hierarchy exhibited by materials on more than one length
   scale can play a major part in determining bulk material properties.
   Understanding the hierarchical structure can lead to new materials with
   physical properties tailored for specific applications. We have used a
   combined experimental and phase-field modeling approach to explore such
   a hierarchical structure at nanoscale for enhanced coarsening resistance
   of ordered gamma' precipitates in an experimental, multicomponent,
   high-refractory nickel-base superalloy. The hierarchical microstructure
   formed experimentally in this alloy is composed of a gamma matrix with
   gamma' precipitates that contain embedded, spherical gamma precipitates,
   which do not directionally coarsen during high-temperature annealing but
   do delay coarsening of the larger gamma' precipitates. Chemical mapping
   via atom probe tomography suggests that the supersaturation of Co, Ru,
   and Re in they' phase is the driving force for the phase separation,
   leading to the formation of this hierarchical microstructure.
   Representative phase-field modeling highlights the importance of larger
   gamma' precipitates to promote stability of the embedded gamma phase and
   to delay coarsening of the encompassing gamma' precipitates. Our results
   suggest that the hierarchical material design has the potential to
   influence the high-temperature stability of precipitate strengthened
   metallic materials.

AB An approach previously developed for the calculation of transport
   coefficients via the Mott relations is applied to the calculation of
   finite temperature transport properties of disordered alloys-electrical
   resistivity and the electronic part of thermal conductivity. The
   coherent-potential approximation is used to treat chemical disorder as
   well as other sources of electron scattering, i.e., temperature induced
   magnetic moment fluctuations and lattice vibrations via the alloy
   analogy model. This approach, which treats all forms of disorder on an
   equal first-principles footing, is applied to the calculation of
   transport properties of a series of fcc concentrated solid solutions of
   the 3d-transition metals Ni, Fe, Co, and Cr. For the nonmagnetic alloys
   Ni0.8Cr0.2 and Ni0.33Co0.33Cr0.3, the combined effects of chemical
   disorder and electron-lattice vibrations scattering result in a
   monotonic increase in the resistivity as a function of temperature from
   an already large, T = 0, residual resistivity. For magnetic Ni0.5Co0.5,
   Ni0.5Fe0.5, and Ni0.33Fe0.33Co0.33, the residual resistivity of which is
   small, additional electron scattering from temperature induced magnetic
   moment fluctuations results in a further rapid increase of the
   resistivity as a function of temperature. The electronic part of the
   thermal conductivity in nonmagnetic Ni0.8Cr0.2 and Ni0.33Co0.33Cr0.33
   monotonically increases with temperature. This behavior is a result of
   the competition between a reduction in the conductivity due to
   electron-lattice vibrations scattering and temperature induced increase
   in the number of carriers. In the magnetic alloys, electron scattering
   from magnetic fluctuations leads to an initial rapid decrease in thermal
   conductivity until this is overcome by an increasing number of carriers
   at temperatures slightly below the Curie temperature. Similar to the
   resistivity above T-C, the electronic parts of the thermal
   conductivities are close to each other in all alloys studied.

AB The electroplating of copper by the damascene process is the
   predominantly used technique for on-chip wiring in the fabrication of
   ultra-large scale integrated microchips. In this process, void-free
   superconformal filling of trenches is achieved by multicomponent
   electrolytes, containing chloride and organic additives in addition to
   the Cu ions. In this paper we review studies of the atomic-scale Cu
   interface structure and homoepitaxial Cu electrodeposition behavior in
   acidic (pH 1-3) Cl-containing electrolyte by in-situ surface X-ray
   diffraction. This technique provides detailed insight on the 3D atomic
   arrangement at the electrode surface and fast time-resolved data on the
   kinetic growth mode. On Cu(111) a complex potential-dependent adlayer
   structure is found, involving transitions between a chemisorbed oxygen
   species to a hexagonal close-packed incommensurate chloride adlayer. In
   contrast, on Cu(001) a simple disorder-order transition to a c(2 x 2) Cl
   adlayer is found. Parallel to the latter, a crossover from step-flow to
   layer-by-layer and finally 3D growth occurs during Cu(001)
   electrodeposition, indicating a decreasing Cu surface mobility toward
   more positive potentials. The presence of the organic additive
   polyethylene glycol (PEG) stabilizes the partial c(2 x 2) Cl adlayer on
   the Cu(001) surface and leads to an inhibition of Cu deposition with a
   tendency to rougher growth. (C) The Author(s) 2018. Published by ECS.

AB High entropy alloys are multicomponent alloys, which consist of five or
   more elements in equiatomic or nearly equiatomic concentrations. These
   materials are hypothesized to show significantly decreased
   self-diffusivities. For the first time, diffusion of all constituent
   elements in equiatomic CoCrFeNi and CoCrFeMnNi single crystals and
   additionally solute diffusion of Mn in the quaternary alloy is
   investigated using the radiotracer technique, thereby the tracer
   diffusion coefficients of Co-57, Cr-51, Fe-59, Mn-54, and Ni-63 are
   determined at a temperature of 1373 K. The components are characterized
   by significantly different diffusion rates, with Mn being the fastest
   element and Ni and Co being the slowest ones. Furthermore, solute
   diffusion of Cu in the CoCrFeNi single crystal is investigated in the
   temperature range of 973-1173 K using the Cu-64 isotope. In the
   quaternary alloy, Cu is found to be a fast diffuser at the moderate
   temperatures below 1273 K and its diffusion rate follows the Arrhenius
   law with an activation enthalpy of about 149 kJ/mol.

   multicomponent hardmetal scraps. The isothermal oxidation behavior of
   WC-Co multicomponent cemented carbide inserts with a TiCN/Al2O3/TiN hard
   coating in the recycling process was investigated. The oxidation rate
   slowed down as the protective coating blocked element diffusion. A rapid
   oxidation rate was obtained when they were milled into powders and
   isothermally oxidized at 900 degrees C. A rapid path for element
   diffusion was provided by the defects, which were promoted by stress,
   expansion, and gas volatilization. Both the TiN and TiCN layers were
   oxidized to a porous TiO2 scale, while the Al2O3 phase remained and the
   dense Al2O3 layer acted as a barrier for its good oxidation resistance.
   Pieces of the Al2O3 layer were obviously seen in the final oxides. This
   provides critical information to reduce the negative effect of coatings
   and improve the performance of recycled WC powders and hard alloys.

AB Components in energy-producing systems suffer a variety of degradation
   processes such as oxidation and molten salt-induced corrosion as a
   consequence of complex multi-component gaseous environment. Coatings
   provide a composition that will grow the protective scale at high
   temperatures having long-term stability. Plasma spraying was used to
   deposit CoCrAlY + WC-Co composite coatings on turbine alloys of
   Hastelloy X and AISI 321. The thermocyclic oxidation behavior of coated
   alloys was investigated in static air and in molten salt
   (Na2SO4-60%V2O5) environment at 700 degrees C. The thermogravimetric
   technique was used to approximate the kinetics of oxidation in 50
   cycles, each cycle consisting of heating and cooling. X-ray diffraction
   and SEM/EDAX techniques are used to characterize the oxide scale formed.
   Coated alloys showed a lower corrosion rate as compared to uncoated
   alloys. The coatings subjected to oxidation and hot corrosion showed
   slow scale growth kinetics. Preferential oxidation of Co, Cr, W and its
   spinel blocks the transport of oxygen and corrosive species into the
   coating by providing a barrier, thereby making the oxidation rate to
   reach steady state. As compared to the substrate alloys, coatings show
   better hot corrosion resistance.

AB Based on 18 bulk diffusion couples, the composition-dependent
   interdiffusion coefficients in the fcc Co-V-Mo alloys at 1273, 1373 and
   1473 K were obtained from the intersection points of the diffusion
   couples by means of EPMA technique coupled with the Whittle and Green
   method. With the experimentally determined interdiffusion coefficients
   and the critically reviewed experimental diffusivities available in the
   literature, the atomic mobilities of fcc Co-V-Mo alloys were assessed by
   means of Diffusion Controlled Transformation (DICTRA) software. The
   quality of the assessed atomic mobilities was confirmed by the
   comprehensive comparisons between various DICTRA-calculated diffusion
   behaviors and the experimental ones, including concentration profiles
   and diffusion paths.

AB Interdiffusion in the BCC phase of the Ti-Mn binary and Ti-Al-Mn ternary
   systems was investigated between 1273 and 1473 K by applying the
   diffusion-couple technique. The local chemical compositions within the
   interdiffusion zone of the diffusion couples were acquired by electron
   probe microanalysis (EPMA). The raw composition profiles were then
   analytically represented by the error function expansion, which allow
   the ternary inter- and impurity diffusivities to be appropriately
   extracted by the Whittle-Green and generalized Hall methods,
   respectively. It was demonstrated that, all four diffusion coefficients
   (D) over tilde (k)(ij) (i, j = Al, Mn), both main and cross ones,
   increase with increasing the composition of diffusing specie at 1473 K,
   whereas at 1273 K (D) over tilde (Ti)(MnMn) and (D) over tilde
   (Ti)(MnAl) are enhanced by the addition of diffusing specie Mn but (D)
   over tilde (Ti)(AlAl) and (D) over tilde (Ti)(AlMn) are in weak
   dependence with the Al content. A complete comparison among seven
   Ti-Al-X (Ni, Co, Fe, Mn, Cr, V and Mo) ternary systems reveals that the
   order of the average main interdiffusion coefficients <(<(D)over
   tilde>(Ti)(XX))over bar> (X = Ni, Co, Fe, Mn, Cr, V and Mo) exhibits
   D-Ni > D-Co > D-Fe > D-Mn > D-Cr > D-V > D-Mo.

AB Industrial processes for the production of metals and alloys by
   metallurgical and electrochemical methods generate a great deal of waste
   heat due to irreversible losses. This waste heat may be used as a power
   source to generate electricity. A thermocell with noncritical and
   inexpensive molten carbonate based electrolyte mixtures with reversible
   (CO(2)1O(2)) gas electrodes was reported recently. It demonstrates the
   possibility of utilizing the waste heat (>550 degrees C) as a power
   source. A thermocell is an electrochemical cell with two identical
   electrodes placed in an ionic conducting electrolyte solution with a
   temperature gradient between the electrodes. The heat source will be
   used to create the temperature gradient between the electrodes, which
   will lead to a potential difference by executing ionic diffusion in the
   electrolyte. In this work, the thermophysical and chemical properties of
   the electrolyte mixture were tuned by multicomponent mixing with molten
   (K and Ca) carbonate and LiF additives into the binary (Li,Na) carbonate
   mixture. It reduces the liquidus temperature to -400 degrees C and
   enables the molten carbonate thermocells to recover the high-grade waste
   heat available at even low temperatures well below 550 degrees C. Still,
   the Seebeck coefficient of the thermocells remains large (in the range
   of-1.5 mV/K).

AB The recent observation of the hexagonal-closed-packed (hcp) phase in
   CoCrFeNi-based multicomponent alloys has reopened the question of phase
   stability in these alloys. We investigate the alloying effect of
   tungsten on the crystal and magnetic structures of (CoCrFeNi)(1-x)W-x
   high entropy alloys using density functional theory by means of the
   exact muffin-tin orbital method. The body-centered-cubic (bcc),
   face-centered-cubic (fcc), and hcp phases are investigated in two
   magnetic states: ferrimagnetic and paramagnetic. Below 8 at. % W the
   ground state of (CoCrFeNi)(1-x)W-x is the ferrimagnetic hcp phase and
   above that, the ferrimagnetic bcc phase is stabilized. Our calculations
   show that the fcc and hcp phases are energetically very close in the
   whole range of studied W compositions and because CoCrFeNi and
   (CoCrFeNi)(0.93)W-0.07 are observed in the fcc phase at room
   temperature, the hcp-fcc structural phase transition is expected to
   occur at lower temperatures. The total magnetic moment in bcc is almost
   double the value calculated for the fcc and hcp structures, which is due
   to that Cr moments are nearly quenched in bcc but are coupled
   antiferromagnetically to Fe, Ni, and Co in both hcp and fcc. We
   calculated also the Curie temperature of these alloys using the
   mean-field approximation. The calculated value was found to be 155 K for
   fcc CoCrFeNi, in excellent agreement with experiments, and the addition
   of W decreases this value. Our results contribute to the development of
   these relatively unknown corrosion-resistant materials into industrial
   applications, such as cemented carbides.

AB The coating is one of the biggest problems in the recycling of coated
   multicomponent hardmetal scraps. The isothermal oxidation behavior of
   WC-Co multicomponent cemented carbide inserts with a TiCN/Al₂O₃/TiN hard
   coating in the recycling process was investigated. The oxidation rate
   slowed down as the protective coating blocked element diffusion. A rapid
   oxidation rate was obtained when they were milled into powders and
   isothermally oxidized at 900 °C. A rapid path for element diffusion was
   provided by the defects, which were promoted by stress, expansion, and
   gas volatilization. Both the TiN and TiCN layers were oxidized to a
   porous TiO₂ scale, while the Al₂O₃ phase remained and the dense Al₂O₃
   layer acted as a barrier for its good oxidation resistance. Pieces of
   the Al₂O₃ layer were obviously seen in the final oxides. This provides
   critical information to reduce the negative effect of coatings and
   improve the performance of recycled WC powders and hard alloys.

AB A popular area of research in the field of high-temperature alloys
   concerns the search of substitutional elements for Re in order to
   manufacture single-crystal Ni-based superalloys with less or even no Re
   addition. To find the elements with similar or even lower diffusion
   coefficients than Re is an effective strategy. Based on 29 fcc diffusion
   couples in ternary Ni-Al-X (X = Re, Os, and Ir) systems, high-throughput
   measurement of composition- and temperature-dependent interdiffusivity
   matrices was performed using our recently developed numerical inverse
   method implemented in HitDIC software. The reliability of the determined
   interdiffusivities was validated by comprehensively comparing the
   model-predicted composition/interdiffusion flux profiles for each
   diffusion couple with the corresponding experimental data. Moreover, we
   also conducted a comparison with the interdiffusivities evaluated using
   the traditional Matano-Kirkaldy method as well as those from the
   literature and in boundary binary systems. After that, a comprehensive
   comparison of the interdiffusion coefficients in fcc Ni-2 wt pct Al-6 wt
   pct X (X = Ti, Co, Ni, Nb, Mo, Ru, Rh, Ta, W, Re, Os, Ir, and Pt) alloys
   at 1423 K to 1573 K was conducted. Results indicate that the diffusion
   rate of Re is lower than that of Os at 1473 K and 1523 K; but higher at
   1573 K, while the diffusion rate of Ir is always slightly higher than
   those of Os and Re at 1473 K to 1573 K. Further analysis of the
   magnitude of the interdiffusion coefficient correlates with the alloying
   concentration, activation energy, atomic number, and atomic radius of
   different diffusing transition metal species (i.e., Ti, Co, Ni, Nb, Mo,
   Ru, Rh, Ta, W, Re, Os, Ir, and Pt) was conducted, which is expected to
   provide useful information regarding element choice in the development
   of new-generation Ni-based single-crystal superalloys.

AB The nano-hardness in the alternative Ni-85-Fe-15 binder phase of WC
   cemented carbide has been investigated. High-resolution scanning
   electron microscopy (SEM) imaging was used to measure the projected
   indentation area and a general pile-up correction, confirmed on selected
   indents, has been employed using atomic force microscopy (AFM). Focused
   ion-beam (FIB) cross-sections have been used to investigate the binder
   morphology below the indentations and the local binder hardness has been
   associated to the distance to the surrounding WC grains. Generally,
   decreasing distance to the WC grains leads to increased binder hardness.
   Furthermore, the nano-hardness for the cemented carbide binder has been
   corrected for the indentation size effect (ISE) to obtain the
   corresponding macroscopic hardness. A solid solution strengthening model
   for multicomponent bulk alloys was used to calculate the expected binder
   Vickers hardness considering the binder solubilities of W and C. Both
   the strengthening model and the ISE corrected hardness values, for
   larger binder regions, are in good agreement indicating that the
   intrinsic binder phase hardness is similar to that of a bulk metal alloy
   with similar composition.

AB Nanoparticles comprising three or more different metals are challenging
   to prepare. General methods that tackle this challenge are highly sought
   after as multicomponent metal nanoparticles display favorable properties
   in applications such as catalysis, biomedicine, and imaging. Herein, we
   report a practical and versatile approach for the synthesis of
   nanoparticles composed of up to four different metals. This method
   relies on the thermal decomposition of nanostructured composite
   materials assembled from platinum nanoparticles, a metal organic
   framework (ZIF-8), and a tannic acid coordination polymer. The
   controlled integration of multiple metal cations (Ni, Co, Cu, Mn, Fe,
   and/or Tb) into the tannic acid shell of the precursor material dictates
   the composition of the final multicomponent metal nanoparticles. Upon
   thermolysis, the platinum nanoparticles seed the growth of the
   multicomponent metal nanoparticles via coalescence with the metallic
   constituents of the tannic acid coordination polymer. The nanoparticles
   are supported in the walls of hollow nitrogen-doped porous carbon
   capsules created by the decomposition of the organic components of the
   precursor. The capsules prevent sintering and detachment of the
   nanoparticles, and their porosity allows for efficient mass transport.
   To demonstrate the utility of producing a broad library of supported
   multicomponent metal nanoparticles, we tested their electrocatalytic
   performance toward the hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution
   reaction. We discovered functional relationships between the composition
   of the nanoparticles and their electrochemical activity and identified
   the PtNiCu and PtNiCuFe nanoparticles as particularly efficient
   catalysts. This highlights how to generate diverse libraries of
   multicomponent metal nanoparticles that can be synthesized and
   subsequently screened to identify high-performance materials for target
   applications.

AB Secondary phases precipitated in diffusion affected zones (DAZs) of a
   transient liquid phase (Tip) bonded Ni-based superalloy have a large
   impact on materials properties. Here we report an atomic-scale analysis
   of the crystal structures and elemental distributions within DAZ
   precipitates in a TLP-bonded single-crystal superalloy using a range of
   electron microscopy techniques. The predominant precipitate phases are
   found to be M3B2- and M5B3-type borides, where M is a mixture of
   transition metal elements. Atomically-resolved energy-dispersive X-ray
   spectroscopy in an aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron
   microscope (STEM) enabled the distributions of metal atoms within the
   precipitates to be determined. The observation that different metals
   occupy preferred sites within the crystals indicates that these phases
   are not uniform solid solutions, but instead are chemically ordered.
   Both borides contain two distinct metal lattice sites such that the
   phases can be described as L2SB2 and L4SB3, where L and S are elements
   with larger (e.g., W, Mo) and smaller (e.g., Cr, Co, Ni) atomic numbers,
   respectively. Ordering of W and Cr is found to be particularly strong. A
   systematic search for stable phases within the chemical space of the
   W-Cr-B ternary system using the crystal structure prediction (CSP)
   program USPEX provided further insights into the nature of the observed
   chemical ordering. This combination of STEM and CSP techniques provides
   a direct and robust way of determining chemical features and local
   structures of multicomponent phases with atomic resolution even when
   particle sizes are too small for analysis using conventional methods.

AB The solvus temperature, volume fraction, coarsening behavior of gamma'
   precipitates and the partitioning behavior of alloying elements as well
   as lattice misfit of gamma/gamma' phases influence the creep behavior of
   Ni and Co-base superalloys. However, few investigations about the
   microstructural characteristics and the coarsening behavior of gamma'
   precipitates were reported in multicomponent novel Co-base superalloys
   during thermal exposure. Two alloys containing different contents of
   molybdenum and tungsten have been investigated to explore the effect of
   molybdenum on gamma' solvus temperature, gamma+gamma' microstructure and
   gamma' coarsening in Co-Al-W-Ta-Ti-base alloys. The results showed that
   the gamma' solvus temperature decreases with the addition of Mo. Mo
   addition reduces the gamma' volume fractions after aging above 1000
   degrees C, but results in negligible influence on the gamma' volume
   fractions aging at 900 degrees C. Meanwhile, gamma' coarsening is
   controlled by diffusion in experimental alloys after aging at 900
   degrees C and 1000 degrees C, and the kinetics of gamma' growth in
   experimental alloys are consistent with the predictions of LSW theory.

AB Metastability-engineering strategy is an important topic for high
   entropy alloys (HEAs), owing to the transformation-induced plasticity
   effect (TRIP). In this work, TRIP effects of Co-Cr-Fe-Ni HEAs are
   investigated. Results indicate the tensile deformation-induced
   martensitic transformation occurs in Co35Cr25Fe40-xNix (x = 0-15 at %)
   HEAs. The excellent combination of tensile strength (760 MPa-1000 MPa)
   and elongation (65-35%) owe to solid solution strengthening of Co and
   Cr, and the TRIP effect. In non-equal molar Co-Cr-Fe-Ni systems, with
   the decrease of Ni content, the values of stacking fault energy (SFE)
   decrease; thus, TRIP phenomena occurs. Based on the experimental
   investigation in three different regions of the Co-Cr-Fe-Ni
   multicomponent phase diagram, the face-centered cubic structured
   Co-Cr-Fe-Ni HEAs with VEC of similar to 8.0 is more metastable, and TRIP
   phenomena are more likely to occur.

   promising electrocatalyst to improve catalysis and lower the usage of
   the noble metal platinum. Herein, a tellurium nanowire (NW)-derived
   ternary TePtFe nanotube (NT) electrocatalyst has been prepared by the
   Kirkendall effect. The TePtFe NT formed consists of small single-crystal
   nanoparticles and voids with an open-end and hollow structure. The
   TePtFe NT electrocatalyst presents an impressive catalytic activity and
   stability for both the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and hydrogen
   evolution reaction (HER). Its ORR specific activity and mass activity
   are 8.5 and 2.4 times, respectively, improved relative to those of
   commercial platinum catalysts. It is also impressive that, for the HER,
   a very low overpotential of 28.1 mV at 10 mAcm(-2) can be achieved; this
   is lower than that of platinum (51.8 mV) catalysts in 0.1 m HClO4, and
   the activity is improved, even after 5000 cycles. This work reveals that
   TePtFe NTs can be employed as nanocatalysts with an impressive catalytic
   activity and stability for application in fuel cells and hydrogen
   production.

AB The thermodynamic extremal principle was applied to model of rapid
   solidification of non-stoichiometric intermetallic compounds and the
   Co-xat.%Si alloys (x = 50, 53, 55) were undercooled to test the model.
   It is the model with but not the model without solute drag that can be
   derived self consistently in thermodynamics. Unique dual sluggish and
   abrupt growth stages were found in under cooled Co-53 at.%Si and Co-55
   at.%Si alloys. The first (second) sluggish stage is solute-controlled
   (thermal-controlled). The first (second) abrupt growth stage is ascribed
   to the sharp occurrence of solute trapping (inverted partitioning) and
   disorder trapping that initiates the transition from solute-controlled
   (thermal-controlled) to thermal-controlled (kinetic-controlled) growth.
   Since the predictions by the current (previous) model with (without)
   solute drag predicted well (deviate drastically from) the experimental
   results, solute drag was suggested be significant upon rapid
   solidification. The current work solved such an open problem, i.e.
   solute drag in solidification, and is helpful for not only understanding
   the non-equilibrium phenomena that is of theoretical importance but also
   controlling the non equilibrium microstructures that is of technological
   importance. (C) 2018 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

   and extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy to probe the
   structure of chemically synthesized CoPt3 nanoparticles (NPs) after
   ligand removal via the commonly accepted solvent/nonsolvent approach. We
   showed that the improved catalytic activity of extensively purified NPs
   could not be explained only in terms of a "cleaner" surface. We found
   that extensive surface purification results in the substantial leaching
   of the Co atoms from the chemically synthesized CoPt3 NPs transforming
   them into CoPt3/Pt core/shell structures with an unexpectedly thick
   (similar to 0.5 nm) Pt shell. We indicated that the improved catalytic
   activity of extensively purified NPs in octyne hydrogenation reaction
   can be explained by the formation of CoPt3/Pt core/shell structures.
   Also, we demonstrated that drastic compositional and structural
   transformation of water transferred CoPt3 NPs was rather a result of
   extensive removal of native ligands via a solvent/nonsolvent approach
   than leaching of cobalt atoms in aqueous media. We expect that these
   findings can be relevant to other transition metal based multicomponent

AB Several Co-Al-(W)-based gamma-(FCC)/gamma'-(L1(2)) alloys are
   investigated to combine recent results indicating significant increases
   in the gamma'-solvus temperature with additions of Ni, Ta, and Ti, and
   reduced mass density with the substitution of Mo and Nb for W. A maximum
   solvus temperature of 1167 +/- 6 degrees C is achieved for an alloy with
   the composition Co-30Ni-7Al-4Ti-7W-1Ta (mole fraction x 100); while the
   composition Co-30Ni-7Al-4Ti-3Mo-2W-1Nb-1Ta (L19) exhibits a promising
   combination of high gamma' volume fraction and solvus temperature, low
   mass density, and excellent two-phase gamma-gamma'microstructural
   stability. Atom probe tomographic measurement of L19 aged for 4 hat 900
   degrees C indicates that Ni, Al, Ti, W, Nb, and Ta partition
   preferentially to the gamma'-precipitates while Co partitions strongly
   to the gamma-matrix. Molybdenum segregates at the gamma/gamma'
   interface, resulting in a reduction in the interfacial free energy of
   1.63 +/- 0.85 mJ m(-2). Decreasing the mole fraction of Ni from 30% to
   10% decreases the partitioning of Al and Ti to the gamma'-phase and
   increases partitioning of Co, Mo, W, Nb, and Ta to the gamma'-phase.
   From an analysis of coarsening kinetics (Ostwald ripening) at 900 C in
   Co-xNi-7Al-4Ti-3Mo-2W-1Nb-1Ta (x = 10 and 30) interfacial free energies
   of 35.0 +/- 18.6 mJ m(-2) and 29.2 +/- 15.5 mJ m(-2) are calculated for
   mole fractions of Ni of 10% and 30%, respectively. This decrease in
   interfacial free energy with increasing Ni-concentration is attributed
   partially to both Mo-segregation at the gamma-gamma' interface and a
   decrease in the lattice parameter misfit between the gamma'-precipitate
   and gamma-matrix, and concomitantly the misfit strain energy. (C) 2018

AB High entropy alloys (HEAs) have emerged as a promising class of
   equiatomic or near equiatomic multicomponent alloys, which garner
   fundamental curiosities and interest in high temperature applications.
   Understanding diffusion kinetics of HEAs is critical to assess their
   phase stability and deformation behaviour, particularly at elevated
   temperatures. For the first time, bulk tracer diffusion coefficients of
   Co, Cr, Fe and Mn are determined in polycrystalline CoCrFeNi and
   CoCrFeMnNi HEAs using the radiotracer method in the temperature interval
   of 1073-1373 K. Material homogeneity and the absence of any phase
   decomposition in CoCrFeNi and CoCrFeMnNi HEAs were established by
   electron microscopy and atom probe tomography investigations.
   Both bulk and grain boundary diffusion contributions to penetration
   profiles are observed for diffusion of Co, Cr, Fe and Mn tracers in both
   HEAs. The temperature dependencies of bulk diffusion for all tracers
   show Arrhenius behaviour. The corresponding activation energies (Q) and
   the logarithm of pre-exponential factors (Do) show a linear
   relationship, thus following the "compensation rule". An increase of the
   configurational entropy leads to reduced diffusion rates only when a
   homologous temperature scale is used for comparison. The increase of
   activation energy barrier and lower frequency factors both contribute to
   the decreased diffusion rates. A cross-over temperature (T-c = 1020 K)
   is observed for Co diffusion (on slight extrapolation of Arrhenius plot)
   in CoCrFeNi and CoCrFeMnNi HEAs, while Cr and Fe exhibit almost parallel
   Arrhenius lines. Above To, the Co diffusivity is higher in CoCrFeMnNi
   than in CoCrFeNi, which suggests that diffusion in HEAs need not be

AB A series of multicomponent Al-Co-Cr-Cu-Fe-Ni nanoparticles with
   different aluminum contents were prepared by modified arc-discharge
   method. The effect of Al element on crystal structure, microstructure,
   corrosion resistance, and soft magnetic properties were investigated.
   The evolution of phase structure changes from the initial single Cu-rich
   face-centered cubic (FCC) phase to FCC + M3Al-type L1(2) phases, and
   eventually to FCC + body-centered cubic (BCC) phases with increasing Al
   contents. Moreover, the as-prepared nanoparticles are spherical with an
   average size of about 110-180 nm, and the chemical compositions of the
   nanoparticles greatly deviate from the nominal compositions of the
   targets. Furthermore, the corrosion resistance deteriorates and the soft
   magnetic behavior increases, when the structure changes from the simple
   FCC phase to a mixture of FCC and BCC phase. The emergence of M3Al-type
   L1(2) phase in the FCC matrix brings the best corrosion resistance and
   the lowest soft magnetic property. The multicomponent nanoparticles with
   controllable structure and composition can be easily prepared by this
   method for particular applications. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB It is essential for mankind to address greenhouse gas emission,
   depletion of fossil resources and development of efficient storage and
   transportation of renewable energy. By using the atmospheric gas CO2 as
   raw material for the value-added chain, an overall CO2 neutral circular
   economy is imaginable. The power to gas (PtG) concept tackles all three
   topics by producing methane as energy carrier using renewable hydrogen
   and capture of CO2. Methanation has been known for decades; however, the
   preparation of noble metal free catalysts possessing high activity,
   selectivity and stability remains challenging. Bimetallic FexNix-1 alloy
   catalysts have shown synergistic effects for methanation as they can be
   tailored to the CO dissociation energy. Multicomponent hydrotalcite
   precursors allow close proximity of the individual metals enabling high
   dispersion and continuous variation of the composition. Herein, we
   studied Ni-Fe/(Mg, Al)O-x bimetallic catalysts derived via mixed
   hydrotalcite precursors. Iron has a significant influence on both
   activity and selectivity due to small particle sizes, facilitated CO
   dissociation, and tailored surface basicity. For the best catalyst
   (Fe/Ni = 0.1), the CO2 conversion rate reaches about 6.96 mmol CO2
   mol(Fe+Ni)(-1) s(-1) at 335 degrees C with a selectivity of 99.3% to
   CH4, remaining constant for at least 24 h time on stream.

AB The early stages of precipitation of the gamma' phase in a model Co
   based superalloy (Co-9.1Al-7W (at.%)) have been investigated at 900
   degrees C using electron microscopy and atom probe tomography.
   Nucleation, growth and coarsening stages have been studied with a focus
   on the temporal evolution of the precipitate composition in the light of
   recent theoretical developments on phase separation in multicomponent
   alloys. The experimental data have been confronted to the theories of
   nucleation and coarsening recently developed for such alloys, which are
   valid for non-ideal and non-dilute systems, and predict the temporal
   evolution of both the matrix and precipitate compositions. The rate
   constant for the mean size evolution of the particles, as derived from
   experiments, has been compared to the one predicted by the mentioned
   coarsening theory that accounts for a more accurate description of the
   thermodynamics of the phases, as compared with more classical
   approaches. From this comparison the gamma/gamma' interfacial energy was
   derived and found equal to similar to 48 mJ/m(2) The exponents for the
   temporal evolution of average particles size, number of particles per
   unit volume were found identical to those for binary alloys during the
   coarsening regime, as expected, and the temporal evolutions of
   compositions in both gamma and gamma' phases were found to evolve as
   predicted by theory. Indeed, the W content in the particles, measured
   from atom probe tomography (APT) experiments, was found to significantly
   decrease with time and the observed evolution is remarkably well
   described by the theory and therefore is shown to originate from the
   competition between diffusion and capillarity. (C) 2017 Published by

AB Rational design of effective catalysts with both high activity and
   selectivity is highly significant and desirable for hydrogenation
   reaction. In this paper, for the first time an efficient approach to
   controllably construct 1D metal nanowires (NWs) coated with hydroxide
   (NixM(OH)(2) (M = Mn, Fe, Co, Cu, and Al)) membranes as highly active
   and selective hydrogenation catalysts is reported. The optimized
   Ni32Cu(OH)(2) membrane coated Pt3Ni nanowires show much enhanced
   selectivity of 87.9% for the hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde to
   hydrocinnamaldehyde instead of hydrocinnamyl alcohol, in contrast with
   the pristine Pt3Ni nanowires and Pt3Ni nanowires on Ni(OH)(2) membranes.
   The enhanced selectivity of Pt3Ni@Ni32Cu(OH)(2)-2 NWs is ascribed to
   confinement/poisoning effects of the coated Ni32Cu(OH)(2) membranes as
   well as the intimate interaction between the Pt3Ni NWs and Ni32Cu(OH)(2)
   membranes, as confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The coated
   structures also show good stability after five recycle runs. The present
   work highlights the importance of surface engineering for the design of
   multicomponent composites with desirable activity and selectivity toward
   hydrogenation reaction and beyond.

   entropy (HE) (Fe0.25Co0.25Ni0.25Cr0.125Mo0.125)(100-x)B-x (x = 11-31

   partial replacement effect of Cr by Mo in comparison with previously
   reported HE (Fe0.25Co0.25Ni0.25Cr0.25)(100-x)B-x amorphous alloys. The
   amorphous phase was formed in a very wide B range of 11-31 at%, and
   crystallization temperature (T-x) and Vickers hardness (H-v) increased
   with increasing B content. The peak position of the X-ray diffraction
   patterns shifts to the higher diffraction angle side with increasing B
   content, implying the development of denser coordinated atomic
   configuration. There is a good linear relation between H-v and the angle
   shift of the peak position in the broad diffraction pattern. The
   crystallization mode changes from Am -> fcc + Am for the 15-20 at% B
   alloys to Am -> glass transition (GT) -> M23B6 for the 25 and 27 at% B
   alloys. It is noticed that the GT is observed for the alloys with 22-31
   at% B. The good bending ductility is obtained for the alloys up to 25
   at% B and the ductile 25 at% B alloy exhibits high T-x and high H-v.
   Considering the previous data that the Mo-free amorphous alloys are
   formed in the limited B range of 18-22 at% B and do not show the GT, the
   partial replacement of Cr by Mo is effective for the increase in
   glass-forming ability and H-v through the development of more
   coordinated atomic configuration resulting from the increase in the
   level of satisfaction of the three component rules for stabilization of
   supercooled liquid. The interpretation is also supported from the
   differences in the calculated entropy parameters between the HE
   amorphous alloys and HE crystalline solid solution alloys. The first
   formation of an amorphous phase for the lower and higher B content
   alloys of 11-14 and 26-31 at% is also promising for future application
   to structural materials. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB High-entropy alloys have attracted much attention due to their unique
   microstructures and excellent properties. Since their invention more
   than ten years ago, research attention has been mainly focused on the
   study of multicomponent alloys with equiatomic or near-equiatomic
   compositions. Here we propose a novel design of non-equiatomic
   medium-entropy alloys that contain one matrix element and several
   equiatomic alloying elements. To verify the utility of this new design,
   a series of Co-free Fe-x(CrNiAl)(100-x) (at.%, 25 <= x <= 65)
   medium-entropy alloys were designed from the much-studied FeNiCrCoAl
   high-entropy alloy. Detailed characterization reveals that the alloys
   exhibit novel twophase microstructures consisting of B2-ordered
   nanoprecipitates and BCC-disordered matrix. As the alloys deviate far
   from equiatomic composition, the structure of the nanoprecipitates
   transfers from a spinodal-like intertwined structure to a nanoparticle
   dispersed structure. Previous parametric approaches to predict phase
   formation rules for high-entropy alloys are unable to describe the phase
   separation behaviors in the studied alloys. Our findings provide a new
   route to design medium-entropy alloys and also demonstrate a strategy
   for designing nanostructured alloys from multicomponent alloy systems
   through simple variations in non-equiatomic compositions.

AB In order to improve the plasticity of AlCoCrFeNi high entropy alloys
   (HEA) without obviously decreasing the strength, Co has been added to
   this alloy as Co is a FCC phase stabilizer. In this study, the alloying
   effects of Co addition on the phase types, microstructure and mechanical
   properties of (AlCoCrFeNi)(100-x)Co-x are investigated systematically.
   The result shows that Co element has the capacity to induce phase
   transformation from BCC phase to FCC phase in the
   (AlCoCrFeNi)(100-x)Co-x alloy system, and the volume fraction of FCC
   phase increases from 0% to 77% as the Co content increases. Compressive
   testing shows that Co addition has a positive effect in improving the
   plasticity of AlCoCrFeNi HEA, and the fracture strain increases
   gradually from 27% to 40%, while the ultimate strength only reduces from
   2743 MPa to 2680 MPa as the Co content changes from 0 to 16 at%. The
   maximum ultimate compressive strength reaches 2974 MPa, while the
   fracture strain reaches 30%. The increased volume fraction of FCC phase
   is the main factor in the plasticity increases, and the valence electron
   concentration (VEC) increase induced by Co addition is the main factor
   in FCC phase volume fraction increases in this alloy.

AB Multi-component alloys containing at least five elements in equimolar or
   near equimolar ratio are commonly known as High-Entropy Alloys. Despite
   the complex chemical composition, with the fulfilment of specific
   thermodynamic parameters, they are characterized by the existence of
   simple phases. During designing process of such materials VEC (Valance
   Electron Concentration) parameter is commonly used to predict the
   crystallographic structure of the alloy. Calculations are based on the
   percentage of individual elements and the number of each valence
   electron. Research presents the effect of chromium addition on the
   structure and microstructure of alloys from Al-Ti-Co-Ni-Fe-(Cr) system.
   The assumption is, that the addition of chromium will lower the value of
   the VEC parameter, and will results in the transition from FCC structure
   to FCC + BCC structure. Such crystallographic change should additionally
   lead to significant changes in the properties of these alloys, e.g. by
   hardness increasing.

AB Common method of oxidized nickel ores processing includes ore feeding in
   countercurrent with high-temperature waste gases, melting in bubbling
   zone of a two-zone furnace, supplying carbonaceous fuel and
   oxygen-containing blasting to produce melt that is reduced by solid
   reducing agent in plasma zone when heated with nitrogen. The main
   disadvantages of this method are low nickel content in alloy and
   presence of silicon, carbon, chromium and other impurities. To improve
   quality of ferronickel, it is proposed to use converted natural gas in
   plasma zone, which, when processed by plasma, is not only a heat
   carrier, but also a reducing agent. The method is based on assumption
   that at melt bubbling, composition of gas in bubbles that reached bath
   surface is close to equilibrium. Gas-reducing agent is obtained by
   oxygen conversion of natural gas with ratio alpha equal to 0.25; 0.35
   and 0.50 respectively ( T = 1823 K). Based on calculations, dependencies
   of content of nickel and iron oxides in silicate melt, degree of their
   reduction, ratio of slag and metal and nickel content in the alloy on
   total gas flow determined as the product of the gas amount in a single
   batch and the number of calculation cycles, as well as the amount of
   nickel and iron, reduced by a single portion of gas are revealed.
   Regardless of proportion of hydrogen and carbon monoxide in source
   gases, increase in their consumption monotonously reduces content of
   nickel oxide in the melt, while content of iron oxide initially
   increases, and then decreases. When melt is blown with natural gas
   conversion products with alpha = 0.25, reduction process takes place due
   to hydrogen, effect of CO is insignificant. Flow rate of 54 m3/t of gas
   allows to achieve 98.5 % degree of nickel reduction, content of nickel
   oxide in melt is 0.028 %, ratio of slag and metal is 46 units. At equal
   gas consumption, with increase in proportions of CO2 and H2O in the
   initial mixture, by increasing alpha, values of metals reduction from
   melt deteriorate: value s of C NiO and C FeO and ratio of slag and metal
   increase, and degree of nickel and iron reduction decreases. Comparison
   of results with previously obtained data on metals reduction from
   similar melts by carbon monoxide and hydrogen has shown that hydrogen
   has greater efficiency, somewhat worse results are demonstrated when
   converted gas with alpha = 0.25 is applied. Nickel reduction by
   converted gas (alpha = 0.35) to reduction rate of 88 %, which
   corresponds to its consumption of 60 m3/t, is more effective than by
   pure CO. However, final values of degree of reduction using converted
   gas reach 90 %, while for CO they approach 100 %.
Z4 Известный способ переработки окисленных никелевых руд включает подачу
   руды в противотоке с высокотемпературными отходящими газами, плавку в
   барботажной зоне двухзонной печи, подачу углеродсодержащего топлива и
   кислородсодержащего дутья и получение расплава, который
   восстанавливается твердым восстановителем в плазменной зоне при нагреве
   азотом. Основной недостаток этого спососба - низкое содержание никеля в
   сплаве, наличие кремния, углерода, хрома и других примесей. Для
   повышения качества ферроникеля предложено в плазменной зоне использовать
   конвертированный природный газ, который при обработке плазмой будет
   являться не только теплоносителем, но и восстановителем. Методом
   термодинамического моделирования, в основе которого лежит допущение о
   том, что при барботаже ванны с расплавом состав газа в достигших
   поверхности всплывающих пузырях близок к равновесному, описаны процессы
   совместного восстановления никеля и железа в системе 1,8 % NiO - 17,4 %
   FeO - 13,5 % CaO - 1,9 % MgO - 58,0 % SiO2 - 7,4 % Al2O3, близкой по
   составу к магнезиальным никелевым рудам. Газ-восстановитель получен в
   результате кислородной конверсии природного газа с коэффициентом расхода
   (alpha) 0,25, 0,35 и 0,50 (при температуре 1823 К). В результате
   проведенных расчетов выявлены зависимости содержания оксидов никеля и
   железа в силикатном расплаве, степени их восстановления, кратности шлака
   и содержания никеля в сплаве от общего расхода газа, определяемого как
   произведение количества газа в единичной порции на количество расчетных
   циклов, а также количества никеля и железа, восстановленных единичной
   порцией газа. Независимо от доли водорода и оксида углерода в исходных
   газах увеличение их расхода монотонно снижает содержание оксида никеля в
   расплаве, в то время как содержание оксида железа первоначально
   возрастает, а затем - снижается. При продувке расплава продуктами
   конверсии природного газа с alpha = 0,25 процесс восстановления
   протекает за счет водорода, влияние СО незначительно. Расход 54 м3/т
   газа позволяет достигнуть степени восстановления никеля 98,5 %,
   содержания оксида никеля в расплаве 0,028 %, кратности шлака 46 единиц.
   При одинаковом расходе газа с увеличением в исходной смеси долей СО2 и
   Н2О за счет повышения alpha ухудшаются показатели восстановления
   металлов из расплава: значения С NiO и С FeO и кратность шлака
   повышаются, а степени восстановления никеля и железа снижаются.
   Сравнение результатов с ранее полученными данными по восстановлению
   металлов из аналогичных расплавов оксидом углерода и водородом показало,
   что большей эффективностью обладает водород, несколько хуже показатели
   при использовании конвертированного газа с alpha = 0,25. Восстановление
   никеля конвертированным газом (alpha = 0,35) до степени восстановления
   88 %, что соответствует его расходу 60 м3/т, происходит более
   эффективно, чем чистым СО. Однако конечные степени восстановления при
   использовании конвертированного газа достигают 90 %, в то время как при
   использовании СО приближаются к 100 %.

AB The thermodynamic modeling method, which is based on calculation of the
   equilibrium in «oxide melt-metal-gas» system, is intended to describe
   the bubbling reduction of metals from a multicomponent oxide melt by
   reducing gas. Originality of the technique is that the equilibrium was
   determined for each unit dose of gas introduced into the working body,
   with contents of the metals oxides being reduced in each subsequent
   design cycle equal to equilibrium in the previous one. This approach
   allows modeling processes and qualitatively assessment of the
   completeness of reactions in pyrometallurgical aggregates using blowing
   the melt with reducing gas. The initial oxide system NiO (1.8 %) - FeO
   (17.4) - CaO (13.5) - MgO (1.9) - SiO (58.0) - Al O (7.4 %) Moscow,
   Russiaby content of the components close 2 2 3 to the
   correspondedcomposition of oxidized nickel ore. The ratio of CO2 /CO in
   the gas mixture varied between 0 and 0.33. Depending on the amount and
   composition of the gas introduced into the working body, content of
   nickel and iron oxides in the melt (1823 K) was evaluated, the amount
   and composition of the formed metal (ferronickel) was determined, as
   well as the parameters (ratio of slag and metal, reduction degree of
   metals) that are important in the process implementation in industrial
   conditions. Increase in the consumption of pure carbon monoxide
   monotonously reduces the content of nickel oxide in the melt, while the
   content of iron oxide at the beginning increases, and then decreases.
   With the introduction of CO in the amount of about 100 m3 per ton of the
   melt, the content of nickel oxide in it is reduced to 0.05 %, and of
   iron oxide - to 17 %. The resulting ferronickel contains 70 % Ni, the
   ratio of slag and metal is 41 units. A further increase in CO
   consumption leads to preferential iron reduction. Increase in the CO2
   /CO ratio worsens the recovery of metals from the melt: the degree of
   reduction of nickel and iron decreases, Ni content in the alloy
   increases and the ratio of slag and metal increases. At CO2 /CO equal to
   0.33 corresponding to 25 % CO2 in the gas mixture the reduction process
   stops. On the basis of the data obtained, it is proposed to process
   oxidized nickel ore in two stages, the first of which is melt bubbling
   by gas (preferably, pure CO) to the degree of nickel reduction of 80 -
   85 % and to separate ferronickel with 70 % Ni. Further reduction of
   metals from the oxide melt (second stage) can be carried out by known
   carbothermic methods.
Z4 Методика термодинамического моделирования, в основе которой лежит расчет
   равновесия в системе «оксидный расплав - металл - газ», предназначена
   для описания процесса барботажного восстановления металлов из
   многокомпонентного оксидного расплава газом-восстановителем.
   Оригинальность методики состоит в том, что равновесие определялось для
   каждой единичной порции газа, вводимой в рабочее тело, при содержаниях
   оксидов восстанавливаемых металлов в каждом последующем расчетном цикле,
   равных равновесным в предыдущем. Этот подход позволяет моделировать
   процессы и качественно оценить полноту протекания реакций в
   пирометаллургических агрегатах, использующих продувку расплава
   газом-восстановителем. Исходная оксидная система NiO (1,8 %) - FeO
   (17,4) - CaO (13,5) - MgO (1,9) - SiO2 (58,0) - Al2O3 (7,4) по
   содержанию компонентов близко отвечала составу окисленной никелевой
   руды. Соотношение СО2 / СО в газовой смеси варьировалось в пределах 0 /
   0,33. В зависимости от количества и состава газа, введенного в рабочее
   тело, оценивали содержание оксидов никеля и железа в расплаве (1823 К),
   определяли количество и состав образующегося металла (ферроникеля), а
   также показатели (кратность шлака, степени восстановления металлов),
   важные при реализации процесса в промышленных условиях. Увеличение
   расхода чистого монооксида углерода монотонно снижает содержание оксида
   никеля в расплаве, в то время как содержание оксида железа первоначально
   возрастает, а затем снижается. При введении СО в количестве около 100 м3
   на тонну расплава, содержание оксида никеля в нем снижается до 0,05 %, а
   оксида железа до 17 %. Образующийся ферроникель содержит 70 % Ni,
   кратность шлака составляет 41 единицу. Дальнейшее увеличение расхода СО
   ведет к предпочтительному восстановлению железа. Повышение соотношения
   СО2 /СО ухудшает показатели восстановления металлов из расплава:
   уменьшается степень восстановления никеля и железа, увеличивается
   содержание никеля в сплаве и кратность шлака. При СО2 /СО, равном 0,33,
   что соответствует 25% СО2 в смеси газов, процесс восстановления
   прекращается. На основании полученных данных предложено перерабатывать
   окисленную никелевую руду в две стадии, на первой из которых вести
   барботаж расплава газом (предпочтительно чистым СО) до степени
   восстановления никеля 80 - 85 % и выделять ферроникель с 70 % Ni.
   Дальнейшее восстановление металлов из оксидного расплава (вторая стадия)
   можно вести известными карботермическими методами.

AB A number of technologies in ferrous and non-ferrous metallurgy are based
   on bubbling processes. For prediction of melting parameters including
   the reduction of metals from oxide melt by a reducing gas in a bubbling
   layer in industrial aggregates, a thermodynamic modeling technique is
   proposed based on calculation of the equilibrium in oxide-melt-metal-gas
   system. Originality of the technique is that equilibrium is determined
   for each unit dose of gas introduced into the working body, with the
   contents of oxides of metals being reduced in each subsequent design
   cycle equal to the equilibrium in the previous one. For the analysis NiO
   (1.8 %) - FeO (17.4 %) - CaO (13.5 %) - MgO (1.9 %) - SiO2 (58.0 %) -
   Al2O3 (7.4 %) oxide system was taken, closely corresponding to
   composition of oxidized nickel ore. The ratio of Н2О/Н2 in gas mixture
   varies between 0 and 1.0. (1823 K), amount and composition of formed
   metal (ferronickel), as well as the indices (the ratio of slag and
   metal, the degree of reduction of metals) are important in
   implementation of the process under commodity conditions. The increase
   in hydrogen consumption monotonously reduces the content of nickel oxide
   in the melt, while the content of iron oxide initially increases, and
   then decreases. When H2 is introduced in an amount of about 50 m3 per
   ton of the melt, the content of nickel oxide in it is reduced to 0.017
   %, and of iron oxide to 16.7 %. Resulting ferronickel contains 61 % Ni,
   ratio of slag and metal - 42 units. Further increase in H2 consumption
   leads to preferential iron reduction. An increase in H2O/H2 ratio
   worsens the results of reduction of metals from the melt: decrease in
   degree of reduction of nickel and iron, increase in nickel content in
   the alloy, and the ratio of slag and metal. However, even with a H2 /
   H2O ratio of 1.0, which corresponds to 50 % of H2O in the gas mixture,
   reduction process does not stop. For comparison, the work presents data
   on change in content of nickel and iron oxides, when metals are restored
   from similar melts with carbon monoxide. At a nickel recovery rate of 98
   %, indicators are close in case of using both H2 and CO. However, to
   achieve them, it is required 2.5 times less hydrogen, and 1.36 times
   less mixture in which H2O/H2 = 0.11 (H2 - 90 %) than carbon monoxide.
Z4 В черной и цветной металлургии разработан ряд технологий, в основе
   которых лежат барботажные процессы. Для прогнозирования параметров
   плавки, включающей восстановление металлов из оксидного расплава
   газом-восстановителем в барботируемом слое в промышленных агрегатах,
   предложена методика термодинамического моделирования, в основе которой
   лежит расчет равновесия в системе оксидный расплав - металл - газ.

   % NiO - 17,4 % FeO - 13,5 % CaO -1,9 % MgO - 58,0 % SiO2 - 7,4 % Al2O3,
   по содержанию компонентов близкая к составу окисленной никелевой руды.
   Соотношение H2O/H2 в газовой смеси варьировали в пределах 0 - 1,0. В
   зависимости от количества и состава газа, введенного в рабочее тело,
   оценивали содержание оксидов никеля и железа в расплаве (1823 К),
   определяли количество и состав образующегося металла (ферроникеля), а
   также показатели (кратность шлака, степени восстановления металлов),
   важные при реализации процесса в промышленных условиях. Увеличение
   расхода водорода монотонно снижает содержание оксида никеля в расплаве,
   в то время как содержание оксида железа первоначально возрастает, а
   затем - снижается. При введении H в количестве около 50 м3/т расплава
   содержание оксида никеля в нем снижается до 0,017 %, а оксида железа до
   16,7 %. Образующийся ферроникель содержит 61 % никеля, кратность шлака
   составляет 42 единицы. Дальнейшее увеличение расхода H2 ведет к
   предпочтительному восстановлению железа. Повышение соотношения H2O/H2
   ухудшает показатели восстановления металлов из расплава: уменьшается
   степень восстановления никеля и железа, увеличивается содержание никеля
   в сплаве и кратность шлака. Однако даже при соотношении H2 /H2O равном
   1,0, что соответствует содержанию 50,0 % H2O в смеси газов, процесс
   восстановления не прекращается. Для сравнения в работе приведены данные
   по изменению содержания оксидов никеля и железа при восстановлении
   металлов из аналогичных расплавов монооксидом углерода. При степени
   восстановления никеля 98 % показатели близки в случае использования как
   Н2, так и СО. Однако для их достижения водорода требуется в 2,5 раза, а
   смеси, в которой Н2О/Н2 = 0,11 (90 % Н2 ), - в 1,36 раз меньше, чем
   монооксида углерода.

AB The decarburisation process is studied with the help of mathematical
   modelling of RH degasser with reaction interface area approach,
   considering multi-component mixed phase mass transport theory. An
   algorithm is developed by considering Ar gas, bath surface and CO gas
   bubbles as the reaction sites for decarburisation process. On the basis
   of this, the model is developed using MATLAB. The model is tested with
   five sets of data which are obtained from JSW Steel Plant Ltd. The
   results obtained from the model have been compared with the industrial
   data as well as the data obtained from literature survey. It is shown
   that the nitrogen and hydrogen removal are triggered more for higher CO
   evolution rate. The relations between carbon removal and factors like
   area of interface, time and vacuum pressure are proposed.

AB The object of the study is a multilayered surface composition "Steel - a
   Multicomponent material with Shape Memory Effect - a wear-resistant
   layer" under conditions of cavitation effects in sea water.
   Multicomponent TiNi-based coatings with addition of alloying elements
   such as Zr in an amount up to 10% mass, allow to create a composite
   material with a gradient of properties at the interface of layers, which
   gives new properties to coatings and improves their performance
   significantly. The use of materials with shape memory effect (SME) as
   surface layers or in the composition of surface layered compositions
   allows to provide an effective reaction of materials to the influence of
   external factors and adaptation to external influences. The surface
   composite layer cBN-10%Co has high hardness and strength, which ensures
   its resistance to shock cyclic influences of collapsing caverns. The
   increased roughness of the surface of a solid surface composite in the
   form of strong columnar structures ensures the crushing of vacuum voids,
   redistributing their effect on the entire surface, and not concentrating
   them in certain zones. In addition, the gradient structure of the
   multilayer composite coating TiNi-Ti33Ni49Zr18-cBN-10%Co Co makes it
   possible to create conditions for the relaxation of stresses created by
   the variable impact load of cavitation caverns and the manifestation of
   compensating internal forces due to thermo-elastic martensitic
   transformations of SME materials. The cavitation resistance of the
   coating TiNi-Ti(33)Ni(49)Zr(18)cBN-10%Co according to the criterion of
   mass wear is 15-20 times higher than that of the base material without
   coating and 10-12 times higher than that of the TiNi-TiNiZr coating. The
   proposed architecture of the multifunctional gradient composition,
   "steel-Ni-TiNi-Ti33Ni49Zr18-cBN-10%Co", each layer of which has its
   functional purpose, allows to increase the service life of parts
   operating under conditions of cavitation-fatigue loading in corrosive
   environments.

AB The corrosion properties of multicomponent primarily casted and 100%
   recasted Ni- and Co-based dental alloys produced by the methods of
   powder metallurgy (PM) have been studied. Alloys are designed for
   porcelain fused to metal (PFM) reconstructions and have been
   investigated by means of two methods: static immersion in solutions
   which pH mimics aggressive environment in human cavity and by open
   circuit potential (OCP) measurements. The first one has been used to
   determine amounts of Ni2+ and Co2+ ions released under the influence of
   corrosion phenomena in standardized conditions. The OCP method has been
   used to assess the corrosion stability of primarily casted and 100%
   recasted Co- and Ni-alloys in some typical media: physiological
   solution, 0.05M HCl, Coca-Cola and fresh orange juice. Correlations
   between the composition of specimens, acidity of the environment and the
   corrosion resistance of the alloys have been established. It was shown
   that the amount of Ni2+ and Co2+ emitted during the immersion tests were
   far below the standardized threshold limiting application of dental
   alloys. It was also shown that all Co base alloys have higher stability
   and the decreasing of pH leads to a decrease of the corrosion
   resistance. Results show that there was no significant difference in the
   corrosion potential values among the groups of primarily cast and 100%
   recast Ni- and Co-base metal alloys in HCl at pH 1.3. It was
   demonstrated that the high corrosion resistance and hence the strong
   biocompatibility of Ni- and Co-based dental alloys are result of the
   innovative PM production method used.

   investigation of their various electrical and optical properties. The
   composite materials were prepared by co precipitation method with
   general composition of Sr0.5Gd0.3(ZrO2) x moles, thus obtained hybrid

   perovskite hybrid nanooxide multicomponent pure isolated material with
   different concentrations (1-5 molar %). The dielectric constants of the
   pelletalized samples have been examined at room temperature. The
   precursor material for the synthesis is strontium carbonate and
   gadolinium chloride which were reduced in presence of surfactant
   triethanol amine (TEA). The aqueous mixture of reddish brown coloured
   hybrid metal hydroxides are filtered, washed with ethanol-water mixture
   (1:9 volume) to remove any impurities present with the precipitate, the
   precipitate is dried at 50-100 degrees C, further heat treated at
   650-750 degrees C and obtained pure nanocomposite. Scanning electron
   microscopic studies revealed that the doped ZrO2 grain size was 30-50nm
   in diameter and it's over layer is 90% optically transparent. XRD
   pattern demonstrated the formation of tetragonal zirconia and dopant
   addition considerably does not affect the crystal structure. Higher

AB Co is considered to be one of the main ingredients in superalloys. Co is
   considered a critical element and its substitution is difficult due to
   its unique ability to form high temperature stable structures with high
   mechanical and corrosion/oxidation resistance. High entropy alloys (HEA)
   represent a relatively new concept in material design. HEA are
   characterised by a high number of alloying elements, in unusually high
   proportion. Due to their specific particularities, high entropy alloys
   tend to form predominant solid solution structures that develop
   potentially high chemical, physical and mechanical properties. Present
   paper is studying Co-less high entropy alloys with high potential in
   severe environment applications. The high entropy alloys based on
   Al-Cr-Fe-Mn-Ni system were prepared by induction melting and casting
   under protective atmosphere. The as-cast specimens were heat treated at
   various temperatures to determine the structure and property behaviour.
   Samples taken before and after heat treatment were investigated for
   chemical, physical, structural and mechanical characteristics. Sigma
   phase composition and heat treatment parameters had major influence over
   the resulted alloy structure and properties.

   alloys grow more complex, especially with the discovery of high-entropy
   alloys (HEAs) in 2004. Information about their liquid state behavior is
   scarce, and potentially quite complex due to the presence of perhaps
   five or more elements in equimolar ratios. These alloys are showing
   promise as high strength materials, many composed of solid-solution
   phases containing equiatomic CoCrCu, which itself does not form a
   ternary solid solution. Instead, this compound solidifies into highly
   phase separated regions, and the liquid phase separation that occurs in
   the alloy also leads to phase separation in systems in which Co, Cr, and
   Cu are present. The present study demonstrates that in-situ neutron
   imaging of the liquid phase separation in CoCrCu can be observed. The
   neutron imaging of the solidification process may resolve questions
   about phase separation that occurs in these alloys and those that
   contain Cu. These results show that neutron imaging can be utilized as a
   characterization technique for solidification research with the
   potential for imaging the liquid phases of more complex alloys, such as
   the HEAs which have very little published data about their liquid
   phases. This imaging technique could potentially allow for observation
   of immiscible liquid phases becoming miscible at specific temperatures,
   which cannot be observed with ex-situ analysis of solidified structures.

AB Five TiCrBN coatings have been successfully fabricated by adopting
   hybrid co-deposition and superimposition concepts into high power
   impulse magnetron sputtering. The medium-frequency (MF) pulses were
   superimposed during the off-time of HiPIMS pulsing to Ti target. The
   direct-current (DC) and radio-frequency (RF) powers were connected to
   TiB2 and Cr targets, respectively. A plasma emission monitoring (PEM)
   system was used to grow thin films by tailoring the Ti target in
   transition and poisoning regimes, respectively. The different PEM set
   points, i.e., different target transition or poisoned regions, were
   selected to study their effects on the properties of deposited TiCrBN
   film. The deposition rate of TiCrBN films increased 1.64 times higher
   when the Ti target status changed from poisoning to transition regime by
   selecting PEM set points tuning from 30% to 70%. All samples exhibited a
   fine and dense microstructure, and a very smooth surface with the
   average roughness < 1 nm. The coefficient of friction and wear rate of
   each coating were in the ranges of 0.47-0.58 and 1.59-9.82 x 10(-6)
   mm(3) N-1 m(-1), respectively. The highest hardness of 38.9 GPa, elastic
   modulus of 374 GPa, acceptable adhesion quality of HF3 and upper
   critical load of 30 N were obtained for T50% sample, which was grown at
   the PEM set point of 50%, in the transition region of Ti target and
   under the highest HiPIMS peak power density. This study also
   demonstrates the potential application of PEM apparatus attached to a
   superimposed HiPIMS-MF deposition technique for tailoring the growth of
   multicomponent metal nitride hard coatings.

AB Ti50Zr27Cu8Ni4Co3Fe2Al3Sn3 (at%) amorphous filler metal with low Cu and
   Ni contents in a melt-spun ribbon form was developed for improving
   mechanical properties of Ti-6Al-4V alloy brazing joint through
   decreasing brittle intermetallics in the braze zone. Investigation on
   the crystallization behavior of the multicomponent
   Ti-Zr-Cu-Ni-Co-Fe-Al-Sn amorphous alloy indicates the high stability of
   the supercooled liquid against crystallization that favors the formation
   of amorphous structure. The Ti-6Al-4V joint brazed with this Ti-based
   amorphous filler metal with low total content of Cu and Ni at 1203 K for
   900 s mainly consists of alpha-Ti, alpha-Ti, minor Ti-Zr-rich phase and
   only a small amount of Ti3Cu intermetallics, leading to the high shear
   strength of the joint of about 460 MPa. Multicomponent composition
   design of amorphous alloys is an effective way of tailoring filler
   metals for improving the joint strength.

   composition and morphologies of CoNi, CoNi@SiO2 and CoNi@SiO2@RGO are
   analyzed in detail. Besides, the electromagnetic (EM) wave absorption
   performances of the as-prepared products are invested on the basis of
   transmission lines theory. The results indicate that the ternary
   CoNi@SiO2@RGO composites display enhanced microwave-absorbing
   characteristics in terms of both the maximum reflection loss and the
   absorption bandwidth, compared with the pristine CoNi alloy and
   CoNi@SiO2 microparticles. The maximum R-L of CoNi@SiO2@RGO reaches as
   high as -50.3 dB at 6.8 GHz, and the absorption bandwidth below -10 dB
   is up to 4.0 GHz with a thickness of 4 mm. A possible mechanism of
   microwave absorption is explained, drawing a conclusion that the
   improvement of absorption property is mainly ascribed to the synergic
   effect of combining magnetic and dielectric components, and the
   interface interactions of multi-component hierarchical structure.

AB Fabrication of near-net shaped B4C-Co and ZrC-Co composites by slip

   and ZrC-Co concentrated suspensions can be prepared by aqueous colloidal
   processing, and optimized (in terms of pH, deflocculant contents, and
   sonication time) to have a shear-thinning rheological behaviour suitable
   for the near-net shaping of the corresponding cermet compacts by slip
   casting. It is also demonstrated that the robust, highly-dense compacts
   so obtained have a uniform green microstructure without macro-defects or
   gradient density, and which can be fully densified by pressureless
   sintering. Specifically, it is shown that B4C-Co compacts densify by
   reactive and transient liquid-phase sintering, thus resulting in
   multi-component ceramics. ZrC-Co compacts densify however by persistent
   liquid-phase sintering, thus resulting in cermets. An explanation is

   the near-net shape manufacture of these and similar carbide-metal

AB We propose a first-principles framework for longitudinal spin
   fluctuations (LSFs) in disordered paramagnetic (PM) multicomponent alloy
   systems and apply it to investigate the influence of LSFs on the
   temperature dependence of two elastic constants of PM austenitic
   stainless steel Fe15Cr15Ni. The magnetic model considers individual
   fluctuating moments in a static PM medium with first-principles-derived
   LSF energetics in conjunction with describing chemical disorder and
   randomness of the transverse magnetic component in the single-site alloy
   formalism and disordered local moment (DLM) picture. A
   temperature-sensitive mean magnetic moment is adopted to accurately
   represent the LSF state in the elastic-constant calculations. We make
   evident that magnetic interactions between an LSF impurity and the PM
   medium are weak in the present steel alloy. This allows gaining accurate
   LSF energetics and mean magnetic moments already through a perturbation
   from the static DLM moments instead of a tedious self-consistent
   procedure. We find that LSFs systematically lower the cubic shear
   elastic constants c' and c(44) by similar to 6 GPa in the temperature
   interval 300-1600 K, whereas the predominant mechanism for the softening
   of both elastic constants with temperature is the magneto-volume
   coupling due to thermal lattice expansion. We find that non-negligible
   local magnetic moments of Cr and Ni are thermally induced by LSFs, but
   they exert only a small influence on the elastic properties. The
   proposed framework exhibits high flexibility in accurately accounting
   for finite-temperature magnetism and its impact on the mechanical
   properties of PM multicomponent alloys.

   series) containing 0 to 15 at. pct of Co addition were investigated to
   understand the formation behavior of TCP phases. Significant difference
   on the formation behavior of TCP phases and corresponding Co effect was
   found in two series alloys. TCP precipitates (P and mu phase) were
   observed in both grain interiors and boundaries in Ni-Cr-Mo series
   alloys. Higher levels of Co addition increased the supersaturation of Mo
   in the gamma matrix, which explained that Co addition promoted mu phase
   formation. In contrast, the TCP precipitates (sigma phase) formed by the
   manner of discontinuous precipitation transformation in the grain
   boundaries in Ni-Cr-Re series alloys. More Co additions suppressed the
   formation of sigma phase, which was mainly attributed to the decreased
   supersaturation of Re in thermodynamically metastable gamma matrix. The
   information obtained from simplified alloy systems in this study is
   helpful for the design of multicomponent Ni-based superalloys. (C) The

AB Uranium-based amorphous alloys are a unique family of amorphous
   materials, which have so far been less studied due to the high chemical
   activity and radioactivity of uranium metal. In this paper, we review
   the compositions, preparations and thermal stability characteristics of
   U-based amorphous alloys obtained in the early experimental studies, and
   summarizes our recent results of the preparations and material
   properties of stable U-based amorphous alloys. The latest progress in
   our study of U-based amorphous alloys is presented in the three aspects.
   Firstly, the preparation methods, alloy systems and compositions,
   formation and crystallization behaviors of the new U-based amorphous
   alloys, along with the preliminary mechanisms for their formation and
   structure stabilization are reviewed. A number of new uranium-based
   amorphous alloy systems have been established based on eutectic law and
   structural packing model. These alloys show high ability to form glass,
   and the reduction of glass transition temperatures of some alloys to
   those of conventional amorphous alloys. The formation rules of binary
   (U-Fe/U-Co/U-Cr), ternary (U-Co-Al/U-Fe-Sn) and multicomponent alloy
   system have been investigated. It was found that the ability to form
   glass is strongly related to some physical parameters such as the local
   cluster structure, the electron concentration, the enthalpy of mixing,
   the electronegativity of the alloy component as well as the atomic size.
   The fragilities of U-based amorphous alloys indicate that they belong to
   a class of strong glass forming system, which means that the critical
   dimensions of such amorphous alloys can be further enhanced, and bulk
   amorphous samples are expected to be prepared. The crystallization
   activation of this kind of amorphous alloy is higher, and the
   crystallization process is dominated by nucleation. Then, the
   microstructures especially the first high-resolution electron
   microscopic results of the unique amorphous materials are reviewed.
   Finally, the micro-mechanical and anti-corrosion properties are reported
   in great detail. It is found that Ubased amorphous materials show
   excellent mechanical properties and corrosion resistance, and the
   strength and hardness are much higher than those of conventional
   crystalline uranium alloys, and the corrosion resistance is also
   superior to the latter, which may be caused by its disorderly amorphous
   structural characteristics. Amorphous alloys have been the subject of
   intense fundamental and application research in recent years. Stable
   U-based amorphous alloys appear to cover all physical phenomena
   displayed by amorphous alloys. The discovery of outstanding properties
   in these new alloys therefore would stimulate both the fundamental
   studies including structure, electronic, glass transition,
   crystallization, etc., and the application-orientated studies of the
   thermal stability, mechanical and corrosion properties.

AB A new face-centered cubic (fcc) high entropy alloy system with
   non-equiatomic compositions has been designed by utilizing a CALculation

   The new alloy system is based on the representative fcc high entropy
   alloy, the Cantor alloy which is an equiatomic Co- Cr-Fe-Mn-Ni
   five-component alloy, but fully or partly replace the cobalt by vanadium
   and is of non-equiatomic compositions. Alloy compositions expected to
   have an fcc single-phase structure between 700 A degrees C and melting
   temperatures are proposed. All the proposed alloys are experimentally
   confirmed to have the fcc single-phase during materials processes (> 800
   A degrees C), through an X-ray diffraction analysis. It is shown that
   there are more chances to find fcc single-phase high entropy alloys if
   paying attention to non-equiatomic composition regions and that the
   CALPHAD thermodynamic calculation can be an efficient tool for it. An
   alloy design technique based on thermodynamic calculation is
   demonstrated and the applicability and limitation of the approach as a
   design tool for high entropy alloys is discussed.

AB A combinatorial assessment of composition-microstructure-magnetic
   property relationships in magnetic high entropy AlCoxCr1-xFeNi alloy
   (0x1) system has been carried out using compositionally graded alloys
   fabricated via laser additive manufacturing. At one end, the AlCoFeNi
   composition (x=1) consisted of equiaxed B2 grains, exhibiting very early
   stages of phase separation (only compositional partitioning) into Ni-Al
   rich and Fe-Co rich regions within grains of the B2 phase. At the other
   extreme, the AlCrFeNi composition (x=0) exhibited grains with pronounced
   spinodal decomposition, resulting in a B2+bcc microstructure with the
   degree of spinodal decomposition progressively increasing with Cr
   content in these AlCoxCr1-xFeNi alloys. While the saturation
   magnetization (M-s) monotonically increases six times from x=0 to x=1,
   the coercivity (H-c) variation is non-monotonic, increasing seven times
   from x=0 to x=0.4, and subsequently decreasing fourteen times from x=0.4
   to x=1.0. The magnetic phase transition temperature (T-c) for these
   alloys also increases monotonically with increasing Co content with a
   second phase transition exhibited in a certain range of compositions
   between x=0.6 to x=0.8. Such substantial changes in the magnetization
   behavior and properties of magnetic high entropy systems opens
   possibilities of tuning these alloys for specific soft or hard magnetic
   component applications.

AB As proposed in the 1920s, the empirical Hume-Rothery rules have been
   guiding the alloy design for random solid solutions. In contrast, the
   recent proposal by Yeh et al. (Adv Eng Mater 6(5): 299-303, 2004)
   suggested that formation of random solid solution could be attributed to
   the maximized configurational entropy of mixing of multicomponent
   alloys, also known as high entropy alloys. By taking into account the
   non-ideal mixing of atoms with inter-atomic correlations (correlated
   mixing), here we suggest that the idea of entropic stabilization could
   be theoretically connected with the Hume-Rothery rules. The non-ideal
   formulation of the configurational entropy of mixing of a multicomponent
   alloy rationalizes the recent data obtained from experiments and
   simulations, which show the temperature dependence of the
   configurational entropy of mixing, the metastability of random solid
   solution observed at a low temperature, and the coupled effect of atomic
   size and chemical bond misfit on the stability of random solid solution.
   Finally, we discuss the measures that one can take to maximize the
   configurational entropy of a multicomponent alloy by considering the
   possible correlations among their constituent elements.

AB In this report, a combination of the diffusion multiple technique and
   the recently developed pragmatic numerical inverse method was employed
   for a high-throughput determination of interdiffusivity matrices in
   Co-Cr-FeMn-Ni high-entropy alloys (HEAs). Firstly, one face-centered
   cubic (fcc) quinary Co-Cr-Fe-Mn-Ni diffusion multiple at 1373 K was
   carefully prepared by means of the hot-pressing technique. Based on the
   composition profiles measured by the field emission electron probe micro
   analysis (FE-EPMA), the composition-dependent interdiffusivity matrices
   in quinary Co-Cr-Fe-Mn-Ni system at 1373 K were then efficiently
   determined using the pragmatic numerical inverse method. The determined
   interdiffusivities show good agreement with the limited results
   available in the literature. Moreover, the further comparison with the
   interdiffusivities in the lower-order systems indicates the sluggish
   diffusion effect in Co-Cr-Fe-Mn-Ni HEAs, which is however not observed
   in tracer diffusivities. In order for the convenience in further
   analysis, a generalized transformation relation among interdiffusivities
   with different dependent components in multicomponent systems was
   finally derived.

AB The conventional way to form a multicomponent alloy requires mixing
   individual elements in a single step. Phase formation, therefore, is
   governed by inherent thermodynamic and kinetic factors of the system. We
   propose here a new approach for multicomponent alloy synthesis, which
   involves step by step addition of constituent elements. In the present
   work, this is illustrated through the formation of nanocrystalline
   equiatomic AlCoCrFeNi by mechanical alloying. For example, first, binary
   CoNi is formed by milling elemental Co and Ni powders. In the subsequent
   steps, Fe, Cr and Al are added to form ternary (CoNiFe), quaternary
   (CoNiFeCr) and quinary (CoNiFeCrAl) alloy, respectively.
   Three different classes of binaries have been selected as initial
   phases, namely, B2 (AlNi, AlCo and AlFe), BCC (FeCr) and FCC (CoNi and
   FeNi). Remaining constituent elements are added step-wise in varying
   sequences and equiatomic AlCoCrFeNi is obtained in the concluding step.
   The final AlCoCrFeNi alloy at the end of each sequence has varied
   fractions of BCC and FCC phases. For instance, AlNi + Co + Fe+ Cr
   sequence is single phase BCC, whereas the sequence FeNi+ Co+ Cr+ Al
   results in a mixture of BCC (75%) and FCC (25%) phases. The extent to
   which a particular element stabilizes a structure (BCC/B2/FCC) has also
   been elucidated.

AB Supported bimetallic nanocomposites are promising in photocatalysis due
   to the multi-component interaction between metals and between metals and
   carriers. By an in situ reduction method, a series of monometallic (
   Au@CeO2 and Cu@CeO2) and bimetallic catalysts ( Au8Cu2@CeO2, Au5Cu5@CeO2
   and Au1Cu9@CeO2) are obtained, with a metallic core and a CeO2 shell
   structure. The in situ reduction method developed in this work is a
   one-step strategy to obtain supported multi-component nanomaterials with
   a core-shell structure. Photo-assisted oxidation of benzyl alcohol to
   benzaldehyde was performed over the above samples, and the reactivity
   presented a parabolic plot with the increase of Cu content, reaching the
   summit for Au1Cu9@CeO2. Inpouring of Cu enlarged the specific surface
   area and generated more oxygen vacancies, which are significant for
   improving the photocatalytic performance. The intimate correlation
   between the reactivity and the concentration of the oxygen vacancies
   provides that the surface of the CeO2 support with a large number of
   oxygen vacancies serves as the active site for aerobic oxidation.
   Accordingly, a mechanism is proposed for the photocatalytic efficiency
   enhancement as the function of the Cu concentration. Particularly, the
   catalyst Au1Cu9@CeO2 containing quite a low amount of Au species
   demonstrated the best catalytic activity and high selectivity and
   stability, which is strongly desired for cost-effective catalysts.

   their structural fate, multicomponent metal-oxide nanoparticles
   consisting of combinations of Co, Ni, and Cu were synthesized by using

   correlated electron microscopy. These studies revealed that the
   miscibility, ratio of the metallic components, and the synthesis
   temperature determine the crystal structure and architecture of the
   nanoparticles. A Co-Ni-O system forms a rock salt structure largely
   owing to the miscibility of CoO and NiO, while Cu-Ni-O, which has large
   miscibility gaps, forms either homogeneous oxides, heterojunctions, or
   alloys depending on the annealing temperature and composition. Moreover,
   a higher-ordered structure, Co-Ni-Cu-O, was found to follow the behavior
   of lower ordered systems.

AB Metal nanoparticles (NPs) are of interest for applications in catalysis,
   electronics, chemical sensing, and more. Their utility is dictated by
   their composition and physical parameters such as particle size,
   particle shape, and overall architecture (e. g., hollow vs. solid).
   Interestingly, the addition of a second metal to create bimetallic NPs
   adds multifunctionality, with new emergent properties common. However,
   synthesizing structurally defined bimetallic NPs remains a great
   challenge. One synthetic pathway to architecturally controlled
   bimetallic NPs is seed-mediated co-reduction (SMCR) in which two metal
   precursors are simultaneously co-reduced to deposit metal onto
   shape-controlled metal seeds, which direct the overgrowth. Previously
   demonstrated in a Au-Pd system, here SMCR is applied to a system with a
   larger lattice mismatch between the depositing metals: Pd and Cu (7%
   mismatch for Pd-Cu vs. 4% for Au-Pd). Through manipulation of precursor
   reduction kinetics, the morphology and bimetallic distribution of the
   resultant NPs can be tuned to achieve eight-branched Pd-Cu
   heterostructures with Cu localized at the tips of the Pd nanocubes as
   well as branched Pd-Cu alloyed nanostructures and polyhedra.
   Significantly, the symmetry of the seeds can be transferred to the final
   nanostructures. This study expands our understanding of SMCR as a route
   to structurally defined bimetallic nanostructures and the synthesis of
   multicomponent nanomaterials more generally.

AB The surface structure and composition of a multi-component catalyst are
   critical factors in determining its catalytic performance. The surface
   composition can depend on the local pressure of the reacting species,
   leading to the possibility that the flow through a nanoporous catalyst
   can affect its structure and reactivity. Here, we explore this
   possibility for oxidation reactions on nanoporous gold, an AgAu
   bimetallic catalyst. We use microscopy and digital reconstruction to
   obtain the morphology of a two-dimensional slice of a nanoporous gold
   sample. Using lattice Boltzmann fluid dynamics simulations along with
   thermodynamic models based on first-principles total-energy
   calculations, we show that some sections of this sample have low local
   O-2 partial pressures when exposed to reaction conditions, which leads
   to a pure Au surface in these regions, instead of the active bimetallic
   AgAu phase. We also explore the effect of temperature on the surface
   structure and find that moderate temperatures (approximate to 300-450 K)
   should result in the highest intrinsic catalytic performance, in
   apparent agreement with experimental results. Published by AIP

   the single-phase supersaturated grains prepared in Ni-Fe-Pb alloy melt
   at different under-coolings was investigated by performing isothermal
   annealings at T = 400 degrees C-800 degrees C. Combining the
   multicomponent Gibbs adsorption equation and Guttmann's grain boundary
   segregation model, an empirical relation for isothermal grain growth was
   derived. By application of the model to grain growth in Ni-Fe-Pb,
   Fe-Cr-Zr and Fe-Ni-Zr alloys, it was predicted that driving grain
   boundary energy to zero is possible in alloys due to the co-segregation
   induced by the interactive effect between the solutes Fe/Pb, Zr/Ni and
   Zr/Cr. A non-linear relationship rather than a simple linear relation
   between 1/D* (D* the metastable equilibrium grain size) and ln(T) was
   predicted due to the interactive effect.

AB Recently, many researchers have studied on the variety of alloys and
   tempt to develop wear resistant materials. Multi-component white cast
   iron has been reported to exhibit good erosive wear and abrasive wear
   resistance. Niobium (Nb) is also one of the carbide-forming elements in
   the same manner as vanadium (V), but not much is known about the effect
   on the wear resistance by Nb addition into the cast irons. Therefore,
   multi-component white cast irons with about 2 mass% carbon (C) and about
   5 mass% chromium (Cr), molybdenum (Mo), tungsten (W) and V or Nb with 0,
   5 mass% cobalt (Co) were prepared as the experimental materials in this
   study.
   As results, the amount of wear loss of the multi-component white cast
   irons containing Nb is less compared to that of the multi-component
   white cast irons containing V, showing good abrasive wear resistance.
   Especially, material 5Nb-5Co showed the best abrasive wear resistance.
   Area ratio of eutectic carbides and secondary carbides in any of the
   specimens were at the same level. However, eutectic MC carbide of
   multi-component cast iron containing Nb was larger as compared to that
   of multi-component cast iron containing V, showing higher resistance to
   the contact with the abrasive grains. Therefore, it was suggested that

AB The phase stability of the fcc solid solution in the Co-Cr-Fe-Mn-Ni
   system was theoretically and experimentally investigated. Using the
   Calphad approach and a new database (TCHEA1) devoted to high entropy
   alloys (HEA), the stable phases of 10 626 compositions could be
   calculated, depending on the temperature. 11 alloys were also processed
   and characterized. The comparison between calculations and experimental
   results indicates that the fcc solid solution is accurately described by
   the TCHEA1 database but, the a phase is more stable than the calculation
   predictions. It was shown that the fcc phase is stable over a wide range
   of compositions, which was completely described. Now it is possible to
   choose a priori a composition which will form a solid solution within
   the Co-Cr-Fe-Mn-Ni system. Finally, it was proven that Cr and Mn
   destabilize the fcc solid solution, unlike Ni and Co. (C) 2017 Acta

AB Thermal stability and crystallization of three multicomponent glassy
   alloys, Al86Y7Ni5Co1Fe0.5Pd0.5, Al85Y8Ni5Co1Fe0.5Pd0.5 and
   Al84Y9Ni4Co1.5Fe0.5Pd1, were examined to assess the ability to form the
   mixture of amorphous (am) and fcc-aluminum (alpha-Al) phases. On
   heating, the glass transition into the supercooled liquid is shown by
   the 85Al and 84Al glasses. The crystallization sequences are [am] ->[am
   + alpha-Al] -> [alpha-Al + compounds] for the 86Al and 85Al alloys, and
   [am] -> [am + alpha-Al + cubic AlxMy (M = Y, Ni, Co, Fe, Pd)] -> [am +
   alpha-Al] -> [alpha-Al + Al3Y + Al-9(Co, Ni)(2) + unknown phase] for the
   84Al alloy. The glass transition appears even for the 85Al alloy where
   the primary phase is alpha-Al. The heating-induced reversion from [am +
   alpha-Al + multicomponent AlxMy] to [am + alpha-Al] for the 84Al alloy
   is abnormal, not previously observed in crystallization of glassy
   alloys, and seems to originate from instability of the metastable AlxMy
   compound, in which significant inhomogeneous strain is caused by the
   mixture of solute elements. This novel reversion phenomenon is
   encouraging for obtaining the [am + alpha-Al] mixture over a wide range
   of high temperature effective for the formation of Al-based
   high-strength nanostructured bulk alloys by warm working.

   by milling five- to seven-component equiatomic mixtures of elemental
   powders in a Fritsch (P-7) planetary mill have been characterized by
   differential thermal analysis and X-ray diffraction. The results
   demonstrate that, if the starting mixture contains Al, the BCC solid
   solution formed as a result of the milling undergoes heating-induced
   CsCl-type ordering (beta-phase). If not only Al but also Ti are present
   in the starting mixture, further heating causes the beta-phase to
   convert to an L2(1) phase with the composition (Ni, Co) TiAl. The
   elements Cr and Fe form a tetragonal sigma-phase. The presence of Nb in
   the starting mixture suppresses the formation of the sigma-phase and
   favors the formation of a hexagonal Laves phase of complex composition:
   (Fe, Co) CrNb.

AB High entropy alloys are multicomponent alloys that have at least five
   different principal elements as alloying elements. Each of these
   elements has an atomic percentage between 5% and 35%. Typically, they
   form body-centered cubic (bcc) or face-centered cubic (fcc) structure
   and are known to possess excellent mechanical properties, corrosion
   resistance, excellent electric and magnetic properties. Owing to their
   excellent corrosion and wear resistance, researchers are focusing on
   employing these materials as coatings. In this research, Laser Metal
   Deposition (LMD) was used to fabricate AlxCoFeNiCu1-x (x = 0.25, 0.5,
   0.75) high entropy alloys from elemental powder based feedstocks. Thin
   wall claddings fabricated via LMD were characterized by a variety of
   techniques. Data from X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and Electron Back Scatter
   Diffraction (EBSD) suggested that with increase in Al content and
   decrease in Cu content, a change in crystal structure from a
   predominantly fcc to a combined fcc and bcc structure can be observed.
   The microstructure of the material was observed to be columnar
   dendritic. Data from standard less EDS analysis showed that the
   dendritic phase was Fe and Co enriched while the matrix was Cu and Al
   enriched in all the considered high entropy alloy fabrications. The
   Vickers hardness data was used to estimate the mechanical properties of
   these deposits. Results also showed that with the increase in aluminum
   content, AlxCoFeNiCu1-x displayed higher hardness. The high hardness
   values imply potential applications in wear resistant coatings.

   using the following quadratic formalism based on regular solution model:

   thermal stability, mechanical properties and corrosion behavior for (Fe,
   Co, Ni, Cr)(100-x)Bx (x = 18-26) amorphous alloys in comparison with
   Fe100-xBx amorphous alloys. The as-quenched structure consists of an
   amorphous single phase for the 18 -24% B alloys, and amorphous +
   tetragonal Cr5B3 phases for the 26% B alloy. The broad diffraction peak
   position due to amorphous phase shifts to a higher wave vector side with
   increasing B content for the HE alloys, while that of the Fe-B alloys
   changes to the lower wave vector side, indicating the distinct
   difference in disordered atomic structure between the HE alloys and the
   binary alloys. All the as-spun HEA ribbons exhibit good bending
   ductility in spite of the coexistence with their crystalline phases,
   being different from the brittle nature for the 26% B binary alloy. The
   crystallization temperature (T-x) and Vickers hardness (H-v) increase
   with increasing B content, show maximum values of 803 K and 1130,
   respectively, at 22% B and then decrease to 793 K and 1070, respectively
   at 26% B, being different from the nearly constant T-x and almost linear
   increase in H-v with increasing B content for the Fe100-xBx alloys. The
   corrosion resistance in NaCl, H2SO4 and HCl solutions evaluated by
   potential and anode current density is much better for the HE alloys as
   compared with the Fe-B alloys. Thus, the T-x, H-v, bending ductility and
   corrosion resistance for the HE amorphous alloys containing more than 20
   at% B are much superior to those for the Fe-B amorphous alloys. The
   fully crystallized structure consists of fcc + FeB + Fe2B + Cr5B3 phase
   for the HE 22-26 at% B alloys and bcc-Fe + Fe2B for the Fe-B alloys. The
   significant improvement of the fundamental properties caused by the HE
   component modification is presumably due to the formation of Cr-B pair
   with higher B-rich components. The improved properties in conjunction
   with the change in the disordered structure for the HE amorphous alloys
   provide an opportunity of developing a new functional material by alloy
   design to HE type compositions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Single-phase concentrated solid solution alloys have attracted wide
   interest due to their superior mechanical properties and enhanced
   radiation tolerance, which make them promising candidates for the
   structural applications in next-generation nuclear reactors. However,
   little has been understood about the intrinsic stability of their
   as-synthesized, high-entropy configurations against radiation damage.
   Here we report the element segregation in CrFeCoNi, CrFeCoNiMn, and
   CrFeCoNiPd equiatomic alloys when subjected to 1250 kV electron
   irradiations at 400 degrees C up to a damage level of 1 displacement per
   atom. Cr/Fe/Mn/Pd can deplete and Co/Ni can accumulate at
   radiation-induced dislocation loops, while the actively segregating
   elements are alloy-specific. Moreover, electron-irradiated matrix of
   CrFeCoNiMn and CrFeCoNiPd shows Ll(0) (NiMn)-type ordering decomposition
   and < 001 >-oriented spinodal decomposition between Co/Ni and Pd,
   respectively. These findings are rationalized based on the atomic size
   difference and enthalpy of mixing between the alloying elements, and
   identify a new important requirement to the design of radiation-tolerant
   alloys through modification of the composition. (C) 2016 Acta Materialia

AB Quinary exact equi-atomic MnFeNiCuPt and MnFeNiCuCo alloys were
   investigated to examine their formation of high-entropy alloys (HEAs) by
   focusing on an L1(0) structure from Pettifor map for binary compounds
   with 1: 1 stoichiometry. The MnFeNiCuPt alloy was practically selected
   through computer-assisted alloy design under conditions of <= 20 at%
   noble metals, and the condition that the L1(0) structure appears as
   frequently as possible in the constituent binary equi-atomic
   compositions comprised of 78 elements. MnFeNiCuCo was selected by
   substituting Pt with Co from the MnFeNiCuPt alloy as the second
   candidate. X-ray diffraction and observations by scanning electron
   microscopy (by energy dispersive spectroscopy for composition analysis)
   revealed that as-prepared MnFeNiCuPt and MnFeNiCuCo alloys were formed
   into HEAs with dual fcc structures containing dendrites of similar to 10
   mu m in width. The MnFeNiCuPt and MnFeNiCuCo alloys annealed at 1373 K
   for 43.2 ks and subsequently quenched in water formed single fcc phases
   and dual fcc phases, respectively. The annealed MnFeNiCuPt and
   MnFeNiCuCo alloys were subsequently cooled in a furnace and formed
   single L1(2) ordered phases and dual fcc phases, respectively. These
   phases, experimentally observed in the annealed samples, could be
   partially explained by thermodynamic calculations using Thermo-Calc with
   SSOL4 and SSOL5 databases for solid solutions. The MnFeNiCuPt and
   MnFeNiCuCo alloys exhibit soft magnetism with saturation magnetization
   of 0.23 and 0.43 T, respectively, with coercivity values of similar to 1

AB Equimolar CrMnFeCoNi high entropy alloy (HEA) is one of the most notable
   single phase multi-component alloys up-to-date with promising mechanical
   properties at cryogenic temperatures. However, the study on the
   corrosion behavior of CrMnFeCoNi HEA coating has still been lacking. In
   this paper, HEA coating with a nominal composition of CrMnFeCoNi is
   fabricated by laser surface alloying and studied in detail.
   Microstructure and chemical composition are determined by X-ray
   diffraction (XRD), optical microscope (OM), scanning electron microscope
   (SEM) and energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS). Potentiodynamic
   polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) are used
   to investigate the corrosion behavior. The coating forms a simple FCC
   phase with an identical dendritic structure composed of Fe/Co/Ni-rich
   dendrites and Mn/Ni-rich interdendrites. Both in 3.5 wt.% NaCl solution
   and 0.5 M sulfuric acid the coating exhibits nobler corrosion resistance
   than A36 steel substrate and even lower i(corr) than 304 stainless steel
   (304SS). EIS plots coupled with fitted parameters reveal that a
   spontaneous protective film is formed and developed during immersion in
   0.5 M sulfuric acid. The fitted R-t value reaches its maximum at 24h
   during a 48 h' immersion test, indicating the passive film starts to
   break down after that. EDS analysis conducted on a corroded surface
   immersed in 0.5 M H2SO4 reveals that corrosion starts from Cr-depleted
   interdendrites. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A multicomponent Al84Y9Ni4Co1.5Fe0.5Pd1 alloy was found to keep a mixed
   glassy + Al phases in the relatively large ribbon thickness range up to
   about 200 mu m for the melt-spun ribbon and in the diameter range up to
   about 1100 mu m for the wedge-shaped cone rod prepared by injection
   copper mold casting. The glassy phase in the Al-based alloy has a unique
   crystallization process of glass transition, followed by supercooled
   liquid region, fcc-Al + glass, and then Al + Al3Y + Al-9 (Co, Fe)(2) +
   unknown phase. It is also noticed that the primary precipitation phase
   from supercooled liquid is composed of an Al phase instead of coexistent
   Al + compound phases, being different from the crystallization mode from
   supercooled liquid for ordinary Al-based glassy alloys. In addition, it
   is noticed that the mixed Al and glassy phases are extended in a wide
   heating temperature range of 588-703 K, which is favorable for the
   development of high-strength nanostructure Al-based bulk alloys obtained
   by warm extrusion of mixed Al + amorphous phases. The Vickers hardness
   is about 415 for the glassy phase and increases significantly to about
   580 for the mixed Al and glassy phases. The knowledge of forming Al +
   glassy phases with high hardness in the wide solidification and
   annealing conditions through high stability up to complete
   crystallization for the multicomponent alloy is promising for future
   development of a high-strength Al-based bulk alloy.

   component decoupling at the T-l is observed, the ratio between Zr and Co
   self-diffusion coefficients is smaller than two in the alloys with fewer
   components. The difference in the degree of decoupling compared to Vit4
   can be explained in terms of different T(l)s. Moreover, owing to the
   high accuracy of the simultaneous tracer diffusion technique, we are
   able to resolve a small but notable composition dependence of the ratio
   D-co/D-zr, which decreases with increasing Zr content for all glass
   forming alloys reported here. In contrast to a hard sphere (HS)-like
   mixture, where decoupling is controlled only by atomic sizes, this
   indicates a coupling of the Co/Ni and Zr diffusion, due to the strong
   chemical affinity between the diffusing components. Our results are in
   very good agreement with recent simulations in Zr64Ni36 based on mode
   coupling theory (MCT).

AB There have been many interesting studies on high-entropy alloys (HEAs),
   also known as multi-component (MC) alloys (MCAs), in recent years. MC
   metallic-glasses (MGs) have shown the potential to express the
   advantages of MCAs and MGs in tandem. Amorphous phase formation rules
   are a crucial issue in the HEA and MCA field. For equal or near-equal
   atomic ratio alloys, mixed-entropy among the elements has a significant
   effect on the phase formation. This paper focuses on HEA amorphous phase
   formation rules. In the first two sections, the recent progress in
   amorphous phase formation in HEAs and MCAs is reviewed, including the
   effective factors and correlative parameters related to amorphous phase
   formation. In the third section, novel MCMGs including high-entropy (HE)
   bulk-metallic-glass (HE-BMG) and MCMG films developed in recent decades
   are summarized, and the giant-magnetic-impedance (GMI) effect of MC
   amorphous fibers is discussed.

AB During direct laser deposition process, rapid melting-solidification and
   addition of multicomponent powder lead to complex transport phenomena in
   the melt pool. The thermal behavior and mass transport significantly
   affect the solidified microstructure and properties of fabricated layer.
   In this paper, an improved 3D numerical model is proposed to simulate
   the heat transfer, fluid flow, solidification and multicomponent mass
   transport in direct laser deposition of Co-base alloy on steel. The
   solidification characteristics, including temperature gradient (G),
   solidification growth rate (R) and cooing rate (G x R), can be obtained
   by transient thermal distribution to predict the morphology and scale of
   the solidification microstructure. Multicomponent transport equation
   based on a mixture-averaged approach is combined with other conservation
   equations. The calculated melt pool geometry and the composition
   profiles of iron (Fe), carbon (C), cobalt (Co) and chromium (Cr) are
   compared with the experimental results. The results show that in the
   initial stage of direct laser deposition, the rapidly mixture of
   substrate material and added material occur in the melt pool and conduct
   plays an important role in heat transfer due to the low Peclet number.
   As the melt pool is developed, the heat and mass transfer in the melt
   pool are dominated by strong Marangoni convection. An unmixed zone is
   observed near the bottom of melt pool where the convection is
   frictionally dissipated due to the presence of solidified dendrites.
   Since the G/R decreases and G x R increases from the bottom to the top
   of the solidified track, the morphology of the microstructure changes
   from planar front to columnar dendrites to equiaxed dendrites and the
   grain size decreases. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Modern optoelectronic devices are usually based on multicomponent

   chemically different components cause energy fluctuations experienced by
   charge carriers. So far the theory for compositional disorder has been
   developed for compounds, in which atoms of only two chemically different
   types can occupy sites in a given sublattice. We extend the theoretical
   consideration for multi-compound alloys containing more than two
   chemically different semiconductor species occupying sites in the same
   sublattice. Different spatial dimensionalities are considered. A
   comparison between theoretical predictions and experimental data can be
   used to reveal compositional dependencies of such material parameters as
   the effective mass. (C) 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB The present investigation reports phase and microstructure evolution
   during solidification of novel Ni-rich Ni-Ti-based alloys, Ni60Ti40,
   Ni50Cu10Ti40, Ni48Cu10Co2Ti40, and Ni48Cu10Co2Ti38Ta2 during suction
   casting. The design philosophy of the multicomponent alloys involves
   judicious selection of alloying elements such as Cu, Co, and Ta in the
   near Ni60Ti40 eutectic alloy by replacing both Ni and Ti so that phase
   mixture in the microstructure remains the same from the binary to
   quinary alloy. The basic objective is to study the effect of addition of
   Cu, Co, and Ta on the phase evolution and transformation in the Ni-rich
   Ni-Ti-based alloys. The detailed electron microscopic studies on these
   suction cast alloys reveal the presence of ultrafine eutectic lamellae
   between NiTi and Ni3Ti phases along with dendritic NiTi and Ti2Ni
   phases. It has also been observed that in the binary (Ni60Ti40) alloy,
   the ordered NiTi (B2) phase transforms to trigonal (R) phase followed by
   NiTi martensitic phase (M-phase), i.e., B2 -> R-phase -> M-phase during
   solid-state cooling. However, the addition of alloying elements such as
   Cu, Co to the binary (Ni60Ti40) alloy suppresses the martensitic
   transformation of the ordered NiTi (B2) dendrite. Thus, in the ternary
   and quaternary alloys, the ordered NiTi (B2) phase is transformed to
   only trigonal (R) phase, i.e., B2 -> R-phase. The secondary precipitate
   of Ti2Ni has been observed in all of the studied alloys. Interestingly,
   Ni48Cu10Co2Ti38Ta2 quinary alloy shows the disordered nature of NiTi
   dendrites. The experimentally observed solidification path is in good
   agreement with Gulliver-Scheil simulated path for binary alloy, whereas
   simulated solidification path deviates from the experimental results in
   case of ternary, quaternary, and quinary alloys.

   alloy alloyed with dilute amounts of Ti and Al,
   (FeCoNiCr)(100-x-y)TixAly (where x = 1-3, y = 4-9 at.%). It was found
   that, upon aging, nano-sized L1(2)-Ni-3(Ti, Al) particles are formed
   within grains, whilst L2(1)-(Ni, Co)(2)TiAl Heusler particles are formed
   mainly along grain boundaries. The relative thermal stability of the two
   phases were studied at different aging temperatures (700-900 degrees C)
   with various durations of time (up to 48 h) and the results were
   directly compared with Thermo-talc calculations. Tensile tests were also
   conducted on alloys aged under different conditions. The measured
   properties, including strength and ductility, were correlated with the
   microstructure of aged (FeCoNiCr)(100-x-y)TixAly alloys, with particular
   attention on the distribution and morphology of the two kinds of
   precipitate. Whereas both phases could contribute to the strengthening
   of the alloys via either Orowan bowing or particle shearing mechanism,
   the brittle (Ni, Co)(2)TiAl Heusler phase was found to mainly affect the
   tensile plasticity. A simple composite model was proposed to describe
   the plastic strain of alloys. Based on observed microstructure and its
   corresponding mechanical performance, the alloy with the composition of
   (FeCoNiCr)(94)Ti2Al4, when aged between 700 and 800 degrees C, gives the
   best balanced strength/ductility properties. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB The emergence of synergistic effects in multicomponent systems opens new
   opportunities to design improved catalysts for the electrochemical CO2
   reduction reaction (eCO(2)RR). Targeting the selective formation of CO,
   we have evaluated a comprehensive set of silver-indium electrocatalysts
   with different architectures, ranging from bulk intermetallic compounds
   to Ag nanoparticles supported on In2O3 and In(OH)3. This approach
   allowed the design of a supported electrocatalyst with maximized
   performance. Despite very different bulk compositions, XPS analyses on
   Ag-In alloy electrodes revealed a near-surface indium enrichment,
   leading to a comparatively poor electrocatalytic performance. In
   contrast, the presence of oxidized indium deposits on the surface of
   bulk silver had a positive effect on the selectivity for CO at moderate
   overpotential. Based on these findings, we studied the interactions
   between silver and oxidic indium phases by preparing sets of In203- and
   In(OH)(3)-supported Ag catalysts, which were characterized with XRD, N-2
   sorption, H-2-TPR, CO2-TPD, STEM and EDX. With respect to the pristine
   supports and to similarly prepared Ag catalysts on carbon black, these
   nanostructured systems exhibited an enhanced current efficiency for CO
   at moderate overpotential, evidencing a synergistic effect between the
   metal nanoparticles and the supports. This effect was particularly
   marked at higher Ag loadings and with In(OH)3 as support which, unlike
   In203, was stable against reduction under eCO(2)RR conditions. As a
   final step, the selectivity enhancement achieved in Agiln(OH)3 was
   combined with the known activity-promoting role of P25 TiO2 by
   depositing Ag on a composite support. The Ag/In(OH)(3)-TiO2 catalyst
   showed concurrent gains in selectivity and activity for CO. The findings
   highlight the potential of stable metal (hydr)oxide supports to act as
   promoters in the eCO(2)RR and the importance of the structural
   configuration in multicomponent electrocatalysts. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

   alloys, where x takes values between 2 and 25, were processed so as to
   reach the stable state and then characterized. A unique fcc
   solid-solution is formed for a wide range composition, spanning from 0
   to 90 at.% of Cr, Mn, Fe and Co. When the sum of Cr, Fe, Mn and Co
   contents is larger than 90 at.%, the system demixes into two quaternary
   phases. The existing thermodynamics models are unable to predict the
   range of existence of the solid-solution for the studied alloys. No
   microstructural transition between HEA and conventional diluted alloys
   is observed. The maximization of configurational entropy appears to be
   neither a sufficient nor a necessary condition to form a HEA.
   Consequently a new definition for HEA is needed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The C-Co-Mo and C-Mo-Ni systems were assessed by means of the CALPHAD
   (CALculation of PHAse Diagram) approach. All of the experimental phase
   diagram and thermodynamic data available from the literature were
   critically reviewed. The liquid was modeled as substitutional solution
   phase, while the solid solution phases including (gamma Co), (Ni), (Mo),
   MoC and Mo2C were described by sublattice model. The M6C and M12C
   ternary carbides were considered as linear and stoichiometric compounds,
   respectively. The modeling of C-Co-Mo and C-Mo-Ni systems covers the
   whole composition and temperature ranges. A set of self-consistent
   thermodynamic parameters for the C-Co-Mo and C-Mo-Ni systems was finally
   obtained. Comprehensive comparisons between the calculated and measured
   phase diagram and thermodynamic data show that the experimental
   information is satisfactorily accounted for by the present thermodynamic
   description. The liquidus projection and reaction scheme of the C-Co-Mo
   and C-Mo-Ni systems were also generated by using the present

AB HSLA-115 is a novel high-strength low-alloy structural steel derived
   from martensitic Cu-bearing HSLA-100. HSLA-100 is typically used in
   conditions with overaged Cu precipitates, to obtain acceptable impact
   toughness and ductility. Present work on HSLA-115 demonstrates that
   incorporating sub-nanometric-sized M2C carbides along with Cu
   precipitates produces higher strength steels that still meet impact
   toughness and ductility requirements. Isothermal aging at 823 K (550 A
   degrees C) precipitates M2C carbides co-located with the Cu precipitates
   and distributed heterogeneously at lath boundaries and dislocations. 3D
   atom-probe tomography is used to characterize the evolution of these
   precipitates at 823 K (550 A degrees C) in terms of mean radii, number
   densities, and volume fractions. These results are correlated with
   microhardness, impact toughness, and tensile strength. The optimum
   combination of mechanical properties, 972 MPa yield strength, 24.8 pct
   elongation to failure, and 188.0 J impact toughness at 255 K (-18 A
   degrees C), is attained after 3-hour aging at 823 K (550 A degrees C).
   Strengthening by M2C precipitates offsets the softening due to overaging
   of Cu precipitates and tempering of martensitic matrix. It is shown that
   this extended yield strength plateau can be used as a design principle
   to optimize strength and toughness at the same time.

AB Pillared clay based composites containing transition metals and a

   Cu2+ or Co2+), were prepared to study selectivity and capacity toward
   single and multiple -component adsorption of bisphenol A (BPA) and
   2,4-diclorophenol (DCP) from water. Tests were also performed to account
   for the presence of natural organic matter in the form of humic acid
   (HA). Equilibrium adsorption capacities for single components increased
   as follows: NaBt < Al-NaBt < AlOr-NaBt < MAIOr-NaBt. The observed
   equilibrium loadings were ca. 5 and 3 mg g(-1) for BPA and DCP,
   respectively, at neutral pH conditions and ambient temperature,
   representing an ordered of magnitude increase over the unmodified
   pillared clay capacities. Inclusion of the transition metal brought an
   increase of nearly two -fold in adsorption capacity over the materials
   modified only with surfactant. The MAIOr-NaBt adsorbents displayed
   remarkable selectivity for BPA. Multi -component fixed -bed tests,
   however, revealed competition between the adsorbates, with the exception
   of the CuAlOr-NaBt beds. Inclusion of HA, surprisingly, enhanced the
   phenols adsorption capacity. Preliminary regeneration tests suggested
   that the adsorbent capacity can be recovered via thermal treatment or by
   washing with alkaline solutions. The former strategy, however, requires
   surfactant replenishment. More complex schemes would be needed to deal

   properties of the Laves phase RCo2-type compounds is studied. Main
   attention is devoted to the studies of the magnetostructural phase

   composition. Multicomponent alloys Tb-x(Dy0.5Ho0.5)(1-x)Co-2 and
   Tb-x(Dy0.5Ho0.5)(1-x)Co1.75Al0.25 were prepared with the use of high
   purity metals. Majority of the Tb-x(Dy0.5Ho0.5)(1-x)Co-2 alloys exhibit
   magnetic transitions of the first-order type and a large magnetocaloric
   effect. The substitution of Al for Co in Tb-x(Dy0.5Ho0.5)(1-x)Co-2
   increases the Curie temperature (TC) but changes the transition type
   from first-to the second-order. The discussion of the physical
   mechanisms behind the observed phenomena is given on the basis of the
   first principles electronic-structure calculations taking into account
   both the atomic disorder and the magnetic disorder effects at finite

AB The effects of element addition, Co, Cu, and Ag on the microstructure,
   thermal property and magnetic properties of mechanical alloyed FeSiBAlNi
   high entropy alloys (HEAs, base alloy) have been investigated in depth
   in the present work. The FeSiBAlNi (Co, Cu, Ag) amorphous HEAs have been
   successfully fabricated by mechanical alloying process. The results
   reveal that Co and Cu additions obviously shorten the formation time of
   fully amorphous phase, therefore, leading to enhanced glass forming
   ability of the base alloy. The final milling product of FeSiBAlNiAg
   consists of amorphous phase and nanocrystals with face-centered cubic
   (FCC) structure. In addition, Co addition obviously improves the thermal
   stability of the base alloy, while Cu and Ag additions present the
   detrimental effects. Moreover, the as-milled HEAs exhibit the semi-hard
   magnetic property. However, the saturation magnetization (M-s) values
   become decreased with element additions. It suggests that the
   coexistence of FCC and body-centered cubic (BCC) phase gives rise to a
   higher M-s than a single amorphous phase or mixture of amorphous and FCC
   phases. Additionally, the phase formation mechanisms of amorphous and
   solid solution phases, as well as the correlation between the
   microstructure and magnetic properties have been discussed, which can be
   beneficial to the design of novel alloy systems. (C) 2016 The Society of

AB High-entropy alloys (HEAs) are presently of great research interest in
   materials science and engineering. Unlike conventional alloys, which
   contain one and rarely two base elements, HEAs comprise multiple
   principal elements, with the possible number of HEA compositions
   extending considerably more than conventional alloys. With the advent of
   HEAs, fundamental issues that challenge the proposed theories, models,
   and methods for conventional alloys also emerge. Here, we provide a
   critical review of the recent studies aiming to address the fundamental
   issues related to phase formation in HEAs. In addition, novel properties
   of HEAs are also discussed, such as their excellent specific strength,
   superior mechanical performance at high temperatures, exceptional
   ductility and fracture toughness at cryogenic temperatures,
   superparamagnetism, and superconductivity. Due to their considerable
   structural and functional potential as well as richness of design, HEAs
   are promising candidates for new applications, which warrants further
   studies.

AB Electrocatalysts are crucial materials for applications of direct
   methanol fuel cells (DMFCs). Here, we have designed a novel
   multi-component nanoporous alloy electrocatalyst, and further modified
   its electrocatalytic performance through a controllable dealloying
   strategy. The quaternary nanoporous PtPdCuAl (np-PtPdCuAl) alloys have
   been successfully fabricated by dealloying mechanically alloyed AlCuPdPt
   precursor. Well control of one-step or two-step dealloying allows to
   tune the compositions and electrocatalytic activities of the np-PtPdCuAl
   alloys (designated as T1-T6 alloys). The np-PtPdCuAl alloys obtained
   through two-step dealloying show much enhanced electrocatalytic
   properties towards methanol electro-oxidation reaction (MOR) and oxygen
   reduction reaction (ORR) in comparison to the commercial benchmark Pt/C
   catalyst. Moreover, the np-PtPdCuAl alloy with the best MOR and ORR
   properties as well as excellent CO tolerance could be obtained by
   firstly dealloying in the 2 M NaOH solution and then in the 1 M HNO3
   solution (T3 alloy). This facile synthesis and easy control route is
   promising for the development of high performance electrocatalysts in
   DMFCs, and can be extended to fabricate other multi-component Pt-based
   catalysts with enhanced activities. (C) 2016 Hydrogen Energy

AB This article, by the example of 3 superalloys, discusses the principles
   that should be followed in designing new multicomponent alloys.
   Experimentally, it was shown that these principles are as follows: 1.
   Chemical interaction between dissimilar atoms exist always, in all
   alloys and at any temperature of heating; 2. Alloys have a not
   previously known property of changing the sign of the chemical
   interaction at a change of the temperature, subsequently leading to a
   change in the type of microstructures; 3. A model of pairwise
   interaction is realized in multicomponent alloys, according to which the
   chemical interaction between dissimilar atoms (which exists within each
   of the diffusion couples of a multi component alloy), occurs similarly
   to the chemical interaction in a corresponding binary alloy. Using this
   approach, it has been found experimentally that the process of
   partitioning of a multicomponent alloy into diffusion couples takes
   place in the liquid solution. It has been found that the remarkable
   properties of alloys of the Hastelloy and Tribaloy types are manifested
   by the fact that the tendency to phase separation takes place in the
   majority of their diffusion couples. It is shown that the formation of
   multicomponent chemical compounds (Laves phases) under conditions where
   in alloys there is a tendency to phase separation is impossible. (C)

AB Multicomponent Co20Cu20Fe20Ni20Ti20 eutectic high entropy alloy (HEA),
   processed by vacuum arc melting cum suction casting technique was
   studied. The microstructure of this eutectic HEA consists bcc (beta) and
   fcc (alpha(2)) solid solution dendritic phases and eutectics (fcc
   (alpha(1)) plus Ti-2(Ni, Co)-type Laves phase). Serrations in the flow
   behaviour are attributed to multi substitutional solutes in the
   multi-phase microstructure. Based on the detailed analysis of mechanical
   data together with deformed microstructural characterization, the
   optimum thermo-mechanical processing conditions for hot working are
   identified as T=930-990 degrees C (1203-1263 K) and strain rate range of

   multicomponent mixtures of Cr, Fe, Co, Ni, Al, Ti, Mo, and Nb metals in
   various combinations, we have synthesized powder alloys with different
   phase compositions: amorphous phase (AP), AP + BCC phase, AP + BCC phase
   + MO, and FCC + BCC phases. The FCC phase has been shown to be a
   Ni-based solid solution. The presence of aluminum in a starting mixture
   helps to stabilize the BCC phase owing to the formation of a disordered
   B2 phase. Al dissolves in both the BCC and FCC solid solutions,
   increasing their lattice parameters. In Al-free starting mixtures, Cr is
   responsible for the formation of the BCC solid solution. The formation
   of an AP during milling of multicomponent mixtures is favored by the
   presence of transition metals with a large atomic radius: Ti, Mo, and
   Nb.

AB Biomass is available from many sources or can be mass-produced.
   Moreover, biomass has a high energy-generation potential, produces less
   toxic emissions than some other fuels, is mostly carbon neutrality, and
   burns easily. Biomass has been widely utilized as a raw material in
   thermal chemical conversion, replacing coal and oil, including power
   generation. Biomass firing and co-firing in pulverized coal boilers,
   fluidized bed boilers, and grate furnaces or stokerfed boilers have been
   developed around the world because of the worsening environmental
   problems and developing energy crisis. However, many issues hinder the
   efficient and clean utilization of biomass in energy applications. They
   include preparation, firing and co-firing, and ash-related issues during
   and after combustion. In particular, ash-related issues, including
   alkali-induced slagging, silicate melt-induced slagging (ash fusion),
   agglomeration, corrosion, and ash utilization, are among the most
   challenging problems. The current review provides a summary of knowledge
   and research developments concerning these ash-related issues. It also
   gives an in-depth analysis and discussion on the formation mechanisms,
   urgent requirements, and potential countermeasures including the use of
   additives, co-firing, leaching, and alloying.
   Alkali species, particularly alkali chlorides and sulfates, cause
   alkali-induced slagging during biomass combustion. Thus, the mechanisms
   of generation, transformation, and sequestration of alkali species and
   the formation and growth of alkali-induced slagging, formed as an
   alternating overlapping multilayered structure, are discussed in detail.
   For silicate melt-induced slagging (ash fusion), the evolutions of
   chemical composition of both the elements and minerals in the ash during
   combustion and existing problems in testing are overviewed. Pseudo-4D
   phase diagrams of (Ma(2)o)-MaeO-P2O5-Al2O3 and (Ma(2)O)MaeO-SiO2-Al2O3
   are proposed as effective tools to predict ash fusion characteristics
   and the properties of melt-induced slagging. Concerning agglomeration
   that typically occurs in fluidized bed furnaces, meltinduced and
   coating-induced agglomeration and coating-forming mechanisms are
   highlighted. Concerning corrosion, seven corrosion mechanisms associated
   with Cl-2, gaseous, solid/deposited, and molten alkali chlorides, molten
   alkali sulfates and carbonates, and the sulfation/silication of alkali
   chlorides are comprehensively reviewed. The effects of alloying, salt
   state (solid, molten, or gaseous), combustion atmosphere, and
   temperature are also discussed systematically. For ash utilization,
   potential approaches to the use of fly ash, bottom ash, and biomass/coal
   co-fired ash as construction and agricultural materials are explored.
   Several criteria or evaluation indexes are introduced for alkali-induced
   slagging and agglomeration, and chemical equilibrium calculation and
   multicomponent phase diagrams of silicate melt-induced slagging and
   agglomeration. Meanwhile, remedies, including the use of additives,
   co-firing, leaching, alloying, and the establishment of regulations, are
   discussed.
   It is suggested that considerable attention should be focused on an
   understanding of the kinetics of alkali chemistry, which is essential
   for the transformation and sequestration of alkali species. A
   combination of heterogeneous chemical kinetics and multiphase
   equilibrium modeling is critical to estimating the speciation,
   saturation levels, and the presence of melt of the ash-forming matter.
   Further practical evaluation and improvement of the existing criterion
   numbers of alkali-induced slagging and agglomeration should be improved.
   The pseudo-4D phase diagrams of (Ma(2)O)-MaeO-P2O5-Al2O3 and
   (Ma(2)O)-MaeO-SiO2Al2O3 should be constructed from the data derived from
   real biomass ashes rather than those of simulated ashes in order to
   provide the capability to predict the properties of silicate
   melt-induced slagging. Apart from Cr, research should be conducted to
   understand the effects of Si, Al, and Co, which exhibit high corrosion
   resistance, and heavy metals such as Zn and Pb, which may form
   low-melting chlorides that accelerate corrosion. Regulations,
   cooperation among biomass-fired power plants and other industries,
   potential technical research, and logistics should be strengthened to
   enable the extensive utilization of biomass ash. Finally, alkali-induced
   slagging, silicate melt-induced slagging, agglomeration, and corrosion
   occur concurrently, and thus, these issues should be investigated
   jointly rather than separately. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   formation of feedstock by mixing Stellite 6 powder with a multicomponent
   binder system. Prepared feedstock was formed by utilizing powder
   injection molding technique. Then the molded samples were subjected to
   the solvent and thermal debinding processes. Different sintering cycles
   were applied to the raw components for the purpose of determining the
   optimum sintering conditions. The densities of the sintered components
   were determined in accordance with the Archimedes' principle. The
   microstructural characterization was performed through scanning electron

   analyses, and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. Hardness measurement and
   tensile test were conducted in order to determine the mechanical
   properties. The results illustrated that the injection molded Stellite 6
   components were composed of fine and equiaxed grains, plenty of carbide
   precipitates exhibiting homogenous distribution throughout the
   microstructure formed at the grain boundaries and thus the mechanical
   properties were considerably high. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   are widely employed as transparent conducting electrodes (TCEs) for
   applications such as touch screens and displays, new nanostructured TCEs
   are of interest for future applications, including emerging transparent
   and flexible electronics. A number of two-dimensional networks of
   nanostructured elements have been reported, including metallic nanowire
   networks consisting of silver nanowires, metallic carbon nanotubes
   (m-CNTs), copper nanowires or gold nanowires, and metallic mesh
   structures. In these single-component systems, it has generally been
   difficult to achieve sheet resistances that are comparable to ITO at a
   given broadband optical transparency. A relatively new third category of
   TCEs consisting of networks of 1D-1D and 1D-2D nanocomposites (such as
   silver nanowires and CNTs, silver nanowires and polycrystalline
   graphene, silver nanowires and reduced graphene oxide) have demonstrated
   TCE performance comparable to, or better than, ITO. In such hybrid
   networks, copercolation between the two components can lead to
   relatively low sheet resistances at nanowire densities corresponding to
   high optical transmittance. This review provides an overview of reported
   hybrid networks, including a comparison of the performance regimes
   achievable with those of ITO and single-component nanostructured
   networks. The performance is compared to that expected from bulk thin
   films and analyzed in terms of the copercolation model. In addition,
   performance characteristics relevant for flexible and transparent
   applications are discussed. The new TCEs are promising, but significant
   work must be done to ensure earth abundance, stability, and reliability
   so that they can eventually replace traditional ITO-based transparent
   conductors.

   expensive alloys. The films were fabricated by the known technique of

   to 106 K/s. Experimental results reveal that the studied films except
   the Al0.5CuFeNi one are multiphase, nanocrystalline, with the structure

   film has only FCC phase. The leading role in determining the type of

AB The topologically close-packed phase formation is heavily influenced by
   the concentrations of Co, Ru, and Cr in Ni-based superaloys. For this
   purpose, we investigate the partitioning behaviour and site preference
   of these additions in the model Ni-Al-X single crystal superalloys by
   atom probe tomography and first-principles calculations. Compared with
   the commercial multicomponent superalloys, Co and Ru still strongly
   partition to the gamma phase, while Cr weakly partitions to the gamma
   phase in the ternary model alloys. Based on the gamma' phase composition
   analyses, Ru and Cr atoms preferentially substitute for the Al
   sublattice sites, whereas Co atoms substitute at both Al and Ni
   sublattice sites in the ordered gamma'-Ni3Al phase. First-principles
   calculations on the substitutional formation energies at 0 K were
   performed to understand the site preference, and the partitioning
   coefficient of additions was given in a quantitative model. The
   partitioning behaviour and site preference of Co, Ru, and Cr by
   theoretical calculations are consistent with the experimental results.

AB High entropy alloys (HEAs) are useful in applications that requir high
   strength, oxidation resistance, and high temperature stability. Research
   on HEAs for magnetocaloric applications focuses on increasing the
   refrigeration constant and controlling the Curie temperature (T-c). Here
   we investigate the effect of metal additions on exchange interaction
   distributions in eqiatomic ferromagnetic alloys of Fe, Co, and Ni. The
   metal additions are (a) noble metals (e.g., Cu, Ag), (b)
   antiferromagnetic transition metals (e.g., Mn), (c) Stoner-enhanced
   transition metals (e.g., Pt), and (d) early transition metals (e.g., Mo)
   that contribute to the virtual bound states. We are able to: 1)
   stabilize a ferromagnetic face-centered cubic. gamma-phase with
   equiatomic compositions in 4-, 5-, and 6-component systems, 2) make
   slight departures from equiatomic compositions to a chosen alloy to
   bring its Tc closer to room temperature, and 3) measure the role of
   alloying on exchange interaction distributions. We present a simple
   model to predict Tc in HEAs using the Bethe-Slater curve and binary
   phase diagrams of alloy constituents. Compared to the rare-earth-based
   magnetocaloric materials, the HEAs investigated here have significantly
   lower costs.

   Effect of the atomic composition is studied on morphology and atomic
   scale structure. Input data are chosen to fit with experimental
   operating conditions of magnetron sputtering deposition process. It is
   observed that the different structures are determined by the chemical
   composition and atomic size mismatch. The simulated results are in good
   agreement with the solidsolution formation rules proposed by Zhang et
   al. [1] for multi-principal component HEAs which based on the two
   parameters delta and Omega, respectively describing describe the
   comprehensive effect of the atomic-size difference in the n-element
   alloy and the effects of enthalpy and entropy of mixing on formation of
   multi-component solid-solutions. When Omega >= 1.1 and delta <= 6.6%,
   the multi-component solid solution phase could form. In contrast, the
   multi-component alloys forming intermetallic compounds and bulk metallic
   glasses (BMG) have larger value of delta and smaller value of Omega. The
   value of Omega for BMG is smaller than that of intermetallic compounds.

   erosion-oxidation resistance at 1173 K. The erosion rate is high in
   V-containing samples without Co due to the occurrence of vanadium oxide
   attack. Whilst, with increasing of Co content, the erosion rate is
   reduced, indicating the addition of Co is an effective counter-measure.
   In Nb-containing samples on the other hand, oxidation is successfully
   controlled by the formation of a composite oxide layer regardless of the
   presence of Co, thereby reducing the erosion losses. (C) 2015 Elsevier

   IV in the periodic table) has been found for the first time. Linear
   dependences of the oxygen solubility on the standard Gibbs energy for
   the oxidation reaction of a liquid metal with gaseous oxygen are found.
   The revealed function of oxygen solubility is of scientific importance
   and allows one to develop a theory of oxygen solutions in liquid metals
   and liquid multicomponent metallic compositions and to calculate the
   energies of mixing of liquid metals with oxygen from Delta G(MO)degrees
   for metal oxidation reactions with allowance for pseudoregular-solution
   model equations. Using the energies of mixing and metal compositions, we
   calculated the equilibrium oxygen concentrations in a metal molten pool
   at the end of oxidation stage of melting 08Kh18N10T steel in an arc
   furnace. This fact indicates practical importance of the found function
   of the oxygen solubility in metals.

AB In this work, the multicomponent Co60Fe5Ni5Ti25B5 (at.%) alloy powders
   were synthesized from commercially available pure elemental powders by
   using a mechanical alloying (MA) process under argon gas atmosphere. The
   changes in structural, morphological, thermal and magnetic properties of
   the processed powders during MA were examined by X-ray diffraction
   (XRD), scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray
   spectroscopy (SEM/EDX), differential thermal analysis (DTA) and
   vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). The results showed that the
   amorphization occurred after 3.5 h of milling, and the amorphous phase
   was stable up to 580 degrees C, where crystallization occurred. The SEM
   observations indicated that different morphologies were obtained during
   the MA stages. In addition, the EDX mapping confirmed the uniform
   distribution of elemental content. Magnetic results indicated that all
   the samples exhibited soft-ferromagnetic behavior. The evolution of the
   saturation magnetization (Ms), the coercivity (Hc) and the squareness
   ratio (Ms/Mr) during milling process were discussed with respect to
   microstructural changes. The influence of the annealing on magnetic
   hysteresis was also studied. The Ms, Hc and Ms/Mr values of about 53.4
   emu/g, 7.6 Oe and 0.01, respectively was obtained after 7 h of milling.

AB Boron refinement is an established method to refine the grain structure
   of titanium alloys. The effect of boron on microstructure of
   multicomponent Ti-Nb-Cu-Co-Al-B alloys was studied. These as-cast alloys
   exhibit a composite-like microstructure consisting of about 92 vol% of
   beta-Ti dendrites surrounded by an ultrafine-structured eutectic
   composed of beta-Ti and B2 TiCo. It was found that significant additions
   (up to 1 at%) of boron do not result in a pronounced refinement of
   microstructure in these alloys. However, noticeable strengthening and
   stiffening effects are observed for the alloys with increasing boron
   concentration. In particular, the yield strength of
   Ti-13.6Nb-6Co-5.1Cu-6.5Al (at%) improves from 1110 +/- 30 MPa to 1200
   +/- 30 MPa with addition of 1 at% of boron. Additionally, increasing

AB This paper presents a multiphysics model for the simulation of solid
   oxide fuel cell operating on biogas without external reforming. The
   model accounts for multicomponent species transport, heterogeneous
   reaction kinetics on Ni cermet anode, H-2 electrochemical oxidation, and
   charge transport in the cermet electrodes and electrolyte. The model
   uses only three adjustable parameters that are fitted against one set of
   experimental data and then kept constant throughout the study. The model
   predicted voltage fluctuations are in excellent agreement with
   experimental measurements reported in the literature. The model also
   reveals that the assumption of H-2 as the only electrochemically active
   species is probably inadequate to explain the behavior of cells
   operating directly on biogas. Thermodynamic analysis is further
   performed to support this claim made based on model predictions. The
   model results demonstrate that the thickness of electrochemically active
   layer is independent of fuel composition under fuel rich conditions,
   however, thins down as the fuel becomes more and more diluted.

AB Real-space partitioning of elements to gamma and gamma' phases in
   Ni-based alloys were simulated at atomic scale using ab initio-based
   multiscale DFT + CEMC approach. The method uses density functional
   theory (DFT) calculations to parameterize cluster expansion (CE) of the
   configuration energy, followed by Monte Carlo (MC) simulations at finite
   temperatures (T). The set of clusters for the CE, which controls the
   accuracy of the expansion, was determined by the method of model
   selection by minimizing cross-validation score S-CV using genetic
   algorithm (GA). The MC algorithm was accelerated through parallelization
   using spatial decomposition allowing simulation of system containing
   millions of atoms. Real space distribution of atoms was obtained for
   Ni-Al, Ni-Al-Ti and Ni-Al-Ti-Co alloys as a function of T and for select
   alloy compositions in gamma + gamma' phase. For ternary Ni-Al-Ti alloys,
   simulation correctly captures preferential partitioning of Ti to gamma'
   whereas interplay of interactions determines the partitioning of Ti and
   Co in quaternary alloys. Simulation results were validated by comparing
   phase boundaries and the volume fraction of gamma' (obtained from real
   space) with thermodynamic calculations using experimental database. The
   approach opens up the route to calculate configuration-dependent
   alloy-specific parameters for higher length scale models for

AB Quasicrystals (QCs) are intermetallic alloys that have excellent
   long-range order but lack translational symmetry in at least one
   dimension. The valence band electronic structure near the Fermi energy
   E-F in such materials is of special interest since it has a direct
   relation to their unusual physical properties. However, the Fermi
   surface (FS) topology as well as the mechanism of QC structure
   stabilization are still under debate. Here we report the first
   observation of the three-dimensional FS and valence band dispersions
   near E-F in decagonal Al70Ni20Co10 (d-AlNiCo) QCs using soft X-ray
   angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. We show that the FS, formed

   by the Johnson-Mehl-Avrami (JMA) equation. During the crystallization

   equation changes little with an average value of 259.9 kJ/mol. The
   Avrami exponent is in the range from 1.81 to 2.04, indicating that the

AB Shape-controlled synthesis of multicomponent metal nanocrystals (NCs)
   bounded by high-index facets (HIFs) is of significant importance in the
   design and synthesis of highly active catalysts. It is a highly
   challenging task to design and synthesize ternary alloy NCs with HIFs
   due to the formidable difficulties in controlling the nucleation/growth
   kinetics of NCs in the presence of three metal precursors with different
   reduction potentials. We report herein, for the first time, the
   preparation of Pt-Ni-Cu alloy NCs by tuning their shape from crossed,
   dendritic, concave nanocubic (CNC) to rough octahedral (ROH) NCs through
   a facile one-pot solvothermal synthesis method. Specifically, the
   crossed and CNC Pt Ni Cu alloy NCs are bounded by high-index flik01
   facets and ROH with rich lattice defects. The electrocatalytic
   activities of these Pt Ni Cu alloy NCs toward methanol and formic acid
   oxidation were tested. It was shown that these Pt Ni Cu alloy NCs
   exhibited enhanced activity and stability compared to commercial Pt
   black and Pt/C catalysts as well as previous Pt Ni and Pt CNCs under the
   same reaction conditions, demonstrating the superior electrocatalytic
   activity of Pt Ni Cu ternary alloys compared to monometal and binary Pt
   Ni NCs. Surprisingly, we have found that the Pt Ni Cu ROH NCs have
   exhibited a higher specific catalytic activity than the crossed and CNC
   Pt Ni Cu alloy NCs with HIFs. The electronic and structure effects have
   been extensively discussed to shed light on the excellent
   electrocatalytic performance of Pt Ni Cu ROH NCs.

   were produced by copper mold casting. In addition to high glass-forming
   ability, the Co-based glassy alloys also exhibit excellent soft-magnetic
   properties, i.e., saturation magnetization of 0.54-0.72 T, low coercive
   field of 0.7-1.4 A/m, and high effective permeability of 18,600-22,400

   relations pertaining to these mechanisms, i.e. evaluation of the

   frequently occurring problems and misconceptions of the thermodynamic
   evaluation are identified and a practical approach with regard to
   kinetic modelling is proposed for combined and unified analysis of the
   thermodynamics of nucleation and growth, based on the fundamental
   thermodynamic equilibrium consideration in a particle-matrix system. A
   computationally efficient method for numerical determination of the

   positive than PtRu, there is a 200 mV negative shift compared to PtC
   (0.67 V vs. SCE). In addition, the half-wave potential and specific

AB (Fe, Co, Ni) rich dendrites nucleate primarily in CoCrFeMoNi and
   CoCrCu0.1FeMoNi alloys, followed by peritetic and eutectic reactions.
   The quasi-peritectic reaction occurs between the primary Mo-rich
   dendrites and liquids in the CoCrCu0.3FeMoNi melts, and transfers to a
   eutectic coupled-growth at the edge of the quasi-peritectic structure.
   Subsequently, eutectic reaction happens in the remnant liquids.
   Liquid-phase separations have occurred in CoCrCuxFeMoNi alloys when x >=
   0.5. Meanwhile, some nanoscale precipitates are obtained in the Cu-rich
   region. Two crystal structures, FCC and BCC, are identified in
   CoCrCuxFeMoNi high entropy alloys. Amazingly, a pretty high plastic
   strain (51.6%) is achieved in CoCrCu0.1FeMoNi alloy when the compressive
   strength reaches to 3012 Mpa. With the increase of Cu content, atomic
   size difference (Delta R) and electro-negativity difference (Delta X)
   decrease while valence electron concentration (VEC), mixing enthalpy
   (Delta H) and mixing entropy (Delta S) increase. Consequently, the
   valence electron concentration (VEC) values range for the formation of
   mixture of FCC and BCC structures can be enlarged to 6.87-835 based on
   the study of this paper. It is the positive enthalpies of mixing that
   causes the liquid-phase separation in CoCrCuxFeMoNi high entropy alloys.

AB Following the Hume Rothery rules, it is a longstanding notion that
   atomic size mismatch induces intrinsic residual strains in a common
   lattice which may cause lattice instability and thus phase transition in
   an alloy. For conventional alloys, such an intrinsic residual strain can
   be derived with the continuum theory of elasticity; however, lack of
   distinction between solvent and solute atoms in recently developed high
   entropy alloys simply defies such an approach. Here, we develop a
   general self-contained geometric model that enables the calculation of
   intrinsic residual strains around different sized elements in a
   multi-component alloy, which links the average lattice constant of the
   alloy to a few critical geometric variables related to the close atomic
   packing in that lattice, such as atomic size, atomic fraction and
   packing density. When applied to glass-forming high entropy alloys and
   bulk metallic glasses, our model unravels that amorphization occurs when
   the root-mean-square (R.M.S.) residual strain rises above similar to
   10%, in good agreement with the Lindemann's lattice instability
   criterion. By comparison, the transition from a single- to multi-phase
   solid solution takes place in crystalline high entropy alloys when the
   R.M.S. residual strain approaches similar to 5%. Our current findings
   provide a quantitative insight into phase stability in multicomponent
   alloys, which should be useful in the design of high entropy alloys with
   desired phases. (C) 2015 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The ability to accurately and safely monitor hydrogen concentration is
   of significant importance for abroad range of energy, defense, aviation,
   and aerospace applications with one of the most notable applications
   being leak detection for hydrogen above the lower explosive limit.
   Optical-based approaches offer significant safety advantages as compared
   to electrical-based sensors and Pd or AuPd-alloys are commonly utilized
   as the functional sensor layer due to a well-known, characteristic, and
   selective interaction with H-2. In this work, optical fiber-based
   sensors comprised of Pd and AuPd alloy nanoparticle incorporated SiO2
   thin films deposited onto unclad multimode silica-based optical fiber
   evanescent wave absorption spectroscopy sensing elements have been
   investigated. Selective, sensitive, and monotonic H-2 sensing responses
   have been demonstrated at levels significantly greater than the lower
   explosive limitin the presence of CO and O-2 near room temperature. A
   tendency for partial oxidation of the noble metal nanoparticles upon
   exposure to oxidizing atmospheres is confirmed directly through X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy, particularly at elevated temperatures.
   Monotonic H-2 sensing responses are also observed at elevated
   temperatures in cases where oxygen is not introduced into the
   atmosphere. However, more complex sensing responses in multi-component
   elevated temperature gas streams containing oxidizing and reducing
   species can be observed which likely result from oxidation and reduction
   of noble metal nanoparticles. These results demonstrate that the
   incorporation of noble metals such as Pd and Pd-alloy nanoparticles into
   inert dielectric matrices such as SiO2 can impart new optical sensing
   functionality potentially useful for H-2 sensing applications. Published

AB We examined the formation, thermal stability, mechanical properties and
   corrosion behavior of a multicomponent Zr55Al10Fe6Co6Ni6Cu6Pd6Ag5 bulk
   glassy alloy, with the aim of clarifying the effect of high-order
   multiplication of the number of components on their properties. The bulk
   glassy alloy rods of 2 and 6 mm in diameter were formed by suction
   casting even at the low total content of typical glass-forming 3-d late
   transition metals like Co, Ni and Cu. The Vickers hardness is different
   in the center region and in the outer surface region. The difference
   seems to reflect the relaxation level of glassy structure. The Young's
   modulus and the compressive fracture strength are nearly the same for
   the base Zr55Al10Ni5Cu30 alloy in spite of the existence of immiscible
   atomic pairs. Moreover, the multicomponent alloy exhibits better
   corrosion resistance than that for the base alloy. The glassy phase
   changes to a supercooled liquid state at 720 K and then starts to
   crystallize at 754 K with a single exothermic peak, in contrast to the
   appearance of a wide supercooled liquid region for the base alloy. The
   primary crystalline phase precipitates with very short incubation time
   and very low growth rate, which are different from those for the base
   alloy. The extremely low growth rate of the crystallites is presumably
   due to the reduction of diffusivity of late transition metal elements
   resulting from multiplication. Thus, the high-order multiplication has
   the features of (1) the maintenance of high glass-forming ability even
   at the lower Co, Ni and Cu content and in the absence of wide
   supercooled liquid region, (2) the suppression of the decrease in
   mechanical strength even in the dissolution of immiscible elements, (3)
   better corrosion resistance, and (4) low growth rate of the primary
   precipitates. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Alloy nanoparticles are important in many fields, including catalysis,
   plasmonics, and electronics, due to the chemical and physical properties
   that arise from the interactions between their components. Typically,
   alloy nanoparticles are made by solution-based synthesis; however,
   scanning-probe-based methods offer the ability to make and position such
   structures on surfaces with nanometer-scale resolution. In particular,
   scanning probe block copolymer lithography (SPBCL), which combines
   elements of block copolymer lithography with scanning probe techniques,
   allows one to synthesize nanoparticles with control over particle
   diameter in the 2-50 nm range. Thus far, single-element structures have
   been studied in detail, but, in principle, one could make a wide variety
   of multicomponent systems by controlling the composition of the polymer
   ink, polymer feature size, and metal precursor concentrations. Indeed,
   it is possible to use this approach to synthesize alloy nanoparticles
   comprised of combinations of Au, Ag, Pd, Ni, Co, and Pt. Here, such
   structures have been made with diameters deliberately tailored in the 10
   20 nm range and characterized by STEM and EDS for structural and
   elemental composition. The catalytic activity of one class of AuPd alloy
   nanoparticles made via this method was evaluated with respect to the
   reduction of 4-nitrophenol with NaBH4. In addition to being the first
   catalytic studies of particles made by SPBCL, these proof-of-concept
   experiments demonstrate the potential for SPBCL as a new method for

AB The evolution of microstructure, texture and fraction of annealing twin
   boundaries is studied in Ni-60 wt.%Co and equiatomic CoCrFeMnNi high
   entropy alloy (HEA) with similar low stacking fault energy (SFE). The
   two materials are cold-rolled to 90% reduction in thickness and
   subjected to different annealing treatments to achieve very similar
   average grain size. The twin boundary fraction in the two materials was
   found to be similar for the same average grain size. This indicated that
   twin boundary fraction depended on the final grain size. The two alloys
   revealed a strong brass type deformation texture typical of low SFE
   materials. However, the texture after grain growth in the two alloys was
   strikingly dissimilar. The Ni-Co alloy showed strong alpha-fiber (ND//<
   110 >) components, namely, G ({110}< 011 >) and G/B ({110}< 115 >) due
   to the preferential growth of these components. In contrast, the
   microstructure of the HEA showed no preferential grain growth and
   texture components in HEA revealed only minor changes. These sharply
   different microstructure and texture formation mechanisms in the two
   alloys could be explained on the basis of sluggish diffusion in
   multicomponent HEA which greatly diminished grain boundary mobility and
   restricted preferential grain growth. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB The component activity of Mn in Fe-C-Mn system as well as the component
   activities of C and Si in Fe-C-Si system was predicted by applying the
   pseudo-multicomponent approach of the molecular interaction volume model
   (MIVM) and the Wagner interaction parameter formalism (WIPF)
   respectively. The average relative errors between the predicted values
   of MIVM and the experimental data for the three components were 4. 5%
   17. 0% and 13. 0%, respectively, and those between the calculation
   results of the WIPF and the experimental data were 18. 0% for Mn, 9. 0%
   for C and 27. 0% for Si. The results indicated that the MIVM method
   could better predict the component activity of carbonaceous iron-based
   solution. Based on the data in an actual blowing process, the MIVM
   method was applied to predict the component activities of C and V as
   well as the transition temperature of vanadium oxidization (TTVO) in
   Fe-C-V-Si quaternary iron-based solution, and a comparative analysis of
   the predictions against the experimental data was carried out, with
   their average relative errors being 24. 0% for C, 7. 3% for V and 1. 0%
   for TTVO respectively. On that basis, the TTVO at Panzhihua Iron and
   Steel (Group) Co., Ltd. was estimated by the MIVM method and an
   expression that the TTVO changed with composition and temperature of
   iron solutions was obtained by multiple linear regression method. The
   research results showed that the estimated values were in good agreement
   with the practieal data.

AB By employing six groups of bulk diffusion couples together with electron
   probe microanalysis technique, the composition dependence of ternary
   interdiffusion coefficients in Co-rich fcc Co-Mo-W alloys at 1373 K was
   determined via the Whittle and Green method. The experimental
   interdiffusion coefficients were critically assessed to obtain the
   atomic mobilities of Co, Mo and Win fcc Co-Mo-W alloys by using the
   DICTRA (Diffusion-Controlled TRAnsformations) software package.
   Comprehensive comparisons between the calculated and experimental data
   show that a good agreement is obtained for diffusivities in binary Co-Mo
   and ternary Co-Mo-W systems. In addition, a further verification of the
   obtained atomic mobilities was carried out through comparing the
   model-predicted concentration profiles/diffusion paths of several
   diffusion couples with the corresponding experimental data. The results
   indicate that the atomic mobilities can reproduce the experiment data
   reasonably well. This work contributes to the establishment of a

AB A novel, two-step chemical reduction route is suggested to synthesize

   chemically reduced graphene oxide (rGO) for the alcohol-tolerant oxygen
   reduction reaction. In this work, molecular-level dispersions of

   stablization agent for Pd3Sn nanoparticles, and as carbon support which
   is co-deposited with metal or alloy particles. Transmission electron
   microscopy, Raman and powder X-ray diffraction results show that Pd and
   Pd3Sn nanoparticles are finely-dispersed on multi-layer rGO with
   well-controlled particle sizes, dispersities and composition
   uniformities. Electrochemical measurements confirm that Pd3Sn/rGO
   exhibites higher oxygen reduction activity and alcohol-tolerant ability
   than the Pd/rGO thanks to the smaller sizes of Pd3Sn nanoparticles and
   the strong interaction between metal and rGO. This new strategy provides
   a facile route to synthesize multicomponent alloy loaded rGO composites
   for use in electro-catalysis.

AB Impurity-based, premelting-like, intergranular films (IGFs, a common
   type of grain boundary complexion) can form in various materials and
   influence sintering, creep, and microstructure development. A
   thermodynamic framework is presented to forecast the formation and
   stability of these premelting-like grain boundary complexions (a.k.a.
   interfacial "phases" that are thermodynamically two dimensional) in
   multicomponent alloys to consider the interactions of multiple alloying
   elements. Key thermodynamic parameters that control the interfacial
   segregation and disordering behaviors have been identified and
   systematically examined. Subsequently, ternary and quaternary grain
   boundary diagrams have been computed and used to forecast the sintering
   behaviors of W-Ni-M (M = Fe, Co, Cr, Zr, Nb and Ti) and Mo-Si-B-M (M =
   Ni, Co and Fe) systems. This work supports a long-range scientific goal
   of extending bulk computational thermodynamics and CALPHAD methods to
   interfaces and developing grain boundary complexion (interfacial
   "phase") diagrams as extensions to bulk phase diagrams, which can be a
   generally useful materials science tool. (C) 2015 Acta Materialia Inc.

   Co-Al, were determined by the generalized Hall method. For all
   concentrations, the ternary main interdiffusion coefficients , and the

   whereas the cross term varies only slightly with Al. The values of the

   data on the enthalpy of formation, lattice parameter, melting point and

   of the Ti-rich Ti-Fe-Co in situ composites consisting of ultrafine

   22, 24) are synthesized by arc melting cum suction casting technique
   under high purity Ar atmosphere to obtain alloy cylinders having
   diameter (I center dot) of 3 mm. Detailed X-ray diffraction and electron
   microscopic (SEM and TEM) study are carried out to identify the phases
   as well as to monitor the sequence of phase evolution in the ternary
   alloys. The present study conclusively proves that the Ti65Fe10Co25,
   Ti70Fe30-x Co (x) (x = 10, 20, 25), and Ti75Fe15Co10 alloys show the
   ternary quasi-peritectic reaction of L + Ti(Co,Fe) -> (beta-Ti)(ss) +
   Ti-2(Co,Fe) at invariant point P (=Ti75.5 +/- 0.8Fe6.3 +/- 2.1Co18.2 +/-
   2.7) which is cooperated by means of eutectic reaction of L ->
   (beta-Ti)(ss) + Ti-2(Co,Fe) below P and peritectic reaction L +
   Ti(Co,Fe) -> Ti-2(Co,Fe) for Ti65Fe10Co25,Ti70Fe10Co20, and Ti70Fe5Co25
   alloys or eutectic reaction L -> (beta-Ti)(ss) +Ti(Co,Fe) for
   Ti70Fe20Co10, and Ti75Fe15Co10 alloys above the point P. In addition,
   the peritectic reaction L + Ti(Co,Fe) -> Ti-2(Co,Fe) plays a significant
   role in the phase evolution. The microstructural evolution, phase
   equilibria and solidification pathways have been explained by generating
   liquidus projection of the investigated alloys. Interestingly, the Co
   addition leads to the formation of complex Ti2Co phase and significantly
   affects the compositional stability of TiFe phase. This is found to have
   significant influence on the microstructural development during suction
   casting of the investigated alloys.

AB Nanoalloys are bi- or multi-component metallic particles in the size
   range between 1 and 100 nm. Nanoalloys present a wide variety of
   structures and properties, which make them suitable for many
   applications in catalysis, optics, magnetism and biomedicine. This
   topical review is devoted to the structural properties of nanoalloys of
   weakly miscible metals, which are expected to present phase-separated
   arrangements of their components, such as core-shell and Janus
   arrangements. The focus is on singling out size-and
   composition-dependent transitions between these arrangements, showing
   that several transitions can be rationalized by a unifying concept, that
   is symmetry breaking, caused by the accumulation of strain at the atomic
   level and its subsequent release. The driving forces that rule the
   interplay between core-shell and other structures and determine the
   actual shapes of core and shell, and the placement of the core inside
   the shell are analyzed. Several systems, such as Ag-Cu, Ag-Co, Ag-Ni,
   Au-Co, Au-Pt, and Ir-Pt are treated, comparing computational results to
   experimental observations and simple analytical models. After treating
   the lowest-energy structures, which are representative of the
   equilibrium configurations at sufficiently low temperatures,
   high-temperature and growth kinetics effects are considered.

   V, Cr, Mo, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu (S <sub>mix</sub>=13.4-16.2 J/mol*К). They
   contain intermetallic polycomponent s-phase and FCC-substitutional solid
   solution in quantity from 0 up to 100 mass %. Electronic concentrations
   Сsd of alloys are within 6.9 - 8.2 electron/atom. Dependencies between
   three characteristics of alloys chemical composition, its calculated
   value of electronic concentration Csd and experimentally obtained ratio
   of s-phase to FCC-phase are evaluated. It is shown that the value of
   electronic concentration, Сsd, for HEAs of a type under consideration
   reflects not only their chemical and phase structure, but also a
   quantitative ratio of s-phase and the FCC-phase in them. Using
   electronic concentration of individual elements and thermodynamic
   characteristics of s-forming pairs in alloys, a physical interpretation
   of their effect on a change in quantity of s-phase and FCC-phase in HEAs
   is suggested. An effect of quantity of s-phase in HEAs and individual
   elements in them on hardness, elastic modulus and elastic deformation is
   measured by method of tool automatic indentation.

   элементов из числа V, Cr, Mo, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu (энтропия смешивания -

   закономерности связи между тремя характеристиками: химическим составом
   сплава, его расчетной величиной электронной концентрации Csd и
   экспериментально определенным количественным соотношением s-фазы и
   ГЦК-фазы. Установлено, что величина электронной концентрации Сsd ВЭСов

   характеристик s-образующих пар в сплавах предложено физическое
   обоснование их влияния на изменение количества s-фазы и ГЦК-фазы в

AB Seven cast multicomponent (5-7 elements, among which Cr, Mo, W, Mn, Fe,
   Co, Ni) equiatomic three-phase alloys are studied. They contain
   intermetallic polycomponent m- phases that include m-forming elements
   Mo, W, Fe, Co) together with BCC- and FCC-substitutional solid
   solutions. Tungsten is present in all alloys. Formation of the phase
   compositions of the alloys was studied taking into account individual
   characteristics of the chemical elements and their electronic
   concentration Csd. At melt crystallization at a temperature higher than
   2000 <sup>о</sup>С, BCC-substitutional solid solution crystallizes on
   the basis of tungsten (~60 ат. %) and molybdenum (~30 ат. %) is
   crystallized first as dendrites. At temperatures between 1400 and 1500
   <sup>о</sup>С a polycomponent m-phase, which includes all elements, is
   formed; the contents of elements being close to equiatomic. It has also
   a dendrite shape, contacts all primary dendrites BCC-phase. Then at
   temperatures 1270-1360 <sup>о</sup>С, FCC-substitutional solid solutions
   crystallizes on the basis of FCC-metals (their total content is ~70 at.
   %). It locates mainly between dendrites and crystals of m-phase in
   composition of eutectic in which the m-phase is second component. The
   maximum quantity of m- and BCC-phases in an alloy is about 50 mass. %,
   FCC-phase is about 65 mass. %. When electronic concentration increases
   from Csd=7.40 up to Csd=8.00 el/at the quantity of m-phase decreases
   from 50 to ~10 mass. % in the interval of Csd between 7.60 and 8.00
   el/at, the quantity of FCC and BCC-phases is going up just slightly. An
   optimum combination, high-temperature strength and ductility of alloys
   is achieved at a quantitative ratio of m-, BCC- and FCC-phases equal to
   40-45-15 mass. %. The elastic modulus of alloys at room temperature
   measured by indentation is between 130 and 190 GPa.

   поликомпонентные интерметаллидные m-фазы (включают m-образующие элементы
   Mo, W, Fe, Co) в сочетании с твердыми растворами замещения, которые
   имеют ОЦК и ГЦК кристаллические решетки. Все сплавы содержат вольфрам. С
   учетом индивидуальных характеристик металлов, а также электронной
   концентрации Csd сплавов данного типа установлены закономерности и
   особенности формирования фазового состава и количественного соотношения
   фаз при кристаллизации и их влияние на механические свойства. При
   кристаллизации расплава в первую очередь при температуре выше 2000
   <sup>о</sup>С кристаллизуется ОЦК-твердый раствор замещения на основе
   вольфрама (~60 ат. %) и молибдена (~30 ат. %), который структурно
   представлен в виде дендритов. При температуре 1400-1500 <sup>о</sup>С
   образуется поликомпонентная m-фаза, которая включает все элементы
   химического шихтового состава; содержание элементов близко к
   эквиатомному. Она также структурно представлена в виде дендритов,
   которые непосредственно прилегают практически ко всем первичным
   дендритам ОЦК-фазы. Затем при температурах 1270-1360 <sup>о</sup>С
   кристаллизуется ГЦК-твердый раствор замещения на основе ГЦК-металлов (их
   суммарное содержание составляет ~70 ат. %). ГЦК-фаза располагается в
   промежутках между дендритами и кристаллами m-фазы, главным образом, в
   составе эвтектики, вторым компонентом которой является m-фаза.
   Максимальное количество m- и ОЦК-фаз в сплаве находится на уровне 50
   масс. %, ГЦК-фазы - на уровне 65 масс. %. С увеличением электронной
   концентрации от Csd=7,40 до Csd=8,00 эл/ат химического шихтового состава
   сплава количество m-фазы в нем снижается от 50 до ~10 масс. %; в
   пределах Csd=7,60-8,00 эл/ат количество ГЦК- и ОЦК-фаз незначительно
   возрастает. Оптимальное сочетание высокотемпературных прочностных и
   пластических характеристик сплавов достигается при количественном
   соотношении m-, ОЦК- и ГЦК-фаз на уровне, соответственно, 40-45-15 масс.

AB High-entropy alloys (HEAs) are a class of alloys that are being
   considered for a number of applications. In the present study, the
   microstructures and 1050A degrees C oxidation behaviors of two HEAs,
   Al10Cr22.5Co22.5Ni22.5Fe22.5 (at.%) and Al20Cr25Co25Ni25Si5 have been
   investigated along with Al15Cr10Co35Ni35Si5, which is a high-temperature
   shape-memory alloy. Oxide formation occurred via selective oxidation in
   a manner that was consistent with the oxide formation model devised by
   Giggins and Pettit for model Ni-Cr-Al alloys. The lower Al content alloy
   formed an external Cr2O3 scale and an internal subscale consisting of
   Al2O3 and AlN precipitates. The higher Al content alloys exhibited
   smaller mass gains and formed external Al2O3 scales without any internal
   oxidation of the alloys.

AB Ternary ZnxCd1-xSe alloys are potential materials for sensitized
   photovoltaic devices because of their tunable bandgaps and band
   structures. In this work, random deposition of Cd and Zn was realized by
   the co-evaporated chemical vapor deposition method to tune the
   distribution of the lattice constant and the mixing of the structural
   phase to the utmost, and thus release the misfit stress by the
   self-adaption mechanism. As a result, the coaxial nanowire with an
   approximate composition x of 0.5 exhibited the high crystal quality and
   the long nonequilibrium carrier lifetime because of the alloy disorder
   effect. The corresponding photo-electrochemical cell acquired a power
   conversion efficiency of 3.68%. This work paves the way for the design
   and development of high-efficiency coaxial solar cells based on ternary
   or multi-component alloys.

AB Understanding the adsorption phenomena of small adsorbates involved in
   surface reactions on transition metals is important because their
   adsorption strength can be a descriptor for predicting the catalytic
   activity. To explore adsorption energies on a wide range of binary
   transition metal alloys, however, tremendous computational efforts are
   required. Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, here we
   suggest a "surface mixing rule'' to predict the adsorption energies of
   H, O, S, CO and OH on bimetallic alloys, based on the linear
   interpolation of adsorption energies on each pure surface. As an
   application, the activity of CO oxidation on various bimetallic alloys
   is predicted from the adsorption energies of CO and O easily obtained by
   the surface mixing rule. Our results provide a useful tool for rapidly
   estimating adsorption energies, and furthermore, catalytic activities on
   multi-component metal alloy surfaces.

   PtC catalyst (229.5 mA mg(pt)(-1) and 0.5 mA cm(-2) respectively).
   Moreover, the CO stripping peak of np-PtRuCuOsIr is 0.54 V (vs. SCE),
   130 mV negative shift in comparison with the commercial PtC (0.67 V vs.
   SCE). The half-wave potential of np-PtRuCuOsIr is 0.900 V vs. RHE, 36 mV
   positive compared with that of the commercial PtC (0.864 V vs. RHE). The
   np-PtRuCuOsIr catalyst also shows 1.8 and 3.8 times enhancement in the

AB Investigation of Ga influence on the structure of Fe-Cr and Fe-Co alloys
   was performed with the use of Mossbauer spectroscopy and X-ray
   diffraction methods. The experimental results are compared with results
   of first-principles calculations of the mixing and solubility energies
   for Ga in an Fe-X (X = Co, Cr) alloy both in ferromagnetic and
   paramagnetic states. It is shown that Ga mainly goes into the solid
   solutions of the base alloys. In the alloys of the Fe-Cr system, doping
   with Ga handicaps the decomposition of solid solutions, observed in the
   binary alloys, and increases its stability. In the alloys with Co, Ga
   also favors the uniformity of solid solutions. The results of the
   first-principles calculations testify in favor of a preferable
   dissolution of Ga in the FeCo regions of a multicomponent structure
   rather than FeCr regions, both types of regions being in the
   ferromagnetic state at the temperature of annealing. The analysis of
   Mossbauer experiments gives some grounds to conclude that if, owing to
   liquation, clusterization, or initial stages of phase separation, there
   exist regions enriched in iron, some amount of Ga atoms prefer to enter
   the nearest surroundings of iron atoms, thus forming binary Fe-Ga
   regions (or phases). (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   this study, the influence of TiAlN, CrAlSiN and TiAlSiN coatings on the
   wear behavior and cutting performance of the carbide cutting tools was
   investigated in dry machining of a Ti-6Al-4V alloy. TiAlN, CrAlSiN and
   TiAlSiN coatings were deposited on tungsten carbide milling inserts by
   using cathodic arc evaporation. The deposited TiAlN, CrAlSiN and TiAlSiN
   possess high hardness of 31 +/- 1 GPa, 36 +/- 2 and 35 +/- 2 GPa,
   respectively. After annealing at 700 degrees C in air, the hardness of
   the CrAlSiN and TiAlSiN still keeps as high as 35-36 GPa, while the
   hardness of TiAlN decreases to 26 GPa. The main wear modes for the
   TiAlSiN-, TiAlN coated- and uncoated tools are abrasion and adhesion.
   The nanocrystalline TiAlSiN coatings retard the tool wear as compared to
   the TiAlN-coated tools. At a high cutting speed of 350 m/min, the tool
   life of the CrAlSiN coatings exceeds the TiAlSiN-, and TiAlN-coated and
   uncoated tools by 2.9, 42 and 9.5 times, respectively. The CrAlSiN
   coatings show high wear resistances in dry machining of Ti-6Al-4V
   alloys, and thus possess the best cutting performance. (C) 2014 Elsevier

AB We report on the magnetic and thermal properties [magnetization,
   specific heat, thermal expansion, magnetostriction, and magnetocaloric
   effect (MCE)] for the three multicomponent systems TbxDyyGdzCo2,
   TbxDyyHoz(Co, Fe)(2), and TbxDyyErz(Co, Fe)(2) (x + y + z = 1). We show
   that for TbxDyyRzCo2, the Curie temperatures, T-C (which ranged from 130
   to 300 K), and order of the phase transition (first or second order)
   could be controlled by composition. The highest MCE values (the
   adiabatic temperature change Delta T-ad = 2.2-2.3 K at mu(0)Delta H =
   1.8 T) were observed for the compounds exhibiting the transitions of the
   first order. Giant volume magnetostriction of 1500-2000 and 500-600 ppm
   is demonstrated at a field of mu H-0 = 10 and 1.2 T, respectively.
   Structural and magnetic entropy contributions to the total isothermal
   entropy change are estimated for TbxDyyRzCo2. Regular recurrence and/or
   change of the physical properties across the varied composition of the
   compounds allows us to find the materials with desired magnetic
   characteristics, such as T-C, MCE, and magnetostriction, to use them in
   practice.

AB To maintain sustainable energy supply and improve the safety and
   efficiency of nuclear reactors, development of new and advanced nuclear
   materials with superior resistance to irradiation damage is necessary.
   Recently, a new generation of structural materials, termed as
   multicomponent equimolar alloys and/or high entropy alloys (HEAs), are
   being developed. These alloys consist of multicomponent elements for
   maximizing the compositional entropy, which stabilizes the solid
   solution phase. In this paper, preliminary studies on the irradiation
   damage in equimolar alloys and HEAs by High Voltage Electron Microscopy
   (HVEM) are reported [1-4]. (1)ZrHfNb equimolar alloys [1, 2]A
   multicomponent ZrHfNb alloy was prepared by a co-sputtering process
   using elemental Zr, Hf, and Nb targets using an AJA International ATC
   2000-V system. A single-phase bcc solid solution was obtained in the
   ZrHfNb alloy with an approximately equiatomic ratio of its constituent
   elements. The irradiation-induced structural change in the ZrHfNb
   equimolar alloys with the bcc solid solution structure was investigated
   by HVEM using the Hitachi H-3000 installed at Osaka University. The
   polycrystalline bcc phase shows high phase stability against irradiation
   damage at 298 K; the bcc solid solution phase, whose grain size was
   about 20 nm, remained as a main constituent phase even after the severe
   irradiation damage that reached 10 dpa. (2)CoCrCuFeNi HEAs [3]A
   single-phase fcc solid solution was obtained in a CoCrCuFeNi alloy. The
   microstructure of the alloy depended on the preparation technique: a
   nanocrystalline CoCrCuFeNi alloy with an approximately equiatomic ratio
   of its constituent elements was obtained by a co-sputtering process with
   multi-targets, while polycrystalline structures were formed when the
   arc-melting method was used. Both nanocrystalline and polycrystalline
   structures showed high phase stability against fast electron irradiation
   at temperatures ranging from 298 K to 973 K; a fcc phase remained as the
   main constituent phase over 40 dpa of irradiation. The grain coarsening
   of the crystalline phase can be seen during the annealing in a
   nanocrystalline CoCrCuFeNi alloy, while the irradiation-induced grain
   coarsening did not occur at 773 K as well as at 298 K.

AB Multicomponent alloying is an effective design route to increase

   theory calculations and experimental assessment of the elastic
   properties of a series of ternary transition metal nitride coatings.
   M1(1) (-) (x)M2(x)N films (M1, M2 = Ti, Zr, Ta) were elaborated by
   reactive magnetron co-sputtering. The structural (texture and
   microstructure) and growth morphology evolution as a function of film
   thickness and chemical composition were investigated by X-ray
   diffraction, X-ray reflectivity, electron probe microanalysis and
   scanning electron microscopy. The effective elastic constants, C-33 and
   C-44, were obtained from longitudinal and transverse sound velocity
   measurements, using picosecond ultrasonics (PU) and Brillouin light
   scattering (BLS), respectively. We employ Blackman diagram, as well as
   Pugh and Pettifor criteria, to derive trends in elastic anisotropy,
   bonding character and brittleness vs. ductility. The influence of
   microstructure and preferred orientation on the elastic response of
   polycrystalline films is discussed. For Ta-rich TiTaN and TaZrN systems,
   the formation of a nanocomposite system consisting of a mixture of cubic
   and hexagonal phases has a beneficial contribution to toughening. (C)

   Ni, Co and Fe were introduced into a Cu plate as contaminants from the
   grinding media one after the other by 15-min ball treatment. The
   composite structure was formed as a result of mechanical intermixing of
   the components. The particle size in as-fabricated layer ranged from 2
   nm to 20 nm, with average values of about 7 nm. As-fabricated layer
   contained non-equilibrium multicomponent solid solution based on FCC Cu
   crystal structure, Zr-based phase, nanosized steel debris and amorphous
   phase. The hardness of the as-fabricated composite was almost ten times
   that of the initial Cu plate.

AB Thermodynamic calculations based on the CALPHAD method are nowadays
   often applied in the design of new materials due to increasing demands
   on shorter lead times for development. However, such calculations rely
   heavily on the assessed thermodynamic descriptions, which in turn rely
   on the amount and quality of available experimental data, especially for
   binary and ternary sub-systems. The ternary Co-Cr-C system is an
   extremely important subsystem to, e.g., multi-component cemented carbide
   grades, such as W-Co-Cr-M-C (M = Ti,Ta,Nb,V,Zr,Hf), as well as
   Cr-containing Co-base alloys. In the case of the Co-Cr-C system, there
   is a lack of reliable data on the solubility of Co in Cr-carbides.
   Therefore, the present work concerns an experimental study of the
   solubility of Co in all three of the Cr-based carbides, i.e., Cr23C6,
   Cr7C3, and Cr3C2. This was done by synthesizing appropriate samples in
   the M7C3+M23C6+liquid and M7C3+M3C2+graphite three-phase fields. The
   results show that a recent thermodynamic description of the Co-Cr-C
   system is unable to reproduce the experimentally determined
   solubilities. Therefore, the present study provides important input for
   future alloy development and improvement of the thermodynamic
   description of the Co-Cr-C system.

AB One or more disordered solid solutions (DSS) are entropically stabilized
   in high entropy alloys (HEA), in competition with possible intermetallic
   compounds or phase segregation. In spite of the supreme role of Gibbs
   free energy, various parameters have been used to understand the
   formation of DSS in multicomponent alloys. These include, the
   delta-parameter (based on atomic size differences between the elements),
   the enthalpy of mixing (Delta H-mix) the Omega-parameter (T-m Delta
   S-mix/vertical bar Delta H-mix vertical bar). These parameters have had
   different degrees of success in the context of understanding the
   formation of DSS in multi-component alloys. In the current work, we
   develop a purely geometrical parameter (Lambda = Delta S-mix/delta(2))
   to predict the formation of DSS. Ranges are prescribed for this
   parameter for the formation of: (a) DSS, (b) a mixture involving
   compounds and (c) (only) compound(s). Results from the literature are
   used to highlight the utility of the Lambda-parameter, in the context of
   other standard approaches. The role of the value of the Lambda-parameter
   in understanding the nature (complexity) and volume fraction of the
   compound formed is also highlighted. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   metal based AB(2) metal hydride alloys, the surface of the powder is
   covered with oxides as a product of oxidation from the electrolyte and
   protected by zirconium oxide and vanadium-rich BCC-structured secondary
   phase. In the rare-earth based AB(5) and A(2)B(7) metal hydride alloys,
   the surface is decorated with nano-structured needles and larger-scaled
   rods of hydroxides from the precipitation of rare earth ions after the
   oxidation by the electrolyte. Further TEM studies show the existence of
   a buffer oxide layer sandwiched between the inclusion-embedded surface
   oxide and alloy bulk in both AB(2) and AB(5) alloys. In both cases, the
   inclusions are found to be metallic nanocrystals mainly composed of Ni
   and Co as determined by electron energy loss spectroscopy, selective
   area electron diffraction, transmission electron atomic image, and X-ray
   energy dispersive spectroscopy. The Co-to-Ni ratio in the inclusion is
   larger than that in the bulk due to the less corrosive nature of Co. The
   additions of Co and Al in the AB(2) are found to reduce number of
   activation cycles needed to generate a surface oxide with proper
   catalytic capability. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   prepared in the form of a ceramic pellet by high-temperature synthesis
   and the sintering of preliminarily pressed stoichiometric mixture of
   powders. Iron in these ceramics is replaced with an alloying metal by no
   more than 3 at %. The rest (7 at %) of the metal is in the form of
   precipitates of other phases. X-ray diffraction analysis of the grown
   films has shown that they are single-crystal and free of any
   precipitates of other crystallographic orientations and phases. This is
   evidence of the complete (10 at %) replacement of iron with a doping
   metal in the film structure. This circumstance indicates that the
   synthesis of components occurs more actively and completely during laser
   ablation (than in solid-phase chemical reactions) as a result of the
   transformation of multicomponent target material into plasma. Thus, one
   can fabricate film materials in a wider range of chemical compositions

AB TiZr-based multicomponent metallic films composed of 35 constituents
   with almost equal atomic concentrations were prepared by co-sputtering
   of pure metallic targets in an Ar atmosphere. X-ray diffraction was
   employed to determine phase composition, crystalline structure, lattice
   parameters, texture and crystallite size of the deposited films.
   The deposited films exhibited only solid solution (fcc, bee or hcp) or
   amorphous phases, no intermetallic components being detected. It was
   found that the hcp structure was stabilized by the presence of Hf or Y,
   bee by Nb or Al and fcc by Cu. For the investigated films, the atomic
   size difference, mixing enthalpy, mixing entropy, Gibbs free energy of
   mixing and the electronegativity difference for solid solution and
   amorphous phases were calculated based on Miedema's approach of the

AB Corrosion of metallic structural materials at an elevated temperature in
   complex multicomponent gas environments are potential problems in many
   fossil energy systems, especially those using coal as a feedstock.
   Combating these problems involves a number of approaches, one of which
   is the use of protective coatings. The high velocity oxy fuel (HVOF)
   process has been used to deposit WC-Co/NiCrAlY composite powder on two
   types of Fe-based alloys. Thermocyclic oxidation behavior of coated
   alloys was investigated in the static air as well as in molten salt
   (Na2SO4-60%V2O5) environment at 700 A degrees C for 50 cycles. The
   thermogravimetric technique was used to approximate the kinetics of
   oxidation. WC-Co/NiCrAlY coatings showed a lower oxidation rate in
   comparison to uncoated alloys. The oxidation resistance of WC-Co/NiCrAlY
   coatings can be ascribed to the oxide layer of Al2O3 and Cr2O3 formed on
   the outermost surface. Coated alloys extend a protective oxide scale
   composed of oxides of Ni and Cr that are known to impart resistance to
   the hot corrosion in the molten salt environment.

AB Bulk metallic glasses have attracted considerable attention over the
   last decades for their outstanding mechanical features (high strength,
   super-elasticity) and physico-chemical properties (corrosion
   resistance). Recently, some attempts to assign such original behavior
   from bulk materials to modified surfaces have been reported in the
   literature based on multicomponent alloys.
   In this paper we focused on the opportunity to form a metallic glass
   coating from the binary Zr-Cu system using a magnetron co-sputtering
   physical vapor deposition process. The composition of the films can be
   easily controlled by the relative intensities applied to both pure
   targets, which made possible the study of the whole Zr-Cu system (from
   13.4 to 85.0 at.% Cu). The chemical composition of the films was
   obtained by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and their
   microstructure was characterized by scanning and transmission electron
   microscopy. The thermal stability of the films was deduced from an in
   situ X-ray diffraction analysis (from room temperature up to 600 degrees
   C) and correlated with the results of the differential scanning
   calorimetry technique. Their mechanical properties were determined by
   nanoindentation experiments. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Computational diffusion kinetics (CDK), with a spirit of and being
   coupled with the computational thermodynamics (CT, or called as the
   CALPHAD technique), plays increasingly important role in the alloy
   design/optimization and microstructure control during the processing of
   advanced metallic materials. This paper is to highlight recent progress
   of CDK in research with great focus on novel Ti and Zr alloys, which was
   largely performed in the authors' group. It ends with one representative
   example of the applications of CDK, coupled with CT, quantitative phase
   field, and three-dimensional (3D) statistical calculation, in designing
   the heat-treatment schedule for the dual phase (alpha beta)
   Ti-6Al-4Valloys.

AB The early high-temperature oxidation behavior of Ti(C,N)-based cermets
   with equiatomic AlCoCrFeNi high-entropy alloy binder has been studied,
   as well as the cermet with Ni/Co binder as a reference. Experiments were
   performed at the temperature range of 800-1100 degrees C in static
   laboratory air. The micro-structural evolution of the multi-layered
   oxide scales on the cermets was investigated and the effect of binder
   phase constituent on the oxidation characteristics of Ti(C,N)-based
   cermets was evaluated. The results demonstrated that the cermet with
   AlCoCrFeNi multi-element alloy binder possesses superior oxidation
   resistance, which is greatly better than that of the cermet with Ni/Co
   metallic binder under the same condition. We suggest that the formation
   of a continuous and dense external oxide scale can effectively impede
   the outward diffusion of volatile tungsten oxides and inward oxygen
   transport, leading to a remarkable improvement of oxidation resistance.
   In addition, the enhanced oxidation resistance was related to the high
   Cr and Al concentration in AlCoCrFeNi binder phase that urges the
   formation of oxide layers with more efficient passivation effect against
   oxidation. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Carbon supported Pd-Pt-Cu trimetallic nanocatalysts for formic acid
   oxidation (FAO) are comparatively synthesized via different one-pot
   liquid-phase chemical reduction routes. Either sodium borohydride or
   ethylene glycol is employed as the main reducing agent, with the
   stabilizer opted from disodium ethylenediamine tetraacetate (EDTA),
   oleylamine, sodium citrate and urea. The trimetallic nanocatalyst
   synthesized with ethylene glycol and sodium citrate exhibits the most
   homogeneous nanoparticle dispersion and the highest alloying degree.
   Pd20Pt1Cu10/C-Cit shows the best electrocatalytic performance among all
   the tested electrocatalysts. Componential distributions on nanoalloy
   particles are distinguished through ex situ XPS, CO stripping and in
   situ ATR-IR measurements on interested nanocatalysts. The cheaper
   element Cu functions mainly as the "core filler" to expose a Pd and
   Pt-segregated active surface, and a deliberately controlled small
   fraction of Pt (versus Pd) on the surface minimizes the undesired
   dehydration of formic acid. In addition, a weak electronic effect from
   Cu and Pt may promote FAO on Pd. Surface restructuring with Pt
   agglomeration and partial Cu dealloying arising from a repeated
   potential cycling pretreatment degrades the performance of the ternary
   nanocatalysts. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   formed on their substrate surfaces during immersion in molten Al.
   Pre-oxidation treatment gave rise to the formation of an effective oxide

AB The effect of Co on the as-cast and heat-treated microstructures was
   investigated in two experimental Ni-based single-crystal superalloys
   containing low levels of Re and Ru. The experimental results indicated
   that increasing the Co content from 7.9 to 15.8 wt pct decreased the
   volume fraction of (gamma + gamma') eutectic and the solidification
   segregation ratio of W. High levels of Co additions were also found to
   decrease the solvus temperatures of the gamma' phase and (gamma +
   gamma') eutectic as well as the solidus temperature. During the
   long-term thermal exposure at 1373 K (1100 A degrees C), no TCP phases
   precipitated in either alloy. However, the coarsening and coalescence of
   gamma' precipitates in the alloy containing 15.8 wt pct Co was slower
   than that in the other alloy with 7.9 wt pct Co. In the current study,
   high levels of Co additions decreased the equilibrium volume fraction of
   gamma' phase, leading to a change in the partitioning ratios of
   TCP-forming elements Cr, Mo, Re, and W between the gamma and gamma'
   phases. This change resulted in a lower degree of elemental
   supersaturation in the gamma matrix and improved the phase stability of
   the gamma/gamma' microstructure. These experimental results were then
   compared with those obtained from multi-component thermodynamic
   calculations, and good agreement was observed.

AB To determine the speciation and concentrations of dissolved C-O-H
   volatiles in graphite-saturated martian primitive magmas, we conducted
   piston-cylinder experiments on graphite-encapsulated synthetic melt of
   Adirondack-class Humphrey basaltic composition. Experiments were
   performed over three orders of magnitude in oxygen fugacity (IW+2.3 to
   IW -0.8), and at pressures (1-3.2 GPa) and temperatures (1340-1617
   degrees C) similar to those of possible martian source regions. Oxygen
   fugacities were determined from compositions of coexisting silicate melt
   + FePt alloy, olivine + pyroxene + FePt alloy, or melt + Fe-C liquid.
   Infrared spectra of quenched glasses all show carbonate absorptions at
   1430 and 1520 cm(-1), with CO2 concentrations diminishing under more
   reduced conditions, from 0.50 wt% down to 26 ppm. Carbon contents of
   silicate glasses and Fe-C liquids were measured using secondary ion mass
   spectrometry (SIMS) yielding 36-716 ppm and 6.71-7.03 wt%, respectively.
   Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and SIMS analysis produced similar H2O
   contents of 0.26-0.85 and 0.29-0.40 wt%, respectively. Raman spectra of
   glasses reveal evidence for OH- ions, but no indication of
   methane-related species. FTIR-measured concentrations of dissolved
   carbonate diminish linearly with oxygen fugacity, but more reduced
   conditions yield greater dissolved carbonate concentrations than would
   be expected based on oxidized conditions in previous work. C contents of
   silicate glasses determined by SIMS are consistently higher than C as
   carbonate determined by FTIR. Their difference, termed non-carbonate C,
   correlates well with additional IR absorptions found in reduced glasses
   (f(O2) < IW+0.4) at 1615, 2205, and 3370 cm(-1). These absorption bands
   are not seen in more oxidized glasses, except B441 (IW+1.7), presumably
   because they represent reduced C-bearing complexes. The 2205 cm(-1) peak
   is attributed to a C=O complex, possibly an Fe-carbonyl ion. The 1615
   cm(-1) peak does not correlate with that at 2205 cm(-1), but does
   correlate with non-carbonate C and is in a region commonly associated
   with C=O bonding. The origin of the peak at 3370 cm(-1) is poorly
   understood and could potentially be owing to a variety of C-O-H species
   or to N-H bonding. The intensities of the 1615 and 3370 cm(-1) peaks
   correlate with each other leading us to provisionally attribute both to
   an unspecified complex with both C=O and N-H bonds. These results
   suggest that dissolved species such as carbonyl or other C=O-bearing
   species could be a significant source of C fluxes to the martian
   atmosphere, with minor additions of CO2 and negligible methane
   contributions. By assuming that degassed, reduced C ultimately becomes
   atmospheric CO2, reduced C outgassing may be incorporated in models of
   martian atmospheric evolution. At Humphrey source region conditions
   (1350 +/- 50 degrees C, 1.2 +/- 0.1 GPa) the total C contents are
   equivalent to 1200 ppm CO2 at IW+1 and 475 ppm CO2 at IW, which are 2
   and 4 times higher than the CO2 derived from CO32- alone. For reasonable
   magmatic fluxes over the last 4.5 Ga of martian history, such
   graphite-saturated magmas would produce 0.25 and 0.60 bars from sources
   at IW and IW+1, significantly more than expected solely from
   consideration of dissolved CO2.
   The carbon contents of Fe-C liquids in this study are consistent with
   graphite-saturated carbide liquids becoming more C-rich with increasing
   temperature. Experiments with melt and Fe-C liquid have values of
   D-C(all/sil) between 1.3 x 10(3) and 2.2 x 10(3), potentially allowing
   planetary mantles to retain significant C following core formation. (C)

   increased, both the gaseous phase and electrochemical hydrogen storage
   capacities decreased. 1 at.% Cu-substituted alloy showed both higher

AB Cemented carbides are hard and tough materials for cutting tool,
   consisting of micrometer-sized carbides embedded in a ductile metal
   binder phase. In order to increase the performance and extend the
   service lifetime of the cemented carbides, graded cemented carbides have
   been developed. The formation of gradient zone during liquid phase
   sintering is a diffusion-controlled process, and knowledge of
   diffusivity is indispensable to understand formation mechanism, optimize
   technological parameters and design a new type of graded cemented
   carbides. In this paper, a diffusion database for multi-component
   C-Co-Cr-W-Ta-Ti-Nb-N cemented carbides has been developed through a
   combination of experiment, theoretical analysis and assessment. The
   diffusion database contains the atomic mobility parameters for different
   diffusing elements in liquid and fcc phase. The atomic mobility
   parameters in liquid phase are theoretically calculated by the newly
   modified Sutherland equation, and the atomic mobility parameters in fcc
   phase are optimized by the diffusivities measured in the present work
   and from the literature. In conjunction with the thermodynamic database
   for cemented carbides (CSUTDCC1: Central South University Thermodynamic
   Database for Cemented Carbides-version-1), the diffusion database
   (CSUDDCC1: Central South University Diffusion Database for Cemented
   Carbides-version-1) can be used to simulate the gradient sintering
   process. Simulations of different kinds of graded cemented carbides are
   presented using the databases and compared where possible against
   experimental data, in order to validate its accuracy. (C) 2013 Elsevier

AB Multi-component nucleation theory is applied to decipher the precipitate
   evolution of solution-treated and quenched Fe-25Co-15Mo (mass%) with Si

   simulation of the nucleation and growth kinetics of precipitates, we
   optimize thermodynamic model parameters of the Fe-Co-Mo system with
   experimental data and enthalpies of formation of ternary ferrite phase
   determined by density functional theory analysis. Si-solubility in the
   precipitation-hardening l-phase is considered in the thermodynamic
   modeling. The body-centered cubic (bcc) ferrite phase reveals a
   metastable miscibility gap between Fe- and Mo-rich phase below 1033 K.
   Based on thermodynamic modeling of the Fe-Co-Mo system, it is shown that
   the alloy Fe-25Co-15Mo is located outside the spinodal region, which is
   in contrast to some previous work on this system. Thermo-kinetic
   simulations, which are validated on experimental data from atom probe
   tomography, propose that during aging, the first microstructures form by
   means of nucleation and growth of metastable bcc-precipitates before the
   formation of rhombohedral mu-phase. For the thermokinetic analysis, we
   evaluate and utilize theoretically predicted nucleus compositions of
   bcc-precipitates from the minimum nucleation barrier concept. (C) 2013

   dominated by the "synergetic effect" between the AB(5) main phase and a

   the B2 secondary phase decreased with the annealing process, although
   the gaseous phase storage capacities improved, all the electrochemical
   properties (capacity, high-rate dischargeability, surface exchange
   current, and hydrogen diffusion in the bulk) deteriorated. Besides, with

AB This paper describes anodic materials for fuel cells using borohydride
   as a fuel (DBFC). A fuel cell is an electrochemical device which
   converts chemical energy stored in borohydride ion and in an oxidant,
   directly into electricity by redox processes. In this work the
   electrochemical properties of multicomponent hydrogen storage alloy of
   the AB(5)-type: LaMmNi(3.55)Al(0.30)Mn(0.40)Co(0.75) modified with
   carbon used as anodic materials in a borohydride fuel half-cell are
   discussed. Composites with a small amount of carbon were obtained by
   pyrolysis directly on a hydrogen storage alloy or by carbonization of
   conducting polymers. It was done in order to improve the hydrogen
   electrosorption properties of anode material. The electrochemical
   properties were examined in 6 M KOH solution with the addition of a
   different amount of KBH4, using cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic
   methods. It has been proved that only particular forms of carbon are
   able to promote the electrocatalytic activity of an AB(5) alloy type
   anode and remarkably enlarge the surface area of the working electrode.
   Additionally, tubular morphology of nanocarbons makes fuel diffusion
   easier, in comparison to pores in a carbon layer obtained by
   carbonization of conducting polymers composites.

AB A novel synthesis pathway is proposed in this work to prepare NiCo
   nanoalloy embedded in highly ordered porous carbons via a soft-template
   approach. This involves the multicomponent co-assembly of environmental
   friendly carbon precursors (phloroglucinol and glyoxal), amphiphilic
   copolymer Pluronic F127 as structure directing agent followed by metal
   precursor salts incorporation. This synthesis affords a good control of
   the alloy quantity, composition and particle size in the carbon matrix.
   The influence of the metal loading in the NiCo alloy and of two
   chelating agents, i.e., citric acid and oxalic acid on the
   physical-chemical characteristics of carbon NiCo materials was
   investigated. In the absence of chelating agents, the carbon NiCo hybrid
   materials have a 2-D hexagonally arranged pore structure, high surface
   area and porous volume. The NiCo nanoparticles are homogeneously
   distributed in the carbon network and they exhibit sizes between 30 and
   40 nm depending on the Ni/Co ratio. The use of chelating agents allows
   downsizing the particle size to 15 nm and the modification of the
   hexagonally carbon structure into a worm-like one. The advantage of the
   present synthesized hybrids lays in the use of less expensive 3d
   transition metals than noble elements that may provide comparable effect
   on hydrogen sorption properties. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB The structural relaxation of multicomponent Fe(Co)SiAlGaPCB amorphous
   alloys was investigated calorimetrically for annealed samples over a
   wide temperature range below the glass transition temperature. Upon
   heating, the annealed samples exhibit an endothermic reaction (enthalpy
   relaxation) starting around the annealing temperature and continuing
   over a temperature range of about 50-140 K, that it is followed by a
   broad exothermic reaction. Changes in the heat flow curves with
   annealing temperature and time were analyzed. Experimental values of the
   overall enthalpy change, Delta H, the peak temperature of the difference
   in heat flow between the annealed and the as-quenched samples, T-p, and
   Curie temperature, T-C, were fitted by exponential functions including
   two relaxation times. Values of the two relaxation times are the same
   for different annealing temperatures regardless the considered property.
   Saturation values of these magnitudes show a linear dependence with the
   inverse of the annealing temperature. Tiny domains (2-3 nm in diameter)
   in the matrix observed by spherical aberration corrected high-resolution
   transmission electron microscopy could be attributed to some
   medium-range order in the atomic structure of these quenched alloys. (C)

AB Solid solutioning in equiatomic alloys becomes an interesting and timely
   topic, considering the current interest at high-entropy alloys (HEAs) in
   the materials community. In the circumstances where there is no such a
   differentiation of the solvent and solutes, it is intriguing to explore
   the solid solution limit in HEAs. In this work, a series of fcc
   structured equiatomic alloys were specially designed, following the
   valence electron concentration rule, to study the solid solutioning in
   the assumed pseudo binary Ni-X (X = Co, Fe, Cr, Cu) systems. The solid
   solution limit of the multi-component equiatomic alloys was found to set
   by the topological instability. The decomposition of the single-phase
   solid solution occurred when the lattice distortion reached a critical
   strain of 0.018. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Most theoretical work on solidification focuses on dilute binary alloys,
   while those commonly used in industry are multi-component with high
   solute concentrations. In concentrated alloys, the diffusion of one
   component will be inevitably influenced by the others, which will
   further affect the rapid solidification kinetics. Assuming local
   non-equilibrium at the solid/liquid (S/L) interface and in the bulk
   liquid, the kinetics of planar interface migration and dendrite growth
   in strongly non-equilibrium solidification of Ni-Cu-Co alloys is
   comparatively studied. It is found that, for planar interface kinetics,
   the thermodynamic interactions lead to a non-monotonic tendency of the
   partition coefficient of Co with a slightly lowered interface
   temperature. Meanwhile, for dendrite growth (i.e. curved interface), the
   curvature effect and the thermodynamic interactions together result in
   the non-monotonic variation of partition coefficients. Due to the
   lowered dendrite tip temperature as a result of the thermodynamic
   interactions, larger undercooling is needed for interface migration and
   the dendrite growth is slowed down.

   composite targets produced via the self-propagating high-temperature
   synthesis method. Reviewed substrate materials included Ti-, Ni-, and
   Co-based alloys, insoluble polymers, and deimmunized donor's bones. Our
   results showed that the MuBiNaF deposition can be effectively combined
   with either a bulk material modification to improve its mechanical
   properties, or a surface modification to control surface roughness and
   blind porosity. Among other promising applications, the fabrication of
   hybrid materials incorporated with stem cells or medicine is mentioned.

   fuel sprayed WC-10Co-4Cr coating using X-ray diffraction, scanning
   electron microscope, energy dispersive spectroscopy, differential

   substrate. The coating is mainly composed of WC phase and W2C phase.
   Owing to the high cooling rates of molten droplets and the
   multicomponent system of feedstock powder, amorphous phase is obtained
   in the coating. The crystallisation temperature of the amorphous phase
   is 651 degrees C. The Weibull analysis of Vickers microhardness of the
   coating exhibits a bimodal distribution under indentation load of 300 g
   and a monomodal distribution under indentation load of 100 g. Such
   distribution is attributed to the presence of the poorly bonded splats
   and pores within the coating.

AB Optical and scanning electron microscopy, as well as electron microprobe

   diffusion processes that occur in a diffusion pair that consistsof a
   single-crystal CMSX-10 nickel-base superalloy and polycrystalline
   nickel, at temperatures of 1050-1250A degrees C. It has been found that,
   in this system, the distributions of gamma-stabilizing elements (Cr, Co,
   W, and Re) are described by the Boltzmann solution for diffusion between
   two semiinfinite plates of a binary alloy. The processing of these
   distributions has shown that the diffusion coefficients of Cr, Co, W,
   and Re in the multicomponent system are close to those in binary alloys
   of these elements with Ni. The diffusion redistribution of the elements
   leads to the dissolution of the gamma' phase in the nickel-base
   superalloy, growth of nickel grains toward the superalloy constituent of
   the diffusion pair, and the formation of porosity on both sides of the
   migrating interface, which is determined from a crystal misorientation
   of the alloy single crystal and nickel grains.

   cubic solid-solution structure. With an increased substrate bias and
   Si-target power, their microstructures changed from large columns with a

   grains. The hardness, H/E ratio and H-3/E-2 ratio of

   respectively, suggesting markedly suppressed dislocation activities and
   a very high resistance to wear and plastic deformation, attributable to
   grain refinements and film densification by the application of substrate
   bias, a nanocomposite structure by the introduction of silicon nitrides,
   and a strengthening effect induced by severe lattice distortions. In the

AB Multi-component hybrid nanostructures containing two nanoscaled
   components of FePt and ZnO were successfully fabricated through seed
   mediated growth. The preformed FePt nanoparticles, which were fabricated
   either by the reduction of Pt(acac)(2) and the decomposition of
   Fe(CO)(5) or by simultaneous chemical reduction of Pt(acac)(2) and
   Fe(acac)(3) by 1,2-hexadecanediol at high temperature, work as the
   hetero-nucleation seeds for the preparation of hybrid nanostructures.
   The end products can be either FePt@ZnO core/shell nanoparticle assembly
   or FePt/ZnO nanocomposites, depending on the seeding particle size. If
   the seeding particle size is larger than 3.5 nm, core/shell nanoparticle
   assembly was formed, while if the seeding particle is smaller than 2 nm,
   FePt/ZnO nanocomposites were formed. For the FePt@ZnO core/shell, HRTEM
   showed a quasi-epitaxial growth between the FePt core and the ZnO shell.
   The ZnO shell was highly deformed. The core/shell nanoparticle assembly
   exhibits both semiconducting and magnetic properties which is
   superparamagnetic at room temperature. For the nanocomposites, the
   as-synthesized ultra-small 1.9 nm FePt3 nanoparticles are
   superparamagnetic. After embedding into the ZnO matrix, those
   superparamagnetic nanoparticles become magnetically hard with coercivity
   field of 650 Oe at room temperature. First-principles calculations
   indicate a giant interfacial anisotropic energy, induced by the strong
   spin-orbit interaction between Pt and O at interface, leading to
   room-temperature permanent ferromagnetism. The findings shed light on
   research for new material designs with giant interfacial anisotropy for
   various applications.

AB The CALPHAD technique is a powerful tool for materials processing and
   alloy design. The quality of CALPHAD-type calculations is strongly
   dependent on the quality of the thermodynamic database. In this paper, a
   self-consistent thermodynamic database for multicomponent cemented
   carbides has been developed. The thermodynamic descriptions for all of
   the binary systems and some of the ternary systems are taken from the
   literature with slight modifications for some of the reported
   parameters. A large number of ternary systems are assessed or reassessed
   under the consideration of experimental data and/or the consistency of
   the database. Assessments of some higher-order systems are performed
   based on experimental information, in particular focusing on commercial
   cemented carbide systems. Some examples of simulations for different
   kinds of cemented carbides are shown using the thermodynamic database
   and compared where possible against experimental data, thereby
   validating its accuracy. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   binder were successfully fabricated by mechanical alloying and low
   pressure sintering. The results indicate that the presence of the outer
   rim phase is not obvious, and two different types of binder phase
   existed in the microstructure. From X-ray diffraction patterns, it
   demonstrates that the alloy is composed mainly of Ti(C,N) and single
   face-centered cubic (FCC) solid solution binder phase. The cermet with
   AlCoCrFeNi HEAs binder showed a considerably improved microstructure and
   achieves the co-enhancement of hardness and toughness. The novel
   material exhibits a high Vickers hardness of 1787 MPa, along with a good
   fracture toughness value of 11.4 MPa m(1/2). (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

AB Platinum alloyed with transition metals at various compositions exhibits
   an enhanced catalytic activity for reactions involving oxygen
   activation, but little is known about the significance of oxophilicity
   that may play a role in maneuvering surface oxygenated species through
   the alloyed transition metal sites. Fundamental questions for
   sustainable high catalytic activity involve whether the oxygen
   activation or transfer occurring on the multicomponent particle surface
   induces any significant structural change of the nanoalloy in the
   catalytic process and how this is related to the oxophilicity. This
   paper addresses these questions by determining the catalytic activities
   of CO oxidation and the changes of the lattice parameters of nanoalloy
   particles in the catalytic processes as a function of the introduction
   of a third transition metal (M' = V, Ni, Ir, etc.) into PtCo nanolloys.
   The results reveal an activity enhancement of M' in the order of V > Ni
   > Ir, consistent with the order of oxophilicity of M'. In situ
   synchrotron high energy X-ray diffraction coupled to atomic pair
   distribution function analysis (HE-XRD/PDF) shows that the lattice
   parameter changes under CO oxidation conditions are very small for both
   PtVCo and PtNiCo nanoalloys. By comparing the changes in the lattice
   constant between PtVCo and PtNiCo in oxidation reduction cycles under
   oxygen or hydrogen atmospheres, the former is also shown to exhibit a
   smaller change in lattice constant than those of the latter. The small
   change in the lattice parameter under CO reaction conditions is believed
   to reflect a surface self-regulation of the oxygenated species by the
   second and third transition metals in the nanoalloy (e.g., V and Co in
   PtVCo nanoalloy). Implications of the new insights into the unique
   integrity of the atomic-scale structure of platinum alloyed with
   transition metals are also discussed.

   Ni-cermet electrode with addition of Cu and impregnated with CeO2-delta
   in contact with the YSZ electrolyte in the reducing gas mixtures of
   different composition were studied by means of impedance spectroscopy at
   the temperature of 900 degrees C. In H-2 + H2O binary gas mixtures the
   degradation rate (decrease of electrochemical activity over time) of the
   Ni-cermet electrode increases sharply at the partial pressure of water
   over 45 vol.%. The degradation rate of the Ni-cermet electrode in the
   10%CO + 90%CO2 gas mixture is significantly slower than in the 10%H-2 +
   90%H2O gas mixture. The analysis of the impedance spectra showed that at
   the equilibrium potential the electrode reaction is limited by three
   stages. Major changes in the characteristics of the electrode during
   long exposures under working condition are associated with the changes
   ranger of the partial polarization resistances high- and

   is found that the deposition rate of the AlTiWTaNbCr films decreases as
   the increase in the bias voltage. The microstructure of the deposited

AB Nanoscale alloys attract enormous research attentions in catalysis,
   magnetics, plasmonics and so on. Along with multicomponent synergy,
   quantum confinement and extreme large surface area of nanoalloys offer
   novel material properties, precisely and broadly tunable with chemical
   composition and nanoscale dimension. Despite substantial progress of
   nanoalloy synthesis, the randomized positional arrangement and
   dimensional/compositional inhomogeneity of nanoalloys remain significant
   technological challenges for advanced applications. Here we present a
   generalized route to synthesize single-crystalline intermetallic
   nanoalloy arrays with dimensional and compositional uniformity via
   self-assembly. Specific electrostatic association of multiple ionic
   metal complexes within self-assembled nanodomains of block copolymers
   generated patterned monodisperse bimetallic/trimetallic nanoalloy arrays
   consisting of various elements, including Au, Co, Fe, Pd, and Pt. The
   precise controllability of size, composition, and intermetallic
   crystalline structure of nanoalloys facilitated tailored synergistic
   properties, such as accelerated catalytic growth of vertical carbon
   nanotubes from Fe-Co nanoalloy arrays.

   multi-component cemented carbides has been developed through a
   combination of experimental, theoretical and assessment work. Ti and N
   activity profiles between the surface and bulk are thermodynamically
   calculated to show the influence to the gradient zone. The modified

   Based on the databases, the gradient zone formation of the cemented

   compared with the experimental results to demonstrate the application of
   the established databases. Besides, the growth rate of the fcc-free
   surface layers and the maximum value of cobalt peak in cemented carbides
   as a function of nitrogen or titanium content are predicted. Crown

   obtain the micro-fluidic systems with low roughness. Then the
   elastomeric mould was obtained using casting with one face that contains
   all the details of the original master, very well defined and smooth

   The objective of the paper is to develop metallic micro-structured die

AB Direct use of solid sodium borohydride (NaBH4) to react with minimized
   amount of water provides a straightforward means for increasing the
   hydrogen density of the system. But meanwhile, the resulting
   solid-liquid reaction system always suffers from serious kinetic
   problem. Our study found that the cobalt-molybdenum-boron (Co-Mo-B)
   catalyst prepared using an ethylene glycol solution of cobalt chloride
   is highly effective for promoting the hydrolysis reaction of solid
   NaBH4. Particularly, a combined usage of small amounts of Co-Mo-B
   catalyst, aluminum powder and sodium hydroxide enables a rapid and
   high-yield hydrogen generation from the hydrolysis reaction of solid
   NaBH4. A systematic study has been conducted to investigate the property
   dependence of the system on the components. In addition, the by-products
   of reaction were analyzed using powder X-ray diffraction and
   thermogravimetry/differential scanning calorimety/mass spectroscopy
   techniques. Our study demonstrates that the multi-component system with
   an optimized composition can fulfill over 95% fuel conversion, yielding
   6.43 wt% hydrogen within 3 mm. The favorable combination of high
   hydrogen density, fast hydrogen generation kinetics and high fuel

AB Sluggish diffusion kinetics is an important contributor to the
   outstanding properties of high-entropy alloys. However, the diffusion
   kinetics in high-entropy alloys has never been probed directly. Here,
   the diffusion couple method was used to measure the diffusion parameters
   of Co, Cr, Fe, Mn and Ni in ideal-solution-like Co-Cr-Fe-Mn-Ni alloys.
   These parameters were compared with those in various conventional
   face-centered cubic metals. The results show that the diffusion
   coefficients in the Co-Cr-Fe-Mn-Ni alloys are indeed lower than those in
   the reference metals. Correspondingly, the activation energies in the
   high-entropy alloys are higher than those in the reference metals.
   Moreover, the trend of the normalized activation energy is positively
   related to the number of composing elements in the matrix. A
   quasi-chemical model is proposed to analyze the fluctuation of lattice
   potential energy in different matrices and to explain the observed trend
   in activation energies. Greater fluctuation of lattice potential energy
   produces more significant atomic traps and blocks, leading to higher
   activation energies, and thus accounts for the sluggish diffusion in
   high-entropy alloys. (C) 2013 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier

AB Hollow nanostructures are used for various applications including
   catalysis, sensing, and drug delivery. Methods based on the Kirkendall
   effect have been the most successful for obtaining hollow nanostructures
   of various multicomponent systems. The classical Kirkendall effect
   relies on the presence of a faster diffusing species in the core; the
   resultant imbalance in flux results in the formation of hollow
   structures. Here, an alternate non-Kirkendall mechanism that is
   operative for the formation of hollow single crystalline particles of
   intermetallic PtBi is demonstrated. The synthesis method involves
   sequential reduction of Pt and Bi salts in ethylene glycol under
   microwave irradiation. Detailed analysis of the reaction at various
   stages indicates that the formation of the intermetallic PtBi hollow
   nanoparticles occurs in steps. The mechanistic details are elucidated
   using control experiments. The use of microwave results in a very rapid
   synthesis of intermetallics PtBi that exhibits excellent
   electrocatalytic activity for formic acid oxidation reaction. The method
   presented can be extended to various multicomponent systems and is
   independent of the intrinsic diffusivities of the species involved.

AB Most theoretical work on dendrite growth has focused on dilute binary
   alloys, while most industrial alloys are concentrated multicomponent
   systems. By incorporating the local non-equilibrium effects both at the
   interface and in the bulk liquid, the thermodynamic database and
   diffusional interaction, a model was developed for dendrite growth in
   undercooled concentrated multi-component alloys. An experimental study
   of dendrite growth in undercooled Ni-18 at.% Cu-18 at.% Co melts was
   carried out and the measured interface velocities (V) were well
   predicted by the present model over the whole undercooling range (Delta
   T = 30-313 K). During dendrite growth the partition coefficients change
   non-monotonically due to interaction between the species and changes in
   the dendrite tip radius. Interaction between the species also leads to a
   lower interface velocity and larger Delta T and Vas the Delta T-V
   relation plateaus. The previous definition of constitutional
   undercooling, i.e. the sum of the contributions of each solute, is not
   applicable to concentrated multi-component alloys. The controlling
   mechanisms during dendrite growth are discussed with respect to the
   results of the calculations. (C) 2013 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by

AB Creation of multicomponent catalytic systems is the main way to decrease
   the content of or completely replace Pt in fuel cell cathodes. Compared
   to the conventional catalytic systems, production of PtCoCr catalysts on
   different substrates (XC-72 carbon nanotubes, TiO2) differs in
   high-temperature conditions and the use of nitrogen-containing
   transient-metal precursors. According to electrochemical and structural
   studies, during synthesis and subsequent treatment, alloy nanoparticles
   with a core-shell structure enriched in platinum are formed on a carbon
   material doped with nitrogen. The ligand effect of the alloy core
   results in an increase in the electron density of the platinum d-level,
   acceleration of oxygen reduction, and deceleration of water molecule
   discharge and platinum corrosion. A architecture of membrane electrode
   assembly involving PtCoCr-based active layers of varying composition is
   developed for fuel cells operating at a temperature of 65A degrees C in
   hydrogen-air and hydrogen-oxygen environments. In both cases, the use of
   PtCoCr instead of monoplatinum catalysts enabled us to halve the
   platinum consumption at the same discharge current density and specific
   power. The results of life testing and potential cycling of membrane
   electrode assemblies under severe conditions showed that the resistance
   of PtCoCr systems is not inferior to platinum.

AB Precipitate size and number density are two key factors for tailoring
   the mechanical behavior of nanoscale precipitate-hardened alloys.
   However, during thermal aging, the precipitate size and number density
   change, leading to either poor strength or high strength but
   significantly reduced ductility. Here we demonstrate, by producing
   nanoscale co-precipitates in composition-optimized multicomponent
   precipitation-hardened alloys, a unique approach to improve the
   stability of the alloy against thermal aging and hence the mechanical
   properties. Our study provides compelling experimental evidence that
   these nanoscale co-precipitates consist of a Cu-enriched bcc core
   partially encased by a B2-ordered Ni( Mn, Al) phase. This co-precipitate
   provides a more complex obstacle for dislocation movement due to atomic
   ordering together with interphases, resulting in a high yield strength
   alloy without sacrificing alloy ductility.

AB Al, Zr, Ni, Co, Fe and Cr were introduced into a Cu plate using ball
   collisions to fabricate a multicomponent composite layer. The
   application of severe plastic deformation induced by repeated ball
   collisions with the as-fabricated composite layer led to intermixing of
   the components and the formation of a surface alloyed layer on the Cu
   plate. The microstructural development of the surface alloyed layer was
   a function of the treatment time. After 1 h of treatment, an alternating
   laminated amorphous/crystalline composite structure with a mean lamellar
   thickness of 10 nm was formed as a result of the combined effects of the
   deformation-induced plastic flow, inter-diffusion and intermixing of the
   elements. The crystalline lamellae were related to the multicomponent
   non-equilibrium solid solution based on the Cu crystal structure.
   Increase in treatment time to 4 h led to structural changes. The
   crystalline lamellae underwent refinement that was attributed to
   dislocation activity and were subdivided into interlamellar blocks. The
   amorphous lamellae tended to disappear. A body-centered cubic (bcc) Fe
   solid solution was formed in the layer. Nucleation and growth of bcc Fe
   precipices in amorphous and crystalline phases were related to increase
   in Fe content in the layer, which increased with treatment time. The
   hardness of the as-fabricated layer was almost ten times that of the
   initial Cu plate. (C) 2012 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier

AB A therapeutic technology that combines the phototoxic and
   immune-stimulating ability of photodynamic therapy (PDT) with the
   widespread effectiveness of the immune system can be very promising to
   treat metastatic breast cancer. We speculated that the knowledge of
   molecular mechanisms of existing multicomponent therapies could provide
   clues to aid the discovery of new combinations of an immunostimulant
   with a photosensitizer (PS) using a nanoparticle (NP) delivery platform.
   Therapeutic challenges when administering therapeutic combinations
   include the choice of dosages to reduce side effects, the definitive
   delivery of the correct drug ratio, and exposure to the targets of
   interest. These factors are very difficult to achieve when drugs are
   individually administered. By combining controlled release polymer-based
   NP drug delivery approaches, we were able to differentially deliver zinc
   phthalocyanine (ZnPc) based PS to metastatic breast cancer cells along
   with CpG-ODN, a single-stranded DNA that is a known immunostimulant to
   manage the distant tumors in a temporally regulated manner. We
   encapsulated ZnPc which is a long-wavelength absorbing PS within a
   polymeric NP core made up of poly(D,L-lactic-co-glycolic
   acid)-b-poly(ethylene glycol) (PLGA-b-PEG). After coating the outside of
   the polymeric core with gold NPs (AuNPs), we further modified the AuNP
   surface with CpG-ODN. In vitro cytotoxicity using 4T1 metastatic mouse
   breast carcinoma cells shows significant photocytotoxicity of the hybrid
   NPs containing both ZnPc and CpG-ODN after irradiation with a 660 nm
   LASER light and this activity was remarkably better than either
   treatment alone. Treatment of mouse bone marrow derived dendritic cells
   with the PDT-killed 4T1 cell lysate shows that the combination of PDT
   with a synergistic immunostimulant in a single NP system results in
   significant immune response, which can be used for the treatment of
   metastatic cancer.

AB Copper and chromium modified tin oxide nanocomposites were obtained via
   incipient wetness impregnation of high surface area nanosized SnO2 with
   the corresponding metal acetylacetonates and their further decomposition
   in air. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), Nitrogen physisorption, UV-Vis,
   and Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) with hydrogen were applied
   for the samples characterization. The catalytic activity of the obtained
   materials was tested in methanol conversion. A new approach based on the
   selective coverage of the surface with C-11-methanol was used for the
   characterization of the catalytic sites. It was demonstrated that the
   products distribution could be controlled by the surface coverage with
   methanol and the role of different active sites was discussed. The
   modification of SnO2 with copper oxide increased the activity in
   methanol decomposition to CO2 via dioxymethylene intermediates, but the
   catalyst suffered considerable loss of activity due to the reduction
   transformations by the reaction medium and formation of an inactive
   intermetallic alloy. The modification with chromium changed the
   acid-basic properties of SnO2 by the formation of Cr2O3 nanoparticles as
   well as anchored to the support chromate species. The former particles
   facilitated the formation of dimethyl ether (DME), while the latter
   species converted methanol predominantly to hydrocarbons. The fraction
   of chromate species increased in Cu-Cr-Sn oxide multicomponent
   nanocomposites and promoted the formation of hydrocarbons over DME at
   low temperatures, while at higher temperatures, the activity of the
   copper species leading to CO2 formation was more pronounced. (C) 2012

   20at.%) alloys with a diameter of 2 mm have been prepared by suction
   casting. The glass-forming ability(GFA) was characterized by
   differential scanning calorimetry(DSC). The supercooled liquid region
   Delta T-x(=T-x-T-g) and parameter gamma (=T-x/(T-g+T-1)) increase with
   the increasing of the addition element content. The effects of
   equiatomic element on Delta T-x of Y56Al24Co20 alloy arise from the
   increasing of the electronegativity difference Delta x, the atomic size
   parameter delta and the valence electron difference Delta n. The results
   suggest that the GFA of some alloys might be improved by the addition of
   other equiatomic elements substitution for the alloy constituent
   elements.

   components and Boltzmann's solution for diffusion equation with variable
   diffusion coefficient. Using this method the concentration profiles for
   several diffusion couples in the systems Fe-Co-Ni and Cu-Fe-Ni are
   calculated as examples and some peculiarities of these calculations are
   discussed, particularly, how to solve some possible difficulties, which
   may sometimes arise at calculation procedures. It is shown that having
   the data on effective interdiffusion coefficients and their
   concentration dependence for at least two components in a ternary
   diffusion couple, the concentration profiles for all three components
   can be calculated with good accuracy.

AB The reasons are investigated for the prepeak and the asymmetry of the
   second peak in the structure factor curve that are observed in a variety
   of metallic melts. The prepeak is observed as an additional maximum in
   the left wing of the main peak of the structure factor for
   multicomponent melts and is attributed to their chemical short-range
   order (CSRO). The asymmetry of the second peak in the structure factor,
   which is usually explained by the “icosahedral” (polytetrahedral) order
   in the melt, is observed both for multicomponent systems and for pure
   metals. However, some aluminum alloys with transition metals exhibit the
   two features simultaneously, which requires an explanation. An X-ray
   diffraction study of the liquid ternary Al <sub>66.6</sub>Mn
   <sub>16.7</sub>Co <sub>16.7</sub> alloy is performed at 1393 K and that
   of liquid copper at 1353 K, 1403 K, and 1553 K. The reverse Monte Carlo
   (RMC) method is used to derive structural models of these and other
   melts. Structural analysis of these melts is conducted using Delaunay
   simplices. A theoretical simulation of CSRO is performed in the model of
   liquid aluminum, the structure factor of which does not have these
   features. It is discussed that CSRO can exist in a melt regardless of
   the presence of the polytetrahedral order.

   characterization has been performed. The catalyst contained Fe as an
   active component (mono-component Fe catalyst) demonstrates the

   like structure) with their subsequent transformation into stable iron
   carbide Fe3C (cohenite). The active component of bimetal Fe?Co catalysts
   (Fe:Co?=?2:1) is Fe?Co alloyed nanoparticles, which does not demonstrate
   carbide formation. The absence of carbides promotes carbon diffusion
   through metal particle providing much higher activity of bimetal Fe?Co
   catalyst in comparison with the mono-component Fe and Co catalysts.
   Tubes produced using the bimetal catalysts have a high degree of
   structural perfection and narrow diameter distribution. The most active

   Ti-Cu-Fe-Co-Ni high entropy alloys (HEAs) via vacuum arc melting
   technique using non consumable tungsten electrode under high purity Ar
   atmosphere on a water-cooled copper hearth. Ti-Cu-Fe-Co-Ni
   multicomponent alloys with varying Ti/Cu (x) molar ratio (x = 1/3, 3/7,
   3/5, 9/11, 1, 11/9 and 3/2) have been prepared through the tailoring of
   microstructure to get understanding of the phase formation and the
   microstructural evolution of these multicomponent HEAs. X-ray
   diffraction and scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy
   dispersive spectroscopic results confirm the presence of (Cu)(ss),
   (Co)(ss) and (beta-Ti)(ss) dendrites with ultrafine eutectic between
   cubic (Cu)(ss) and Laves phase (Ti2Co type). The solidification pathways
   of novel alloys are critically discussed as follows. For x = 9/11, 1,
   11/9 and 3/2; firstly, (beta-Ti)(ss) dendrite is formed from the liquid,
   followed by the liquid phase separation between the cobalt-rich solid
   solution (Co)(ss) and copper-rich solid solution (Cu)(ss) and finally,
   the remaining liquid undergoes eutectic reaction between copper solid
   solution (Cu)(ss) and the Laves phase (Ti2Co Type), whereas for x = 1/3,
   3/7 and 3/5; (beta-Ti)(ss) dendrite is formed first from the liquid and
   then remaining liquid undergoes the liquid phase separation resulting
   two different dendrites of (Cu)(ss) and (Co)(ss) phases. Detailed
   thermodynamic calculations have been carried to rationalize the
   formation of stable solid solution phases of these newly developed
   multicomponent Ti-Cu-Fe-Co-Ni HEAs.

   and Pd) on the densification of Mo-Si-B alloys of six different
   compositions (Mo, Mo-0.2Si, Mo-0.2Si-0.02B, Mo-2.5Si-2.5B, Mo-7Si-5B,
   and Mo-8.9Si-7.7B at.%) are systematically investigated. It was found
   that Ni, Co, and Fe are effective in enhancing densification of Mo-Si-B
   alloys, and Ni is the most effective sintering aid. This study supports
   a previously proposed hypothesis that activated sintering results from
   enhanced mass transport in the sintering-aid-induced quasi-liquid
   intergranular films (a type of grain boundary complexion). The relative
   effectiveness of these sintering aids can be rationalized by analyzing
   several key thermodynamic parameters that control the stability of
   premelting-like grain boundary complexions. Future studies are needed to
   develop interfacial thermodynamic models and methods for computing
   "grain boundary complexion (phase) diagrams" for multicomponent systems,
   which can be a useful component for the "Materials Genome" project that
   will enable better predictions of the activated sintering and other
   materials phenomena.

   (Ti12.5Zr21V10Cr8.5MnxCo1.5Ni46.5-x) designed to have different
   fractions of Zr-Ni-type secondary phases by varying the Mn/Ni-content
   were studied to establish correlations of these properties with
   abundances of the secondary phases. In the gas charging, the general
   trend of pressure concentration temperature slope factor and hysteresis
   is to diminish with increase in the Zr7Ni10 phase abundance; the trend
   of reversible hydrogen storage capacity is to increase as the
   TiNi-derived AB phase abundance increases. As for the electrochemical
   properties, the number of activation cycles needed to achieve a given
   percentage of capacity and power decreases with increase in the total
   amount of secondary phases. Trends of changes in both the total and
   reversible capacities follow that in AB phase abundance; the evolution
   of high-rate dischargeability, bulk diffusion, and surface exchange
   current is similar to that of Zr7Ni10 phase abundance increase in the
   beginning and decrease afterward as the Mn-content in the alloy
   increases. Other properties, such as metal hydrogen bond strength and
   maximum gaseous phase storage capacity, are predominately dependent on
   the alloys' composition, i.e. the Mn/Ni ratio. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB Basing on actual theoretical approach and experimental results, the
   mechanism of sulphide formation beneath the oxide scale grown on metals
   in SO2-O-2 atmospheres has been described. It has been shown that in
   spite of much lower sulphur partial pressure in the oxidizing atmosphere
   than the dissociation pressure of the sulphide to be formed, the
   sulphidation process takes place beneath the oxide scale. This, at the
   first sight, unexpected behavior results from the fact that sulphur is
   diffusing inwards through the primary oxide scale in the molecular form,
   i.e. SO2 molecules. Reaching thus metal-scale interface, where the
   oxygen partial pressure is very low, virtually equal to the dissociation
   pressure of the oxide forming the scale, SO2 double left right arrow O-2
   + 1/2S(2) equilibrium is shifted to the right, as a result of which the
   partial pressure of sulphur vapor dramatically increases, reaching the
   value several orders of magnitude higher than that needed for sulphide
   formation.
   Analogous situation is observed during oxidation of chromium steels in
   CO2-O-2 atmospheres. In this case, namely, carburisation process is
   observed beneath the oxide scale, in spite of the fact that carbon
   activity in this environment is several order of magnitude lower than
   that required for chromium carbide formation. This again unexpected
   situation becomes understandable if one assumes - like in the case of
   metal oxidation in SO2 containing atmosphere - that carbon is
   transported through the oxide scale in the form of CO2 molecules.
   The final conclusion is, that the explanation of the mechanism of
   sulphide formation beneath the oxide scale on metals and of
   carburization beneath the oxide scales on steels constitutes the
   important step forward, leading to the better understanding of high
   temperature corrosion mechanisms of metallic materials, observed in
   multicomponent agresive gases.

   such as YNi, (Y, Sn)-rich, and Y2O3, and only a small amount being found
   in the main AB(2) phase. The lattice constants and the unit cell volume
   decreased due to the reduction in Zr-content. The C15 phase abundances
   of the Y-containing alloys were higher than those of the Y-free alloys
   in both series. As the Y-content increased, the gaseous phase hydrogen
   storage capacity measured at 30 degrees C decreased in the high-Cr
   series and increased in the high-Co series. Both the hydrogen mid-point
   pressures and the electrochemical discharge capacities of the
   Y-containing alloys were lower than those in the Y-free alloys in both

   the microcapsule comprises a thermo-responsive

   different oil cores can be used as separate compartments for
   co-encapsulation of distinct lipophilic components. The precise
   manipulation of different oil cores afforded by our microfluidic device
   enables the fabrication of microcapsules with select number of each
   core, for optimizing the encapsulation of different lipophilic
   components. Because of the shell shrinking during heating process due to
   the thermo-responsive PNIPAM network, different lipophilic components
   co-encapsulated in the microcapsule can be simultaneously released via
   an external thermal trigger. The thermo-responsive multicompartment
   microcapsule provides an efficient system for co-encapsulation and

PD AUG 29 2012

AB Background: Focused electron beam induced deposition (FEBID) is a
   direct-writing technique with nanometer resolution, which has received
   strongly increasing attention within the last decade. In FEBID a
   precursor previously adsorbed on a substrate surface is dissociated in
   the focus of an electron beam. After 20 years of continuous development
   FEBID has reached a stage at which this technique is now particularly
   attractive for several areas in both, basic and applied research. The
   present topical review addresses selected examples that highlight this
   development in the areas of charge-transport regimes in nanogranular
   metals close to an insulator-to-metal transition, the use of these
   materials for strain- and magnetic-field sensing, and the prospect of
   extending FEBID to multicomponent systems, such as binary alloys and
   intermetallic compounds with cooperative ground states.
   Results: After a brief introduction to the technique, recent work
   concerning FEBID of Pt-Si alloys and (hard-magnetic) Co-Pt intermetallic
   compounds on the nanometer scale is reviewed. The growth process in the
   presence of two precursors, whose flux is independently controlled, is
   analyzed within a continuum model of FEBID that employs rate equations.
   Predictions are made for the tunability of the composition of the Co-Pt
   system by simply changing the dwell time of the electron beam during the
   writing process. The charge-transport regimes of nanogranular metals are
   reviewed next with a focus on recent theoretical advancements in the
   field. As a case study the transport properties of Pt-C nanogranular
   FEBID structures are discussed. It is shown that by means of a
   post-growth electron-irradiation treatment the electronic
   intergrain-coupling strength can be continuously tuned over a wide
   range. This provides unique access to the transport properties of this
   material close to the insulator-to-metal transition. In the last part of
   the review, recent developments in mechanical strain-sensing and the
   detection of small, inhomogeneous magnetic fields by employing
   nanogranular FEBID structures are highlighted.
   Conclusion: FEBID has now reached a state of maturity that allows a
   shift of the focus towards the development of new application fields, be
   it in basic research or applied. This is shown for selected examples in
   the present review. At the same time, when seen from a broader
   perspective, FEBID still has to live up to the original idea of
   providing a tool for electron-controlled chemistry on the nanometer
   scale. This has to be understood in the sense that, by providing a
   suitable environment during the FEBID process, the outcome of the
   electron-induced reactions can be steered in a controlled way towards
   yielding the desired composition of the products. The development of a
   FEBID-specialized surface chemistry is mostly still in its infancy. Next
   to application development, it is this aspect that will likely be a
   guiding light for the future development of the field of focused
   electron beam induced deposition.

   atmosphere with the application of different substrate biases. All the
   (AlCrTaTiZr)NCy coatings deposited in different conditions exhibited a

   graphite-target power increased, the (AlCrTaTiZr)NCy coatings
   transformed from a large columnar structure with a [111] preferred
   orientation to a dense, ultrafine nanocomposite structure. With
   increasing substrate bias and graphite-target power, the hardness, H/E
   ratio and H-3/E-2 ratio of the coatings increased from 20 to 35 GPa,
   from 0.07 to 0.12 and from 0.10 to 0.43 GPa, respectively, attributed to
   the densification of the coatings, the refinement of grains, the
   introduction of covalent-like carbide bonds, the formation of
   nanocomposite structure and the existence of large lattice distortions.
   Because of the severe distortions in the multi-component coatings caused
   by the addition of differently-sized atoms, the deformation mechanism
   was dominated by the activity of low-angle dislocations and/or stacking
   faults. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Multicomponent Co40Fe22Ta8B30 powders were synthesized by mechanical
   alloying (MA) of the elemental powder mixture. The microstructure of the
   powders at the initial stage of milling mainly consists of
   nanocrystalline bcc-(Fe,Co) phase and unreacted tantalum along with a
   minor amount of amorphous phase. The amorphous phase becomes the
   dominant phase with the progression of the MA process, reaching a weight
   fraction of similar to 96% after milling for 200 h. Thermal and
   structural analysis reveals that the amorphous phase crystallizes
   through a single crystallization event to form the metastable complex
   fcc (Fe,Co,Ta)(23)B-6 and the (Co,Fe)(3)B-2 phases. The magnetic
   measurements show that the saturation magnetization of the powders
   decreases continuously with increasing the milling time. On the other
   hand, the coercivity and the squareness ratio of the hysteresis loop
   first increase and after milling for 22 h they decrease continuously.
   The evolution of the coercivity with milling time is discussed with
   respect to different phenomena, such as residual stress, grain
   refinement, amorphous phase formation, surface anisotropy and particles
   surface irregularities. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   superalloys used in gas turbine applications at high temperatures (1473
   K [1200 A degrees C] bare metal temperature). Unlike other commercial
   Co-based alloys, the Co matrix in the Co-Re alloys has a stable
   hexagonal close-packed (hcp) structure at room temperature. In situ
   neutron diffraction measurements on experimental Co-Re alloys hardened
   by carbide precipitates showed that the matrix undergoes an hcp a double
   dagger dagger face-centered cubic (fcc) allotropic transformation after
   heating to high temperatures. Furthermore, it was found that this
   transformation has a large hysteresis (similar to 100 K). Thermodynamic
   calculations were undertaken to study the high-temperature phase
   stability and transformations in the complex multicomponent, multiphase
   Co-Re-Cr-C system with or without the addition of Ta. The results show
   that the minor phases (Cr23C6-type carbides and the Cr2Re3-type sigma
   phase) play an important role in the hcp a double dagger dagger fcc
   hysteresis by influencing the partitioning of Cr and Re between the
   matrix and the other phases.

   ceramic. Composition variation in both metal and ceramic phases with
   distance along the direction of diffusion is achieved. The design
   criteria for developing such composites are discussed. The system should
   exhibit extensive solid solubility in both metallic and ceramic phases,
   a defined gradation in the stabilities of the oxides, and mobility of
   electrons or holes in the oxide solid solution. The complex ceramic used
   for making the composite should be polycrystalline with sufficient
   porosity to accommodate the volume expansion caused by alloy
   precipitation. An inert atmosphere to prevent oxidation and high
   processing temperature to facilitate diffusive transport are required.

   structures of a series of partial-Ni substituted Zr8Ni21 alloys,
   potential metal hydride candidates for high-rate nickel/metal hydride
   batteries, were studied. The substitution elements included Mg, Al, Sc,
   V, Mn, Co, Sn, La, and Hf. Only the main phase of the annealed
   Sn-substitution remained Zr8Ni21-structured while those of other
   substitutions turned into Zr7Ni10 or Zr2Ni7. Similar to the preference
   of C14/C15 main phase in AB(2) alloys, the number of outer-shell
   electrons played an important role in determining the main phase of the
   A(8)B(21) alloys. As the number of outer-shell electrons of the
   substituting element increased, the main phase evolved from tetragonal
   Zr7Ni10 (Mg, Al, and Sc), to orthorhombic Zr7Ni10 (La and Hf), cubic
   Zr2Ni7 (V, Mn, Co, and Sn (before annealing)), and finally triclinic
   Zr8Ni21 (Ni and Sn (after annealing)). After annealing, the abundance of
   the predominant phase increased, and the number of secondary phases
   diminished. The only exception was the Sn-substituted alloy, where the
   major phase transformed from Zr2Ni7 to Zr8Ni21 (after annealing). In
   this study, several alloys showed an X-ray diffraction peak at around

   tolerance of the Pt-Ru-Fe ternary alloy catalysts was derived from the
   reaction between the high mobility, weakly adsorbed CO on the Pt site
   that was electronically modified by alloying with Fe and adsorbed water
   species on the Ru site. This combination of features produced an
   improvement in the electro-oxidation of CO/H-2 and methanol at lower
   potential. On the basis of the data, it was proposed that the addition
   of a water activator such as Ru is indispensible in the design of
   multicomponent alloy catalysts for methanol oxidation, and the
   additional effect derived from an electronic modifier is an important
   factor for improving the CO and methanol oxidation activity of the
   catalyst containing the water activator.

AB By investigating the magnetization variation of Fe-rich multicomponent
   alloys with solute concentration, the magnetic flux density of Si
   electrical steel is optimized with average valency. For binary alloys of
   Fe-X [X = d-5d transition-metal (TM) and 3sp-6sp elements], the usual
   mountain-shape behavior of the Slater-Pauling curve is produced even for
   late 4d-5d TM, and the monotonically decreasing behavior for 3sp-5sp
   elements. Anomalously, a rise-and-fall pattern is found for the 6sp
   element of X = Bi. For ternary alloys of Fe-Si-X (X = 3d-5d TM and
   3sp-6sp elements), the role of Si is shown to shift the starting point
   of moment variation and the magnetic flux density of Fe-Si-X alloys is
   found to repeat the Si-absent binary pattern at the shifted reference
   moment. On the basis of the calculated magnetic moments, Fe-Si-X-Y (X =
   Co, Pd, Pt and Y = Al, Sb, Bi) is proposed as a viable candidate for the
   optimum products of electrical steels.

   Effects of substrate type, substrate pre-heating and heat treatment of

   accordance with ASTM G-65. Furthermore, influence of heat treatment of
   coating on wear mechanisms was also determined by scanning electron

   times lower than as-sprayed coatings. Furthermore, wear mechanisms of
   as-sprayed coating are micro-cutting associated with cracks close to
   unmelted particles and pores. In heat-treated coating, lesser mass loss
   is due to sintering. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB High-speed steels have been used mostly for multi-point cutting tools
   and for plastic working tools. High speed steels are ferrous based
   alloys of the Fe-C-X multi-component system where X represents a group
   of alloying elements comprising mainly Cr, W or Mo, V, and Co. The
   properties of these steels can be improved by modifying their chemical
   composition or the technology of their production. One of the new trends
   in modifying the tool steels chemical composition consists in the
   addition of niobium and nitrogen. In this work, the effects of niobium
   and nitrogen on morphology of carbides and secondary hardening
   temperature of investigated high speed tool steels were studied. This
   experimental work shows that, the conventional ingots have many types of
   carbides of different shapes and sizes precipitate on the boundary
   together with thick needle like carbides. On the contrary, for nitrogen
   steel, the nitrogen alloying leads to form dense, fine and well
   distributed microstructure. While, on the case of niobium alloying,
   single carbide (MC), and different types of eutectic carbides were
   precipitated which have a major effect on the secondary hardening
   temperature.

AB Integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) with CO2 capture and
   sequestration (CCS) offers a promising approach for cleanly using
   abundant coal reserves of the world to generate electricity. The present
   state-of-the-art synthesis gas (syngas) cleanup technologies in IGCC
   involve cooling the syngas from the gasifier to room temperature or
   lower for removing sulfur, carbon dioxide, and other pollutants, leading
   to a large efficiency loss. Here we assess the suitability of various
   alternative syngas cleanup technologies for IGCC with CCS through
   computational simulations. We model multicomponent gas separation for
   CO2 capture in IGCC using polymeric membranes and H-2 separation from
   the syngas using both Pd-alloy based composite metallic membranes and
   polymeric membranes. In addition, we develop a pressure swing adsorption
   model to estimate the energy efficiency of regenerable sorbent beds for
   CO2 capture. We use our models with Aspen Plus simulations to identify
   promising design and operating conditions for membrane and adsorption
   processes in an IGCC plant. On the basis of our analysis, the benefits
   of warm gas cleanup are not as great as previously reported in the
   literature, and only CO2 separations performed using H-2-permeable
   Pd-alloy membranes and CO2 adsorbents produce overall higher heating
   value (HHV) efficiencies higher than that of Selexol. In addition, many
   of the technologies surveyed require a narrow operating range of process
   parameters in order to be viable alternatives. We identify desired
   material properties of membranes and thermodynamic properties of
   sorbents that are needed to make these technologies successful,
   providing direction for ongoing experimental efforts to develop these
   materials.

   were investigated with temperature-resolved synchrotron small angle
   X-ray scattering (SAXS), differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) and
   polarized optical microscopy (POM) methods. We have observed two
   crystallization peaks (fractionated crystallization behavior) during
   cooling process in N-iPP/PEOc in-reactor alloy. We also determined that
   the crystallinities from that two crystallization peaks were dependent
   on liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) time with t(0.10) and t(-0.28),
   respectively. It was explained that the fractionated crystallization
   behavior in the N-iPP/PEOc in-reactor alloy system was caused by crystal
   nucleation occurring in the iPP rich domain by heterogeneous nucleation
   and at interface of iPP and PEOc rich domains by the fluctuation
   assisted nucleation. The fluctuation assisted nucleation only occurred
   at interface of iPP and PEOc domains by concentration fluctuation
   through the coupling of liquid-liquid spinodal decomposition and the
   cross-over to crystal nucleation process. Both lamellar crystals
   formations from heterogeneous and fluctuation assisted nucleation in
   N-iPP/PEOc were probed by temperature-resolved SAXS during cooling
   process. Our results provide the physical model for the multiple
   nucleation and crystal growth mechanisms in the multicomponent,

AB Hydrogen sorption properties of a large variety of solid solutions on
   the base of ZrCr2 and TiFe2 intermetallic compounds are studied at
   pressures up to 300 MPa. Partial substitution of Cr by small amounts of
   Me = Al, Mn, Mo, Ni and B does not significantly change the H/M ratio of
   hydrides of the Ti(Cr1-xMex)(2-a) alloys with 0 < a < 0.2, whereas the
   substitution by Me = Si results in a steep decrease of this ratio. An
   increase in the concentration of the substituting metal inhibits the
   transformation of the studied hydrides from the initial Laves phase to a
   CaF2-type structure with increasing hydrogen pressure at a temperature
   of -50 degrees C. In the case of the ZrFe2 compound, substituting Zr by
   Dy and Y, and also substituting Fe by V, Cr, Mn, Ni, Cu and Mo decrease
   the equilibrium absorption and desorption pressures, unlike Ti
   substitution for Zr and Co substitution for Fe. Substituting Zr by Dy, Y
   and Ti, as well as substituting Fe by V, Cr, Ni and Cu decrease the
   hysteresis between the formation and decomposition pressures of the
   hydrides. In the case of Zr1-xTix(Fe1-yMey)(2) multicomponent alloys

AB A series of Fe-substituting cobalt C14-predoninating AB(2) alloys with
   the general formula Ti12Zr21.5V10Cr7.5Mn8.1FexCo8-xNi32.2Sn0.3Al0.4 (X =
   0-5) were studied for the impacts of Fe to structure, gaseous, and
   electrochemical hydrogen storage properties. All alloys exhibit
   hyper-stoichiometric C14 main phase due to the formation of A-rich
   non-Laves secondary phases and the loss of Zr and Ti in the melt.
   Lattice parameters together with the unit cell volume increases and then
   decreases with increasing Fe-content which indicates the existence of
   anti-site defects. The amount of TiNi secondary phase increases with the
   increase of Fe-content up to 4% and shows a detrimental effect to the
   high-rate dischargeability of the alloys. Most of the gaseous storage
   characteristics remain unchanged with the addition of Fe. In the
   electrochemical properties, Fe-addition in the AB(2) alloys facilitates
   activation, increases the total electrochemical capacity and effective
   surface reaction area, decreases the half-cell high-rate
   dischargeability and bulk hydrogen diffusion, and deteriorates both -10
   and -40 degrees C low-temperature performance. Fe-substituting Co in
   AB(2) alloys as negative electrode of nickel metal hydride battery can
   reduce the raw material cost with the trade-off being mainly in the
   low-temperature performance. Copyright (C) 2011, Hydrogen Energy

   conducted to examine the interdiffusion process in Ni-Pt and Co-Pt
   binary alloy systems. Inter-, intrinsic-, and tracer-diffusion
   coefficients at different temperatures, and as a function of the
   composition, were estimated by using the experimental data. Results show
   that in both the alloy systems, Pt is the slower diffusing species, and
   hence the interdiffusion process is controlled by either Ni or Co. The
   thermodynamic driving force makes the intrinsic diffusion coefficients
   of Co and Ni higher in the range of 30-70 at.%. The low activation
   energy for Co and Ni impurity diffusion in Pt compared with Pt in Ni and
   Co indicates that the size of the atoms plays an important role. The
   vacancy wind effects on the diffusion process are examined in detail,
   and it was demonstrated that its contribution falls within the
   experimental scatter and hence can be neglected.

AB The structures and electrochemical properties of a series of annealed
   AB(5), La10.5Ce4.3Pr0.5Nd1.4Ni64.3-xCo5.0Mn4.6Al6.0Cu3.2Zr0.2Fex (x =
   0.0, 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5), metal hydride alloys were studied for
   improvement in the low-temperature performance of nickel/metal hydride
   batteries. As the Fe-content in the alloy increases, the following was
   observed: lattice constant a first increases and then decreases; lattice
   constant c and c/a ratio increase; unit cell volume increases
   monotonically; the main AB(5) phase becomes hyper-stoichiometric
   containing no Zr and its Fe-content is close to the target composition;
   an additional AB(7) phase appears; maximum gaseous hydrogen storage, PCT
   plateau pressure, and hysteresis first increase and then decrease while
   the trend of reversible hydrogen storage is the opposite; enthalpy and
   entropy of hydride formation remain unchanged; electrochemical full
   capacity decreases while the high-rate dischargeability and surface
   reaction exchange current increase; and bulk hydrogen diffusion
   increases first and then decreases by very small amounts. The product of
   charge-transfer resistance and double-layer capacitance measured at -40
   degrees C indicates an improvement in the surface catalysis with
   Fe-addition. In the sealed cell, the addition of Fe improves both the
   specific power and -10 degrees C low temperature performance, slightly
   reduces the charge retention, and first marginally improves and then
   deteriorates the cycle life performance. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All

AB Interdiffusion and impurity diffusion of Ge is studied in Ni and
   multicomponent alloys over the temperature range of 1150-1250 degrees C.
   The diffusion is investigated using diffusion couples, which are
   evaluated using microprobe measurements. The interdiffusion coefficients
   are calculated with the den Broeder method, while the impurity diffusion
   coefficients are determined with the Hall method. A model for the
   diffusion simulation software DICTRA is developed by mobility
   assessments. Further on, the diffusion of Ge in the multicomponent
   superalloys PWA1483 and Rene N5 is investigated. The Ge diffusion
   coefficient in Rene N5 is 4.5x10(-14) m(2)/s at 1180 degrees C which is
   similar to other alloying elements such as Co, Cr, Mo or Ta.

AB Detonation spraying is a well-known technology which is applied for
   deposition of diverse powders, in particular cermets, to form various
   protective coatings. Actual progress is related to a recently developed
   technique of computer-controlled detonation spraying and its application
   in non-traditional domains as development of composite and graded
   coatings or metallization of plastics. The gas detonation parameters are
   analyzed to estimate the efficiency of different fuels to vary
   particle-in-flight velocity and temperature over a broad range thus
   providing conditions to spray diverse powders. A particle of a given
   nature and fixed size could be sprayed in a solid state or being
   strongly overheated above the melting point by variation of the quantity
   of the explosive gas mixture which is computer-controlled.
   Particle-in-flight velocity and temperature are calculated and compared
   with jet monitoring by a CCD-camera-based diagnostic tool and
   experimental data on splats formation.

AB The present study uses the mechanical alloying method to produce series
   of binary to senary alloys based on Ni, Co, Al, Fe, Cu, Cr. Milling
   times are 0, 10, 20 and 30 h and experiments are performed in a high
   energy ball mill. The results of this investigation show that an FCC
   solid solution is formed in all the studied systems, but a different
   phase formation response is presented in each system. A mixture of FCC
   and BCC solid solutions in quaternary to senary systems, is formed for
   short milling times. Apparently, the dissolution rate of Fe and Cr into
   the FCC solid solution, is low. Moreover, it is observed that additions
   of these elements promote the formation of BCC solid solution, which is
   stable at temperatures up to -1273 K. Finally, it is observed that the
   heat treated products present a mixture of FCC and BCC solid solutions
   with lattice parameters close to those found in the milled products. (C)

   by AlCrTaTiZr/C co-sputtering in an N-2/Ar mixed atmosphere under an
   AlCrTaTiZr-alloy-target power of 150 W and different C-target powers
   (0-200 W). At a C-target power of 0 W, an (AlCrTaTiZr)N-0.6 coating with
   a face-centered cubic solid-solution structure was deposited and
   exhibited a large columnar structure; its hardness and steady-stage
   creep strain rate were measured as about 20 GPa and 1.5 x 10(-4) 1/s,
   respectively. By applying a C-target power of 100 W, an
   (AlCrTaTiZr)N0.6C0.2 coating was formed with a fine columnar structure.
   Owing to the incorporated C atoms, the (111) interplanar spacing of the
   face-centered cubic structure was increased from 0.249 to 0.253 nm. The
   hardness increased to 32 GPa and the creep strain rate was lowered to
   1.1 x 10(-4) 1/s attributed to the introduction of covalent-like bonds,
   grain refinement and the formation of an amorphous-like and
   nanocomposite structure. Furthermore, under a C-target power of 200 W,
   excess C atoms agglomerated to form clusters in the deposited
   (AlCrTaTiZr) N0.6C0.4 coating. Consequently, the hardness slightly
   decreased to 30 GPa and the creep strain rate increased to 2.4 x 10(-4)
   1/s. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Multicomponent compatibilized blends of polyamide 6 (PA6) and
   styrene-butadiene-acrylonitrile (ABS) with co-continuous morphology are
   among commercial alloys with an interesting combination of properties.
   To further enhance the properties different amounts of nanoclay were
   incorporated into these blends through a one step melt mixing process.
   The effect of nanoclay addition on rheological, thermal stability,
   crystallization and morphological properties of the nanocomposites were
   investigated and compared with those of the neat blends. The nanoscale
   dispersion of the clay layers in the blends were confirmed through X-ray
   diffraction and transmission electron microscopy methods. Rheological
   investigation indicated an increased viscosity and melt elasticity for
   the nanocomposite systems. The viscosity of nanocomposites followed a
   shear thinning flow behavior and decreased with increasing shear rates.
   The changes in the rheological properties were accompanied by refinement
   of the co-continuous morphology. For thermal degradation under N-2
   atmosphere, the onset and maximum of degradation temperatures for the
   nanocomposites were as high as the neat blends, while significant
   improvement in thermal stability (about 60 A degrees C by 3 wt% clay
   addition) was observed in the air environment. In addition agglomerated
   clay particles did not significantly affect thermal stability of the
   polymer matrix. Non-isothermal crystallization results indicated that
   the clay layers had a retarding effect on the crystal growth rate and
   facilitated the formation of alpha crystalline form. In addition no
   nucleation effect was observed during the crystallization process due to
   incorporation of nanoclay into the blends.

AB The reaction between Fe foil and a disc of ilmenite solid solution
   (Co-0.48 Ni-0.52) TiO3 was studied at 1273 K. At the metal/oxide
   interface, the displacement reaction, Fe + (Co,Mg)TiO3 = Co +
   (Fe,Mg)TiO3 occurs, resulting in an ilmenite solid solution containing
   three divalent cations. Ferrous ions diffuse into the oxide solid
   solution and cause the precipitation of Co-Fe alloy as discrete
   particles inside the oxide matrix. The morphology of the product layer
   was characterized by SEM. Only two phases, alloy and ilmenite, were
   detected in the reaction zone. This suggests that the local flux
   condition imposed by ilmenite stoichiometry [(Co + Fe + Mg):Ti = 1:1]
   was satisfied during the reactive diffusion: (J(Co) + J(Fe) + J(Mg)) =
   J(Ti). The composition of the alloy and the oxide was determined using
   EPMA as a function of distance in the direction of diffusion. Although
   Mg does not participate in the displacement reaction, its composition in
   the ilmenite phase was found to be position dependent inside the
   reaction zone. The up-hill diffusion of inert Mg is caused by the
   development of chemical potential gradients as a result of displacement
   reaction. The evolution of composition gradients inside the reaction
   zone and the diffusion path in a ternary composition diagram of the
   system CoTiO3-FeTiO3-MgTiO3 are discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All

   relative small percentages, the relative abundances of these minor
   phases were obtained through smoothing, curve fitting, and area
   integration and correlated qualitatively to the amount of additives in
   the alloys. In the Laves phases, Sn, Co, and Fe with more outer-shell
   electrons than that of the host alloy promote C15 phase. Al, with less
   outer-shell electrons, on the other hand, promotes C14 phase. In the AB
   phases, Sn promotes the formation of ZrNi phase and suppresses the
   formation of TiNi phase. In the competition between Zr7Ni10 and Zr9Ni11
   (both are the products from a solid-state transformation). Sn promotes
   Zr7Ni10 while both Fe and Al promote Zr9Ni11. The phase abundances were
   further correlated to the gas phase and electrochemical properties of
   the alloys. C14. Zr9Ni11, and TiNi phases were found to increase both
   the gas phase and electrochemical storage capacities, lower the hydrogen
   equilibrium pressure, decrease the half-cell high-rate dischargeability,
   improve both charge retention and cycle life, and slightly decrease the
   capacity recovery after storing at 45 degrees C for 60 days. C15, ZrNi,
   and Zr7Ni10 phases work in the opposite manner. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB Integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) with CO2 capture and
   sequestration (CCS) offers a promising approach for cleanly using
   abundant coal reserves of the world to generate electricity. The present
   state-of-the-art synthesis gas (syngas) cleanup technologies in IGCC
   involve cooling the syngas from the gasifier to room temperature or
   lower for removing sulfur, carbon dioxide, and other pollutants, leading
   to a large efficiency loss. Here we assess the suitability of various
   alternative syngas cleanup technologies for IGCC with CCS through
   computational simulations. We model multicomponent gas separation for
   CO2 capture in IGCC using polymeric membranes and H2 separation from the
   syngas using both Pd-alloy based composite metallic membranes and
   polymeric membranes. In addition, we develop a pressure swing adsorption
   model to estimate the energy efficiency of regenerable sorbent beds for
   CO2 capture. We use our models with Aspen Plus simulations to identify
   promising design and operating conditions for membrane and adsorption
   processes in an IGCC plant. On the basis of our analysis, the benefits
   of warm gas cleanup are not as great as previously reported in the
   literature, and only CO2 separations performed using H2-permeable
   Pd-alloy membranes and CO2 adsorbents produce overall higher heating
   value (HHV) efficiencies higher than that of Selexol. In addition, many
   of the technologies surveyed require a narrow operating range of process
   parameters in order to be viable alternatives. We identify desired
   material properties of membranes and thermodynamic properties of
   sorbents that are needed to make these technologies successful,
   providing direction for ongoing experimental efforts to develop these
   materials. Copyright: CC BY-NC

AB Nanoporous structures are widely used for many applications and hence
   there have been several efforts directed towards their synthesis. While
   several template-based and template-less approaches are available for
   monometallic systems, there is no general method for the synthesis of
   nanoporous multicomponent systems/alloys. We present a general
   template-less strategy for the synthesis of nanoporous alloy aggregates
   by controlled aggregation of nanoparticles in the solution phase with
   excellent control over morphology and composition as illustrated using
   AuPt, AuPd, PdPt and PtRu systems as examples. The Pt-based nanoporous
   clusters exhibit excellent activity for methanol oxidation with good
   long-term stability and CO tolerance. We show that the method can be
   extended to produce ternary catalysts and hence we expect our method to
   be widely used for the synthesis of multifunctional nanoporous
   structures for catalysis, sensor and drug-delivery applications.

AB The magnetic, magnetocaloric, and magnetoelastic properties of
   TbxDyyRz(Co,Fe)(2) (R = Ho, Er; x + y + z = 1) single-phase alloys
   prepared by arc melting were investigated. The high-purity samples with
   various compositions were used for the study, and a comprehensive
   investigation of the properties was performed. The measurements of the
   magnetocaloric effect (MCE) were carried out by a direct method; and the
   magnetostriction was determined using the strain-gauge technique. In the
   vicinity of the magnetic phase transition, an abrupt change of the
   magnetization, a large MCE, and the maxima of volume magnetostriction
   were observed for the compounds studied. Obtained results of MCE in
   (Tb,Dy)Co-2 agree well with available theoretical calculations.

AB Based on the available experimental data, the Bi-Ni binary system was
   optimized thermodynamically by the CALPHAD method. The solution phases,
   including liquid, fcc_A1(Ni) and rhombohedral_A7(Bi), were described as
   substitutional solution phases, of which the excess Gibbs energies were
   expressed with the Redlich-Kister polynomial. The intermetallic
   compound, BiNi, was modeled using three sublattices (Bi)(Ni, Va)(Ni, Va)
   considering its crystal structure (NiAs-type) and the compatibility of
   thermodynamic database in the multi-component systems, while Bi3Ni was
   treated as a stoichiometric compound. Finally, a set of self-consistent
   thermodynamic parameters formulating the Gibbs energies of various
   phases in this binary system were obtained. The calculated results are
   in reasonable agreement with the reported experimental data.

   from 3 to 9 wt% independently were employed and effect of Cr and V
   contents on the behavior of continuous cooling transformation (CCT) was
   investigated.
   When the Cr content increases to 5wt%, the critical cooling rate of
   pearlite transformation (VC-P) does not change much, but the VC-P
   decreases gradually as the Cr content is increased over 5 wt%. The
   critical cooling rate of bainite transformation (VC-B) increases with an
   increase in the Cr content. In the case of V effect, on the other hand,
   the VC-P decreases as the V content increases. However, the VC-B
   decreases with an increase in the V content up to 4mass%, but over
   4wt%V, it increases, and at 9wt%V, the precipitation of ferrite phase
   occurred.
   Ms temperature decreases continuously as the Cr content increases to
   5wt%, and then increases. As the V content increases, Ms temperature
   rises gradually. In the case that Mf point appears, the Mf temperature
   goes up with an increase in the Cr and V contents.

AB The traditional methods for predicting the occurrence of deleterious
   topologically close-packed (TCP) phases in Ni-based superalloys have
   been based on the PHACOMP and newPHACOMP methodologies. These schemes
   use the average number of holes (N) over bar (h) or the centre of
   gravity of the elemental d-bands (M) over bard to predict whether or not
   a given multicomponent alloy will be prone to TCP formation. However, as
   both these one-dimensional methodologies are well-known to fail with
   respect to new generations of alloys, a novel two-dimensional structure
   map ((N) over bar, (Delta V/V) over bar) is introduced where N is the
   average electron concentration and (Delta V/V) over bar is a
   composition-dependent size-factor difference. This map is found to
   separate the experimental data on the TCP phases of binary A-B
   transition metal alloys into well-defined but sometimes overlapping
   regions corresponding to different structure types such as A15, sigma,
   chi, R, P, delta, mu, M and Laves. Detailed investigations of ternary
   phase diagrams and multicomponent systems show that TCP phases,
   regardless of the number of constituents, are located in the same
   regions of the structure map that are favoured by the binary compounds
   of the same structure type. The structure map is then used in
   conjunction with CALPHAD computations of sigma phase stability to show
   that the predictive power of newPHACOMP for the seven component
   Ni-Co-Cr-Ta-W-Re-Al system studied recently by Reed et al. [24] is
   indeed poor. This supports a growing consensus that robust methods of
   TCP phase prediction in multicomponent alloys will require the inclusion
   of reliable first-principles thermodynamic databases within the
   semi-empirical CALPHAD scheme. (C) 2010 Acta Materialia Inc. Published

AB Composition formulae for ideal metallic glasses are explored by
   combining the cluster-plus-glue-atom model with the global resonance
   model, termed the cluster-resonance model for short. The former model
   gives the [cluster](1)(glue atom)(x) cluster formulae, stressing the
   local cluster order of a glassy structure; the latter model extends the
   local cluster order to a medium-range one by introducing spherical
   periodicity that relates the cluster size with Fermi vector, k(F). Such
   a correlation allows the calculation of Fermi energy, E-F, and
   electrochemical potential of electrons of the system from any local
   clusters. The cluster-resonance model also implies the equilibrium of
   the electrochemical potentials of electrons between different clusters
   so that the number of glue atoms matching one cluster (x in the cluster
   formula) can be determined. Examples in the Cu-Zr-Al and B-Co-Si-Ta
   systems are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed model and
   the resulting cluster formulae in interpreting multi-component
   metallic-glass compositions as well as their relevant binary eutectic
   points.

   agent and sacrificial template in water. These novel alloy-Au hybrid
   nanorings are well biocompatible due to coating with
   poly(vinylpyrrolidone) and gold nanoparticles. When increasing the molar
   ratio of alloy to gold salt from 1:1 to 5:1, the number of the gold
   nanoparticles loaded on the surface of alloy nanorings were found to be
   decreased, and their morphology was transformed from rod to particle,
   remaining the ring-like assemblies. Their saturation magnetization
   increased due to the ring-like assemblies, resulting in the enhancement
   of the signal intensity in Spin-spin relaxation time (T-2) weighted
   magnetic resonance imaging measurement. These alloy-Au hybrid

AB The C14/C15 phase abundance is an important parameter in the design of a
   suitable AB(2)-based metal hydride electrode for use in nickel metal
   hydride batteries. In order to separate the contribution due to chemical
   composition from that of phase abundance, three multi-phase and
   multi-element AB(2) alloys with different C14/C15 phase abundances
   before and after annealing were studied by scanning electron microscope,
   transmission electron microscope, X-ray diffraction,
   pressure-concentration isotherm, half-cell, and full-cell measurements.
   After annealing at 800 degrees C for 14 h, the C14 phase abundances
   increased from 71 to 94% for the first alloy
   (Ti12Zr21.5V10Ni40.2Co1.5Cr8.5Mn5.6Al0.4Sn0.3), remained unchanged at
   about 50% for the second alloy
   (Ti12Zr21.5V10Ni40.2Co5.0Cr5.5Mn5.1Al0.4Sn0.3), and decreased from 32 to
   7% for the third alloy (Ti12Zr21.5V10Ni40.2Co8.0Cr3.5Mn4.1Al0.4Sn0.3).
   The effect of reduction in the amount of non-Laves ZrxNiy secondary
   phases by annealing was established with the second alloy while the
   contribution of additional major phase (either C14 or C15) by annealing
   can be distilled by comparing various properties between samples before
   and after annealing. After the comparison, C15 structure was found to
   have a higher hydrogen storage capacity and higher reversibility in gas
   phase hydrogen storage, and better high-rate dischargeability, hydrogen
   bulk diffusion, specific power, and low temperature performance with a
   shortcoming of an inferior cycle life in electrochemistry. Results from
   gas phase hydrogen storage measurement also agree with those from
   electrochemical testing. Besides, the non-Laves ZrxNiy secondary phases
   are found to play importance roles in the reversibility of hydrogen
   storage in the gas phase and battery performance in activation, rate
   capability, charge retention, and cycle life. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All

   Self-assembly techniques provide relevant control over NP size
   distribution (down to a few nanometers in diameter), but more
   importantly, such techniques are amenable for practical applications
   since the resulting NPs (and arrays thereof) are programmed in the
   molecular structure of the precursors. Here, the diblock copolymer
   micelle nanolithography concept of achieving monodisperse NPs is
   extended to direct the synthesis of multicomponent core shell NPs
   arranged in a triangular lattice. Special emphasis is set on
   Co(core)@Fe(shell) and corrosion resistant (FeCo)(core)@Au(shell) NPS.

AB Solidification microstructure of multicomponent (Zr,Ti)-Ni-(V,Cr,Mn,Co)
   alloys intended for use as negative electrodes in Ni-metal hydride
   (Ni-MH) batteries was studied in Part I of this series of articles. Part
   II of the series examines the complex internal structure of the
   interdendritic grains formed by solid-state transformation and believed
   to play an important role in the electrochemical charge/discharge
   characteristics of the overall alloy composition. By studying one alloy,
   Zr21Ti12.5V10Cr5.5Mn5.1Co5.0Ni40.2Al0.5Sn0.3, it is shown that the
   interdendritic grains solidify as a B2 (Ti,Zr)(44)(Ni,TM)(56) phase, and
   then undergo transformation to Zr7Ni10-type, Zr9Ni11-type, and
   martensitic phases. The transformations obey orientation relationships
   between the high-temperature B2 phase and the low-temperature Zr-Ni-type
   intermetallics, and consequently lead to a multivariant structure. The
   major orientation relationship for the orthorhombic Zr7Ni10 type is
   [011](Zr7Ni10)//[001](B2); (100)(Zr7Ni10)//(100)(B2). The orientation
   relationship for the tetragonal Zr9Ni11 type is
   [001](Zr9Ni11)//[001](B2); (130)(Zr9Ni11)//(100)(B2). Binary Ni-Zr and
   ternary Ti-Ni-Zr phase diagrams were used to rationalize the formation
   of the observed domain structure.

AB Sn-based, multicomponent composites have instilled new life in the

   anode materials with different amounts of carbon were synthesized by
   carbothermal reduction method, carbon component was in situ remained.
   This approach is simple and mass-productive. The effects of carbon
   component on the properties of CoSn2Cx were investigated with the help
   of X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and
   galvanostatic cycling tests. Carbon can prevent the alloy particles from
   agglomeration and thus decrease the alloy average particle size
   dispersing in carbon matrix. Carbon addition improves the cycling
   stability of Co-Sn-C composite electrode, but decreases its specific
   capacity. The incorporation of carbon improves the rate-capability of
   Co-Sn-C composite remarkably. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   Co-substitutions favored the C15 structure Average electron density was
   found to have a determining role in the predilection toward C14/C15
   phases As the NI-content in the alloy decreases, the structure of
   non-Laves phase changes from Zr7Ni10 to Zr7Ni10 + Zr9Ni11, then to
   Zr9Ni11, and finally to Zr9Ni11 + ZrNi. The solubilities of V and Cr in

AB The present work has been undertaken to improve the thermal stability of
   an RhPt-NaTi/Al2O3 catalyst, which is one of promising lean NOx trap
   catalysts for practical NOx conversion. For this purpose, we mainly
   directed our attention to the component of Na that acts as NOx trapping
   sites and intended to improve the thermal stability of this Na species
   by using various additives. After screening of various RhPt-Na
   alpha/Al2O3 (alpha = Ti, Si, Mg, Ca, Mn, Co, Ni, La, and Nd) catalysts,
   Mn addition was found to be effective for improving thermal stability of
   the catalyst. Moreover, the modification of Al2O3 support with Ce
   additive was indicated to be effective, and the most active and
   thermally stable catalyst was RhPt-NaMn-Ce/Al2O3, which was able to
   function actively even after a severe heat treatment at 800 degrees C.
   The reasons for the high thermal stability of this catalyst were
   examined by evaluating NO oxidation activity of a model catalyst
   including Mn and characterizing features of the RhPt-NaMn-Ce/Al2O3
   catalyst with FTIR of adsorbed NO and chemisorption of CO and CO2. An
   important factor is that the addition of Mn prevents the Na species from
   undesired sintering during heat treatments, resulting in a larger
   surface area of exposed Na species, namely NOx trapping sites. This
   catalyst can also function in a commercial vehicle engine under
   lean-burn conditions and should be a promising catalyst for practical
   use. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Interdiffusion coefficients within the beta-phase region of the
   nickel-cobalt-chromium-aluminum (Ni-Co-Cr-Al) quaternary system were
   estimated by square root diffusivity analysis. The obtained results
   indicated that the cross interdiffusion coefficients D-ij (i not equal
   j, i, j = Al, Cr, Co) other than D-AlCo, were less than the main
   interdiffusion coefficients Do (i = j), and that the values of D-Ali
   were greater than those of D-Cri and D-Coi. This finding suggests that
   the addition of chromium decreases the interdiffusion coefficients of
   aluminum and cobalt, but the addition of cobalt did not cause an obvious
   change in the interdiffusion coefficients of aluminum and chromium in
   the beta-phase region. The different effects associated with the
   additions of chromium and cobalt were qualitatively discussed in light
   of the relationship between the thermodynamic properties of the system
   and Wagner's interaction parameter. The results revealed that the
   different effects could be ascribed to the stronger thermodynamic
   interactions between aluminum and cobalt compared to that between
   aluminum and chromium. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB ATI Allvac 718Plus is a novel nickel-based superalloy, which was
   designed for heavy-duty applications in aerospace gas turbines. The
   precipitation kinetics of the intermetallic delta (Ni3Nb) and gamma'
   (Ni-3(Al,Ti)) phases in this alloy are of scientific as well as
   technological interest because of their significant influence on the
   mechanical properties. Important parameters like grain size are
   controlled by coarse (5 precipitates located at grain boundaries,
   whereas small gamma' precipitates are responsible for strengthening by
   precipitation hardening. In the present study, the microstructure is
   investigated by three-dimensional atom probe tomography and simulated by
   computer modeling using the thermo-kinetic software MatCalc. The results
   of numerical simulations and experimental data are compared and
   critically discussed. It is shown that the chemical compositions of the
   phases change during isothermal aging, and the precipitation kinetics of
   delta and gamma' phases interact with each other as shown in a time
   temperature precipitation (TTP) plot. The TTP plot shows C-shaped curves
   with characteristic discontinuities in the temperature range, where
   simultaneous and concurrent precipitation of the delta and gamma' phases
   occurs. This leads to a competition in the diffusion of Nb and Al, which
   are partly present in both phases. Thus, the present study gives
   important information on heat treatments for ATI Allvac 718Plus in order
   to achieve the desired microstructure and mechanical properties.

   lower and the activation energy was higher than the corresponding
   parameters of Pd-(6-10)Ru and Pd-5.5Ni binary alloy membranes. Atomic
   carbon formed in the reaction on all of the alloys from the B series
   other than the B3-2 alloy did not form carbon deposits as polymer films,
   pyrolytic carbon, or soot strongly bound to the surface of each other to
   result in a decrease in the rate of reaction. On the surface of the B3-2
   alloy, atomic carbon initiated the formation of a polymer film weakly
   bound to the surface, which decreased the rate of reaction. A reaction
   mechanism was proposed to adequately describe the experimental results.

   by electrochemically dealloying a multicomponent metallic glass. In
   comparison with conventional nanoporous gold prepared by dealloying

   catalytic activity for electrooxidation of methanol as a free-standing

   is found to dramatically improve the electrochemical stability of
   nanoporous gold.

AB The effects of aluminum substitution to the structural, electrochemical,
   and gas phase hydrogen storage properties of C14-rich alloys are
   reported. Minor phases, including C15 and TiNi, were identified by X-ray
   diffraction analysis. Entropy and enthalpy were estimated from
   equilibrium pressure at a fixed hydrogen concentration due to the large
   slope factor in pressure-concentration-temperature isotherms. The
   stability of hydrides from these materials, determined from the
   pressure-concentration isotherm equilibrium pressure and maximum storage
   capacities has a better correlation with the change in entropy than that
   in enthalpy. Alloys having smaller unit cell volume, relatively low
   hydride heat of formation, and relatively higher degree of disorder
   exhibit lower plateau pressure, higher storage capacity, and smaller
   hydrogen diffusion coefficient. Comparing to the Co substitution in the
   same base alloy, Al substitution makes better contribution to both bulk
   hydrogen transport and surface reaction. Substituting 0.4% Al and 1.5%
   Co to AB2 alloy is found to be the best combination in terms of general
   nickel metal hydride battery performance. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All

   the crystallization of the residual glassy matrix. Scanning electron
   microscopy analysis after microwave exposure reveals the formation of

   that the surface clusters are enriched in Cu and AI. The occurrence of

   reinforces the need for prior characterization in particular by in situ
   time-resolved techniques.

   electrode degradation rate in the mixture of 10% CO + 90% CO2 was
   significantly lower than that in 10% H-2 + 90% H2O. The major changes in
   the electrode characteristics upon long exposure in working conditions
   were accounted for by changes in the high-frequency partial polarization
   resistance. In the course of long testing, the electrode microstructure
   was not significantly changed. In the presence of hydrogen-containing

   were shown to make an insignificant contribution to the current

   strong degradation of Ni cermet electrode was caused by poisoning its
   reaction sites with strongly linked adsorption forms of water
   (hydroxyls) at the positive charge of electrode.

   multicomponent alloys to account for the combined effect of different
   solute elements in solid solution and dispersoids, with a special focus
   on hot deformation of a range of Al-Mg-Mn alloys It is demonstrated that

   polystyrene/ polyethylene (HIPS/PE) blends. The Effect of
   compatibilization using styrene-butadiene-styrene copolymer (SBS) and
   styrene-ethylene-butylene-styrene copolymer (SEBS) on their properties
   was also studied. The results of linear viscoelastic properties showed
   negative deviation of viscosity and elasticity from the mixing rules in
   low HIPS content blends, while positive deviation was observed for high
   HIPS content blends. The former was related to weak interface and the
   latter was attributed to the hydrodynamic interaction of PE and PB
   particles. A wide range of co-continuity was observed for HIPS/PE blends
   which decreased using compatibilization. It was found that SEBS had
   better efficiency of compatibilization than SBS due to lower molecular
   weight and the presence of ethylene block in SEBS structure. The
   fracture behavior of low and high HIPS content blends showed different
   mechanism because of higher volume contraction of PE than HIPS in

   and PE. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Appl Polym Sci 114:

AB Quasicrystals are a kind of special crystals, combining aperiodicity
   with long-range translational order and displaying a strong potential of
   applications. However, the forming law of quasicrystals, especially
   icosahedral, which have drawn a lot of attention since the discovery of
   the first quasicrystal, are not clearly known. A general knowledge,
   derived from the past work, is that the quasicrystal belongs to
   Hume-Rothery phase with special electron concentration per atom (e/a),
   and furthermore needs meeting the topological packing of atoms. Based on
   this, certain criteria named by e/a-constant line, e/a-variant line and
   cluster line, et al., have been used to design novel quasicrystals,
   especially in ternary alloy systems. But, as indicated in the previous
   work, these rules would not work very well in pseudo-ternary or
   quaternary systems built on Ti-Zr-Ni quasicrystals with the addition of
   Co or Cu. In order to further specify the quasicrystal formation in
   multi-component systems, in the present study an investigation was
   conducted in an alloy system, based on Ti45Zr38Ni17 and Ti40Zr40Ni20
   alloys with the addtion of Pd, because Pd is the neighbourship of Ni in
   the element table like Co and Cu and has the a,tom size and e/a between
   Ti (or Zr) and Ni. Using XRD, TEM and OM. it is found that in the
   suction cast alloys, the icosahedral quasicrystal (IQC) phase is formed
   in the coexistence of a little bcc beta-(Ti,Zr) in Ti45Zr38Ni17 alloy
   and of a bit hexagonal alpha-(Ti,Zr) in Ti40Zr40Ni20 alloy. And after
   2%Pd (atomic fraction) substitution for Ti and Zr, a MgZn2-type Laves
   C14 phase with coordination number of 14 is precipitated along with the
   disappearance of beta-(Ti,Zr) with coordination number of 8 in the
   former alloy, while only a complete IQC phase with coordination number
   of 12 is yielded in the latter alloy. However, as the subtitution is
   increased up to 6.7% or 13.3% in Ti40Zr40Ni20 alloy, the formation of
   IQC is prevented and the C14 phase occurs instead till a single C14
   phase forms in Ti40Zr26.7Ni20Pd13.3 alloy. The results show that the Pd
   addition in Ti-Zr-Ni alloys would promote closer atom packing, being
   beneficial to the formation of Laves phase because of the weak
   interaction between Fermi surface and Brillouin zone in Hume-Rothery
   phase like IQC.

AB The Fe-based multicomponent amorphous alloys (also referred to as
   metallic glasses) are known to exhibit soft magnetic properties and, it
   makes them important for many technological applications. However,
   metallic glasses are in a thermodynamically metastable state and in case
   of high temperature operating conditions, the thermally activated
   crystallization would be detrimental to their magnetic properties. The
   study of crystallization kinetics of metallic glasses gives useful
   insight about its thermal stability. In the present work,
   crystallization study of Fe(67)Co(18)B(14)Si(1) (2605CO) metallic glass
   has been carried out using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)
   technique. Mossbauer study has also been undertaken to know the phases
   formed during the crystallization process. The alloy shows two-stage
   crystallization. The activation energy has been derived using the
   Kissinger method. It is found to be equal to 220 kJ/mol and 349 kJ/mol
   for the first and second crystallization peaks, respectively. The
   Mossbauer study indicates the formation of alpha-(Fe, Co) and (Fe,
   Co)(3)B phases in the alloy.

AB Computerized thermodynamic databases for solid and liquid metals, slag,
   and solid oxide phases in the
   Al(2)O(3)-CaO-CoO-CrO-Cr(2)O(3)-FeO-Fe(2)O(3)-MgO-MnO-NiO-SiO(2) system
   (with dissolved S and P) have been developed by critical
   evaluation/optimization of various available phase equilibrium and
   thermodynamic data. The databases contain parameters of models
   specifically developed for molten slags, liquid steel, and solid oxide
   solutions such as spinel, pyroxenes, olivine, monoxide (wustite,
   periclase, lime), corundum, etc. By means of the optimization process,
   model parameters are found which reproduce various thermodynamic and
   phase equilibrium data within experimental error limits. Furthermore,
   the models permit extrapolation into regions of temperature and
   composition where data are not available. The databases are
   automatically accessed by user-friendly software that calculates complex
   equilibria involving slag, metals, refractories, and gases
   simultaneously, for systems with many components, over wide ranges of
   temperature, oxygen potential, and pressure. A short review of the
   available databases is presented. The critical evaluation/optimization
   procedure is outlined using the Al(2)O(3)-CaO-FeO-Fe(2)O(3)-MgO-SiO(2)
   and Al(2)O(3)-CaO-MnO-SiO(2) systems as examples. Several applications
   of the databases to deoxidation, dehydrogenation, and dephosphorization
   of iron and to inclusion control in steel are discussed.

AB Segregation of trace elements on a surface, at grain boundaries or more
   generally in any interface can have important consequences: adhesion of
   thin films, catalytic activity, embrittlement of steels by P or of
   nickel alloys by S, reinforcement of nickel alloys by B, etc.
   Segregation kinetics can be simulated by a finite element (FE) approach,
   by implementing the Darken-Du Plessis equation at the interface and
   Fick's diffusion laws in the bulk. It is then possible to simulate
   segregation kinetics in non-isothermal conditions, and to couple
   segregation and macroscopic heat transfer calculations. A previously
   developed model is here adapted to the case of complex interfacial
   segregation phenomena: (i) segregation of a single species with a
   solute-solute or solute-solvent interaction, (ii) co-segregation of two
   species with a site competition in the interface, and (iii) segregation
   of a single species at an interface between two phases. Results are
   compared with available experimental data.

   by X-ray diffraction (XRD), field-emission scanning electron microscopy

   electron microscopy (TEM). The results showed the presence of an FeMoSi
   phase and a BCC phase in the dendritic and interdendritic regions,
   respectively. The wear resistance of the cladding layer was four times
   that of the substrate. The improvement of wear resistance of the
   cladding layer could be attributed to the high hardness of the dendritic
   FeMoSi phase and nanoscale precipitation in the interdendritic region.
   The covalent-dominant strong atomic bonds in FeMoSi enhanced the
   hardness and wear resistance of the cladding layer. (C) 2009 Elsevier

AB A combinatorial screening method for corrosion research using an ion
   beam co-sputtering system and a microelectrochemical probe was proposed.
   Small chips of pure Cr and Mo were placed on a large Fe-II%Cr plate, and
   those were used as a complex target for co-sputtering. The composition
   gradients of the sputter-deposited films were found to be controllable
   by the arrangement and the number of pure Cr and Mo chips. The optimum
   condition for fabricating Fe-Cr-Mo combinatorial libraries was
   investigated, and Fe-19%Cr-x%Mo (5 < x < 48) and Fe-7%Cr-x%Mo (3 < x <
   46) films were prepared. A microelectrochemical technique was applied to
   measure the corrosion behavior of the restricted small area on the
   combinatorial libraries. The small diameter of microelectrochemical
   probes was appropriate for suppressing the measurement error arising
   from the compositional gradient within an measured area. The influence
   of Mo content on the polarization behavior of Fe-Cr-Mo alloys in 1
   kmol.m(-3) H2SO4 and 1 kmol.m(-3) NaCl were investigated. The results
   obtained were similar to those previously reported for bulk Fe-Cr-Ni
   alloys, which indicated that the combinatorial screening method proposed
   in this study would be used for high-throughput tests for corrosion
   research. [doi:10.2320/matertrans.M2009130]

AB We have evaluated the predictive ability of a simple method combing the

   chemical mixing enthalpy and the normalized configurational entropy
   S-config/R in rapidly locating the bulk metallic glass (BMG)-forming
   composition region, in four multicomponent alloy systems. It is shown
   that the BMG-forming regions are similar in the topologically and
   chemically equivalent La-Al-Co and Ce-Al-Co alloy systems. However, in
   the topologically equivalent Zr-Ti-Cu-Ni and Zr-Ti-Al-Cu-Ni alloy
   systems, the BMG-forming regions are quite different due to the
   difference in chemical bonding between constituents. BMG formation is
   most probably a compromise between topological and chemical effects.
   This method could be a new approach to rapidly locate BMG-forming
   composition region in multicomponent alloy systems, in which eutectic
   compositions are difficult to be measured in experiments.

AB We present a new formulation of a composite phase-field and
   Lattice-Boltzmann model to analyze the effect of fluid flow on the
   fort-nation of solidification microstructures. The phase-field model is
   based on a description suitable to treat phase tansformation processes
   and moving boundary problems in multiphase and multicomponent systems as
   well as in polycrystalline structures. The flow of the liquid is
   simulated by a Lattice-Boltzmann-BGK (LBGK) method. Interactions of the
   flow field with thermal and solutal convection are incorporated by
   additional advection terms in the mass and heat diffusion equations. At
   the boundaries between solid and liquid phases, the flow is modelled by
   a diffuse bounce back approach.
   In two- and three-dimensional numerical simulations, we apply the model
   to investigate flow driven changes of the dendritic morphology in the
   Ni-Cu system. In particular, we impose different flow velocities at the
   boundary of the computational domain and investigate the different
   growth rates of the dendritic tip towards the direction of flow and on
   the shielded side. Furthermore, the influence of a fluid field on
   lamellar and rod-like eutectic growth structures is studied for Al-Cu
   alloys. Since new solute is supplied by the fluid, a more pronounced
   growth is observed in the direction of the flow for both cases,
   dendrites and eutectics. (C) 2009 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA,

   Sn, Co, and All as a group, were also compared to Mn using AB2 MH alloys
   in a nickel metal hydride (NiMH) battery. In all cases, higher Mn
   content degraded the cycle life performance while marginally increasing
   the discharge capacity. Without the presence of other modifiers, such as
   Sn, Co, and Al, Mn proved to be detrimental to both charge retention and
   activation of Ti-based C14 Laves phase MH alloys. However, in
   combination with Sn, Co, and Al; Mn contributed positively to charge
   retention while activation remained at a manageable level. It has also
   been shown a lower Mn and higher Ni content improved the specific power
   and low temperature performance, whereas increasing Cr content at the
   expense of Mn improved cycle life and charge retention in a NiMH

   FeNiCrCuCo and FeNiCrCuMo alloys consist of a single FCC solid solution.
   When Cu or Co in the alloys is substituted by Al, the microstructures of
   the alloys change to that of BCC solid solution or that of a BCC+ FCC
   solid solution. The results show that Cu with a FCC structure promotes
   the formation of a FCC solid solution. Although Al has a FCC structure,
   it does not help the formation of a FCC solid solution. In addition,
   when Zr is added into the alloys, complicated compounds are present due
   to the stronger compound formation tendency between Zr and other
   components. It is found that the hardness of alloys with a BCC structure
   is higher than that of the alloys with a FCC structure. The hardness of
   the alloys increases with increasing of Al content. When complicated
   compounds are formed, the hardness increases further. The highest
   hardness reaches 566 HV due to the strengthening of the second phase

   in the pseudopotential approximation and the statistical thermodynamical
   theory of liquid alloys The. magnitude of atomic ordering energies,
   calculated by means of the electronic theory of alloys in the
   pseudopotential approximation, was subsequently used for calculation of
   the key thermodynamic parameters such as enthalpy, entropy and Gibbs
   free energy of mixing, viscosity, and critical cooling rate of the
   binary Ti-Cu and ternary Ti-Cu-X alloys. The potential alloying elements
   (X) can be divided in two groups defined by their effect on the

   groups have already been used successfully for the fabrication of new

AB The binary Ni-Bi alloys as well as multicomponent materials comprising
   systems like Ni-Bi-Sn, Ni-Bi-Sb etc. are recently considered as
   prospective for design of lead-free solders. For that reason various
   authors focused their attention to the Ni-Bi system thermodynamics. The
   studies identified five phases in the above system. Two of them (i.e.,
   (Ni) and liquid), were treated as disordered substitutional solutions.
   The phase NiBi(3) is stoichiometric and a standard two-sublattice model
   was repeatedly applied to describe its Gibbs free energy, while for the
   nonstoichiometric NiBi phase, a three-sublattice model was retained. The
   pure bismuth phase ((Bi)) is stoichiometric as well. The results are
   discussed and compared to literature thermochemical and topological
   data. In liquid state, strong repulsions between nickel and bismuth
   atoms are anticipated in the nickel rich-side, but no data about a
   liquid phase miscibility gap is available yet. Therefore, the stability
   of the liquid phase has to be reassured, in spite of positive deviations
   from ideal behaviour. (c) 2009 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA,

   new multicomponent alloys with compensated magnetic anisotropy is
   calculated in the framework of the single-ion magnetic anisotropy model
   with allowance for the data on the temperature dependences of the
   magnetic anisotropy constants for R Fe 2 single crystals. The
   synthesized compounds are characterized using metallographic, chemical,
   X-ray diffraction, and thermomagnetic methods. A combined analysis of
   the magnetic and magnetoelastic properties is also carried out. It is
   established that the high magnetostriction characteristics of the

   structure of Laves phases are observed in the region of the
   spin-reorientational phase transition whose temperature can be varied by
   properly choosing the Co content. It is found that, in the
   room-temperature region, the magnetic susceptibility (d lambda/dH) of
   the composition with x = 1.3 reaches levels in excess of the value of d
   lambda/dH for terphenol D due to the compensation of magnetic
   anisotropy.

AB A coupled thermodynamic-kinetic oxidation model is presented for the
   selective, external oxidation of the most reactive alloy constituent of
   a multicomponent multiphase alloy. The model computes the composition
   depth profiles of the alloy constituents in the alloy as well as the
   evolution in the phase fractions in the alloy as function of oxidation
   time. The applicability of the model is illustrated through several
   examples. For the isothermal and cyclic oxidation of single- and
   two-phase binary alloys excellent agreement was obtained between the
   numerical calculations and the corresponding analytical solutions. For
   the isothermal oxidation of two gamma+beta NiCrAl alloys with different
   initial volume fractions of the 0 phase, very good agreement was
   obtained between experimentally and calculated composition depth
   profiles. Finally, the effect of alloying additions on the phase
   evolution in the alloy was studied for the isothermal oxidation of
   freestanding MCrAlY (M = Ni, Co) coatings. It is shown that for a
   similar bulk Al and Cr content in the coating, the concentration
   profiles of Al in the coating after oxidation can be significantly
   affected by alloying with elements like Co, Ta and Re. Consequently, the
   multicomponent and multiphase character of the MCrAlY coating has to be
   taken into account when performing lifetime studies. (C) 2008 Acta

   greatly boosted their performance and also revealed interesting features
   as oscillating magnetoresistance with a number of atomic layers in a

   tight-binding dynamics is used to describe quantum conduction in a
   multicomponent system with spin-polarized electrodes separated by an
   ultrathin and atomically coherent nonmagnetic spacer (either metallic or
   insulating). A possibility is indicated for obtaining a huge resonant
   enhancement of magnetoresistance in such device by a special choice of
   gate voltage on the spacer element.

AB The generalized Boltzmann-Matano method has been used to evaluate the
   interdiffusion coefficients at 1100 degrees C for the fcc phase of the

   coefficients, together with other experimental data in the literature,
   have been assessed to develop an atomic mobility database for the fcc
   phase of the Co-Fe-Ni ternary. The atomic mobility database, in
   conjunction with the CALPHAD-base thermodynamics, has been used to
   simulate a number of ternary diffusion couple experiments. Comprehensive
   comparisons between the calculated and experimental data show that
   excellent agreement is obtained not only for the general diffusion data
   of ternary diffusion couple, such as the interdiffusion coefficients and
   the concentration profiles, but also for much of in-depth diffusion
   behavior, like the diffusion path, the interdiffusion flux and the shift

AB In general galvanizing Si dissolved from steels destabilizes the Gamma
   and Gamma(1) phases in the alloy layer of the coating. It also alters
   the morphology of zeta crystallites in the alloy layer thereby exposing
   the delta layer to the melt. The incompatibility of the liquid phase and
   the delta phase cause the latter to disintegrate. These changes result
   in an excessive steel reactivity in general galvanizing. This reactivity
   can be easily controlled by alloying the Zn bath with metals, such as
   Ni, if the Si content of the steel does not exceed 0.20%. To combat a
   fully developed reactivity problem, one has to stabilize the Gamma and
   delta sublayers in the coating. Alloying the bath with suitable metals
   can generate new equilibrium states to allow the co-existence of the
   liquid phase and the delta phase thereby preventing its disintegration;
   the Gamma and Gamma(1) phases can be stabilized through solid solution
   of the alloying elements in these phases. The introduction of Al to
   general galvanizing baths generates new equilibrium states thereby
   ushering a total new approach to Si reactivity control.

AB Hydrogen permeance decrease, owing to the covalent interaction of carbon
   monoxide with the Pd-Ag membrane surface, represents a considerable
   drawback, since this decreases the efficiency of the alloy membranes.
   This work proposes a novel Sieverts-Langmuir's model taking into account
   the mentioned adsorption. The proposed model equation, in order to take
   into account the fraction of the membrane surface not active for
   hydrogen permeation, introduces Langmuir's isotherm, which is the
   surface loading in the classical Sieverts' permeation equation. The
   evaluation of the alpha parameter and the Langmuir affinity constant
   involved in the proposed model was carried out using experimental data
   measured using a 60 mu m thick Pd-Ag commercial membrane at 647 K (374
   degrees C), up to a total pressure of 700 kPa. The presented model
   yields, in a parametric form, a quantitative assessment of hydrogen
   permeance decrease caused by the adsorption of gases on Pd-Ag membrane
   surfaces. Therefore, this novel Sieverts-Langmuir's equation models
   hydrogen permeation through Pd-Ag-based membranes in the presence of
   inhibitor gases such as CO. In addition, by ab initio evaluation of the
   alpha and the Langmuir affinity constant, the proposed
   Sieverts-Langmuir's equation can identify a new membrane with better
   efficiency. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB According to the vacancy formation energy (Delta H-h) in binary alloys,
   an easy approach for the computation of multi-component alloys is
   suggested. And the calculated Delta H-h values have linear correlation
   with the crystallization temperature (T-x) in Ca-Mg-Cu, Mg-Cu-Gd,
   Zr-Ni-Al and Cu-Zr-Ti alloying systems. Based on the relationship
   between Gibbs free energy (Delta G) and the liquidus temperature (T-I)
   and the glass-forming ability (GFA) indicator alpha (=T-x/T-I), a new
   expression containing Delta H-h, mixing entropy (Delta H-mix) and
   configurational enthalpy (S-config) for estimation of GFA is defined as
   Delta H-h Delta(HSconfig)-S-mix. The predicted composition lines derived

   Zr-Cu-Be, Ca-Mg-Zn and Cu-Zr-Ti alloying systems, respectively.
   Moreover, values of Delta H-h Delta(HSconfig)-S-mix is found to have a
   strong correlation with the critical diameters in La-Ce-Al-Co
   quarternary alloying system. Finally, three BMGs with Cu-rich
   compositions in Cu-Zr-Al alloying system are prepared and the
   experimental result about GFA is consistent with the computational Delta
   H-h Delta(HSconfig)-S-mix values. (C) 2007 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Microsegregation in the Al 4 wt pct Cu alloy was investigated
   experimentally in a large range of cooling rates from 0.01 to 20,000 K/s
   using different solidification techniques. The microstructure was
   modeled using two-dimensional (2-D) pseudo-front tracking (PFT)
   developed by Jacot and co-workers. The experimentally determined amount
   of nonequilibrium eutectics increases with the cooling rate in the range
   0.01 to 3 K/s and then decreases in the range 20 to 20,000 K/s. The
   fraction of eutectic calculated from the 2-D PFT model shows not only
   the same tendency, but also agrees quantitatively very well with the
   experiments over the range of cooling rates. It can also be explained
   qualitatively how the observed in terms of coarsening of the secondary
   dendrite arms and the back diffusion in the way both depend on the local
   solidification time.

   CoNiCu and 65.09 Oe for CoNi, respectively. After annealed at 923 K for
   0.5 h, the H-c of CuNi, CoCu, CoNiCu and CoNi increased significantly to

AB A method to design new, not yet synthesized, multicomponent alloys based
   on knowledge of binary alloys is applied to develop Pd-alloys for
   membranes for gas separation. The approach couples the cluster variation
   method with effective pair potentials to describe the phase boundaries
   between the alpha-solid solution (low hydrogen content) and beta-hydride
   phases. The calculations illustrate (i) that the method can predict
   alpha-beta phase boundaries of hydrogen in binary and ternary Pd-alloys,
   (ii) how the relative interaction strengths of filled and empty
   interstitial sites influence the width of the miscibility gap, (iii)
   that the hydrogen absorption capacity of an alloy is related to the
   hydride phase stability and (iv) the presence of short range order of
   hydrogen in beta-hydrides.

AB Recently, core-shell Ag-Co, Ag-Cu, and "onionlike" Cu-Co equilibrium
   configurations were predicted in the case of isolated face centered
   cubic (fcc) bimetallic clusters, and three shell onionlike
   configurations were predicted in the case of ternary metallic clusters
   with spherical and truncated octahedral morphologies. In the present
   paper, immiscible binary CuCo and ternary AgCuCo clusters with
   icosahedral structures are studied as functions of their size and
   composition. Clusters studied are formed by 13, 55, 147, 309, and 561
   atoms corresponding to the five smallest possible closed shell
   icosahedral structures. An embedded atom model potential is used to
   describe their cohesion. Equilibrium configurations are investigated by
   means of Metropolis Monte Carlo free energy minimization in the (NPT)
   canonical ensemble. Most simulations are achieved at 10 and 300 K. The
   effect of temperature on segregation ordering is systematically
   investigated. Selected cases are used to identify the effect of size and
   composition on melting. In contrast with fcc clusters, homogeneous
   onionlike configurations of binary clusters are not predicted. When it
   is allowed by the composition, a complete outer shell is formed by Cu in
   binary Cu-Co clusters and by Ag in ternary Ag-Cu-Co clusters. Depending
   on temperature, Co may precipitate into decahedral groups under the Cu
   vertices of the icosahedra in binary clusters, while the Co-Cu
   configuration in ternary clusters drastically depends on the Ag coating.
   Despite the multicomponent character of the clusters and the
   immiscibility of the species forming them, for most compositions and
   sizes, equilibrium structures remain close to perfectly icosahedral at
   10 K as well as at 300 K.

AB In the present work multicomponent Co-based alloys with nominal
   composition Co72-xFexZr8B20 (x = 10, 15, and 20 at.%) were synthesized
   by single-roller melt-spinning. The measurement of coercivity, H-c
   reveals the soft magnetic behavior of investigated alloys. The value of
   H-c increases from 23 A/m for alloy with x = 10 at.% up to 32 A/m for
   alloy with x = 20 at.%. Further it was found that crystallization
   temperature of as-quenched alloys slightly varies with iron content and
   lays between 605 and 625 degrees C. From the temperature dependence of
   magnetization it follows that partial substitution of cobalt by iron has
   positive influence on the Curie temperature of amorphous phase, T,m,
   which increases from 300 degrees C up to 462 degrees C for alloy with x
   = 10 at.% and x = 20 at.%, respectively.

   (SiO2)(1 - x) nanocomposites are studied by x-ray absorption near-edge
   spectroscopy, which is extremely sensitive to the chemical environment
   of elements in multicomponent compounds. An analysis of the recorded Fe
   L-2,L- 3, Co L-2,L- 3, B K, Si L-2,L- 3, and O K absorption spectra
   demonstrates interatomic interactions between the elements of the
   metallic and dielectric components of the nanocomposites. As a result of
   these interatomic interactions, a complex multiphase system, whose
   electronic structure should determine the transport and magnetic
   properties of the nanocomposites, forms. In particular, the
   transformation of the fine structure of the iron L-2,L- 3 spectra
   reflects a change in the ratio of divalent to trivalent iron in its
   oxides and/or silicates. CoO and complex boron oxides are found to exist
   in the nanocomposites. The electrical conductivity of a FeO center dot
   F2O3 center dot CoO grain embedded in the silicate-oxide medium of the
   nanocomposites is controlled by electron exchange between Co2+, Fe2+,
   and Fe3+ ions. The dielectric component consists of a mixture of silicon
   oxide and the silicates/borosilicates of transition metals.

   with maltose, C12H22O11, as a reductant and structure former. The
   process parameters have been optimized in terms of the dispersion medium
   composition and the way in which Pt is introduced. The coatings are
   highly uniform in chemical and phase composition, as evidenced by
   quantitative analysis, optical microscopy, and x-ray microanalysis
   results. Characteristically, the coatings have a highly porous structure
   and good adhesive properties. Catalysts prepared by the proposed process
   show high activity for the oxygen oxidation of CO. The process can be
   used to fabricate Pt-Pd-Rh catalysts on block supports for the
   purification of vehicle exhaust gases and industrial off-gases. It has
   the advantage that high-porosity multicomponent catalytic coatings can
   be produced on cordierite block supports in a single step.

   crystallization, X-ray diffractometry and transmission electron

   characteristics have been investigated. The transformation temperature

   nanostructured lithium metal storage anodes. Following this trend, we
   have synthesized by high energy ball milling an Sn-Co-C ternary compound
   of composition supposedly similar to that used in the new commercial
   battery. We have tested this material as an electrode in a single
   lithium cells, as well as in an original, complete lithium-ion battery

AB The use of multi-component femoral implants to replace the femur head
   and re-establish bone motion has been widespread since the 70s.
   Frequently these implants have spherical metallic heads made of, for
   example, 316-L stainless steel or Cr-Co alloys, which allow rotational
   motion towards a polymeric component (UHMWPE). One of the major causes
   of implant rejection is the generation of UHMWPE debris on the surface
   between the implant head and the polymeric component. The gamma ray
   sterilization of implants and the periodical X-ray medical control could
   contribute to premature degradation of the polymeric surface, resulting
   in increased wear and shortened lifetime of the implant. In this work we
   study the degradation degree of the polymeric UHMWPE component as
   function of the X-ray dose. The elasto-plastic deformation and recovery
   were carried out by means of a nanohardness tester equipment and the
   polymer degradation was measured using a fast Fourier transform
   infra-red (FT-IR) equipment. The results show the compromise among the
   irradiation doses, the surface oxidation and the mechanical properties
   of the samples.

AB Ti-Cu-Ni-Co quaternary amorphous alloys produce by melt spinning were
   found to have a wide supercooled liquid region before crystallization,
   though no glass transition was observed in Ti-Cu binary amorphous
   alloys. The largest temperature interval of the supercooled liquid
   region (Delta T-x) isas largeas 90 K for Ti50Cu25Ni20Co5.Thcre is a
   tendency for Delta T-x to increase with an increase in storage modulus
   and with a decrease in loss modulus. It is therefore presumed that the
   increase in Delta T-x for the multicomponent amorphous alloy is due to
   the suppression of crystallization for the supercooled liquid resulting
   from the increase in viscosity. (C) 1994 Elsevier Science B.V. All

AB The formation of bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) has been analyzed with a
   tetrahedron composition diagram, which is comprised of constituent
   classes from blocks of elements in the periodic table. When Al and Ga
   are involved in the BMG composition environment. they are assumed to
   correspond to either s- or p-block elements. The analysis under the
   assumption reveals the presence of a composition band that connects the
   composition regions over different classes of BMGs. The diagram has a
   topological simplicity, is applicable to any multicomponent alloy
   system, and can be analyzed from the bonding nature of the atomic pairs.
   Thus, this diagram is an important tool for analyzing and developing
   BMGs.

AB Binary Nb-N coatings, ternary Ti-Nb-N and Zr-Nb-N, and multi-layer
   TiN/NbN coatings consisting of up to 100 alternating TiN and NbN layers,
   were deposited onto WC-Co substrates, using two different vacuum are
   deposition (VAD) systems: with and without magnetic guiding of the metal
   plasma flow. Binary Nb-N coatings were fabricated by deposition of metal
   plasma produced by a Nb cathode in a background of reactive nitrogen gas
   at different pressures, P. Ternary coatings were fabricated at
   co-deposition of plasmas originating from two different cathode
   materials. Multilayer coatings were fabricated by alternatively
   depositing plasmas of Ti and Nb in reactive nitrogen gas. The
   crystalline coating structure, phase composition, hardness and critical
   load for coating failure were studied.
   For binary Nb-N coatings fabricated using both deposition systems, the
   phase composition, the Vickers hardness, HV, and the critical load
   strongly depended on the deposition pressure. Using VAD with magnetic
   plasma guiding, the highest HV of similar to 42 GPa was measured for
   coatings deposited at low nitrogen pressure. These coatings contained a
   hexagonal beta-Nb2N phase and had a relatively low critical load. The
   highest critical load and HV similar to 38 GPa were obtained for
   coatings consisted of a single phase NaCl-type cubic delta-NbN
   structure, deposited at a. higher nitrogen pressure. The structure and
   properties of Nb-N coatings deposited using VAD without magnetic plasma
   guiding had a similar correlation with the deposition pressure, however,
   their hardness values were lower.
   Ternary Ti-Nb-N and Zr-Nb-N coatings fabricated by both deposition
   processes had a single phase cubic NaCl-type structure and the hardness
   higher than that of the binary nitrides TiN, ZrN and NbN. The hardest
   coatings, HV similar to 51.5 Pa, deposited with magnetic plasma guiding
   had a single-phase cubic delta-(Ti,Nb)N structure and a Ti:Nb ratio of
   similar to 50:50 (at.%).
   Multilayer coatings TiN/NbN consisting of 20-40 alternating TiN and NbN
   layers with total thickness of 4-5 mu m increased the life time of
   cemented carbide cutting inserts at tuming tough Ni-base alloys by 2-7
   times relative to uncoated cutting tools, while conventional vacuum arc
   deposited TiN coatings were not effective in machining of these alloys.

   supercells with 1 solute atom and 107 solvent atoms. It is found that
   the atomic size difference, the electronic interactions, and the
   magnetic spin relations between the solute and solvent atoms all
   contribute to the lattice distortions. Based on the results from
   first-principles calculations, the linear composition coefficients of
   fcc Ni lattice parameter for different solutes were determined, and the
   lattice parameters of multicomponent Ni-base superalloys as a function
   of solute composition were predicted. The results are compared with

AB A contingency table analysis procedure is developed and applied to three
   dimensional atom probe data sets for the investigation of fine-scale
   solute co-/anti-segregation effects in multicomponent alloys. Potential
   sources of error and inaccuracy are identified and eliminated from the
   technique. The conventional P value testing techniques associated with
   chi(2) are shown to be unsatisfactory and can become ambiguous in cases
   of large block numbers or high solute concentrations. The coefficient of
   contingency is demonstrated to be an acceptable and useful basis of
   comparison for contingency table analyses of differently-conditioned
   materials. However, care must be taken in choice of block size and to
   maintain a consistent overall composition between experiments. The
   coefficient is dependent upon block size and solute composition, and
   cannot be used to compare analyses with significantly different solute
   compositions or to assess the extent of clustering without reference to
   that of the randomly ordered case. It is shown that as clustering
   evolves into larger precipitates and phases, contingency table analysis
   becomes inappropriate. Random labeling techniques are introduced to
   infer further meaning from the coefficient of contingency. We propose
   the comparison of experimental result, mu(exp), to the randomized value,
   mu(rand), as a new method by which to interpret the quantity of solute
   clustering present in a material. It is demonstrated that how this
   method may be utilized to identify an appropriate size of contingency
   table analysis blocks into which the data set is partitioned to optimize
   the significance of the results.

AB {Sc,Ti}(2)M3Si alloys (M = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni) were investigated by
   X-ray powder and single crystal diffraction, optical microscopy and
   electronic density-functional theory. Structure determination from X-ray
   CCD-data from a single crystal of Ti2Co3Si and Rietveld refinements of
   X-ray powder diffraction data for Sc2M3Si (M = Fe, Co) and Ti2M3Si (M =
   Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni) revealed in all cases isotypism with the C14
   MgZn2-type Laves phase: Sc (or Ti) atoms fully occupy the 4f sites,
   whereas M and Si atoms share the 6h and 2a sites in various ratios, in
   good agreement with ab inito results. Furthermore, the series of
   enthalpies of formation for these compounds as well as for the two
   binary intermetallics, ScFe2 and Sc5Si3, have been calculated to compare
   with available calorimetric data for multicomponent-alloys design. The
   enthalpy of formation of Ti2Fe3Si of -55.9 +/- 1.6 kJ/mol of atoms
   measured in an isoperibolic calorimeter agrees well with the calculated
   value of -52.6 kJ/mol of atoms. The chemical instability of "Sc2Cr3Si"
   with the MgZn2-type structure was theoretically confinned by the
   calculation considering the competing phases in equilibrium. The general
   trends of thermodynamic stabilities versus atomic number of M were
   discussed for {Sc,Ti}(2)M3Si. Our Structural models confirm the fact
   that M/Si substitution of 16.7 at.% Si in the binary Laves phase
   stabilizes for all these ternary compounds a MgZn2-type structure
   irrespective of the crystal structure of the binary parent Laves phase.
   Finally, spin-polarized calculations for four selected compounds (ScFe2,
   Sc2Fe3Si, TiFe2, Ti2Fe3Si) indicate a significant drop of the local
   magnetic moment of Fe upon substitution of Fe by Si. (c) 2006 Elsevier

   of Ar+ 14% N(2). The films were characterized in terms of their
   structure, chemical, mechanical, and tribological properties. The
   biocompatibility of the films was evaluated by both in vitro and in vivo
   experiments. In vitro studies involved the investigation of adhesion,
   spreading and proliferation of Rat-1 fibroblasts, MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts,
   and IAR-2 epithelial cells, morphometric analysis, actin cytoskeleton
   and focal contacts staining of the cells cultivated on the films.
   Alkaline phosphatase activity and von Kossa staining of osteoblastic
   culture were investigated. Three groups of the in vivo investigations
   were fulfilled. Teflon plates coated with the tested films were inserted
   subcutaneous in mice and analysis of the population of cells on the
   surfaces was performed. Implantation studies of Ti rings and Ti rods
   coated with tested films using rat calvarian and hip defect models were
   also fulfilled. The results obtained show that Ti-based multicomponent
   films possess a combination of high hardness and adhesion strength,
   reduced Young's modulus, low wear and friction, high corrosion
   resistance with bioactivity, biocompatibility and non-toxicity that
   makes the films promising candidates as tribological coatings to be used

   spectrometry were used to investigate the intermixed interface produced
   during laser cladding of a Co-Cr-Mo alloy on a steel substrate. A
   multi-component system and rapid solidification conditions together lead
   to a complex microstructure at the interface. The solidification of the
   cladding starts with the formation of an interface layer, which is about
   75 mu m in thickness and consists of randomly oriented equiaxed grains
   of Co-Cr-Fe solid solution and martensite. Orientation analysis of the
   grains in the interface layer revealed that some grains have a special
   orientation relationship with the former austenite grains in the heat
   affected zone but the cladding is not formed by epitaxial growth on the
   substrate. Intermixing of the materials at the interface is providing a
   strong bond between the substrate and the cladding. For a grain from the
   interface layer to emerge as columnar grain in the cladding, it was
   determined that its < 001 > crystallographic direction is not supposed
   to deviate more than 25 degrees from the sample normal direction.

   investigated in aerated 0.1 and 0.5 kmol/m(3) sulphurie acid solutions.
   All tests were carried out with the same materials in different states:
   as-cast and relaxed glassy and crystalline states. It was found that the
   multicomponent [(Fe0.6Co0.4)(0.75)B0.2Si0.05](96)Nb-4 glassy alloy had
   an ability to passivation in aerated sulphuric acid solutions
   irrespective of microstructure. The subsequent complete crystallization
   of the bulk glassy alloy leads to a significant decrease in corrosion
   resistance, while appropriate structural relaxation results in an
   increase in corrosion resistance. The corrosion results were discussed
   and correlated with the evolution of crystallization processes by means
   of XRD and DSC. The effect of temperature of the corrosive medium on the
   corrosion behavior of the as-cast [(Fe0.6Co0.4)(0.75)B0.2Si0.05](96)Nb-4
   glassy alloy has also been analyzed.

AB When combining a stoichiometric Laves phase C15-A(2)B(1) with a solid
   solution C15 phase(s) into a multicomponent system, a sublattice
   remodeling of the (A, B)2 (A, B) 1 compound is needed for the sake of
   database compatibility. This then requires a set of physically-grounded
   thermodynamic parameters for the hypothetical C15 variants (in the
   simplest case, A(2)A, B2B, and B(2)A), in order to avoid distortion of
   the phase field relating to the C15 phase in the A-B phase diagram due
   to the sublattice remodeling. For this purpose, the present
   investigation employed first-principles (FP) calculations to study the
   lattice stability of the stable binary C15-M2R (M = Al, Co, Ni; R = Ca,
   Ce, Nd, Y) and their hypothetical (unstable) C15 variants at T = 0 K.
   Our results demonstrated that use of the empirical parameters and energy
   constraint commonly used in the literature leads to a too large
   homogeneity range in some of the systems studied and, consequently,
   significant distortions of the phase diagram. In contrast, when
   enthalpies of formation based on FP calculations were used for the
   hypothetical C15 phases, such distortion of the phase diagram is
   minimized. The other advantage is that there is no need for
   re-optimization of the existing thermodynamic databases. Therefore, it
   is proposed that FP enthalpies of formation should be used for the
   thermodynamic descriptions of hypothetical C15 phases, at least when the
   empirical parameters fail to reproduce a reasonably accurate A-B binary
   phase diagram. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A new ferromagnetic Co-Fe-Hf-Ti-Mo-B bulk metallic glass was produced by
   copper mould casting method, using industrial raw materials. The
   magnetic properties were studied with the high-performance hysteresis
   loop tracer. The low coercivity, as low as 2 A/m for the as-cast sample,
   was found in the Co-Fe-based metallic glass rod with a diameter of 1.5
   mm, the saturation magnetization is 0.6 T. The thermal stability was
   characterized by differential thermal analysis, X-ray diffraction was
   used to confirm the amorphous state of as-cast alloy and to perform the
   structural analysis of crystallization products. Crystallization
   temperature exceeding 900 K and supercooled liquid region of 35 K were
   found in the investigated glass. The high glass forming ability was
   explained by the slow nucleation rate of intermetallic compounds which
   are structurally complex in multicomponent system during solidification.
   High crystallization temperature suggests that the studied bulk metallic
   glass could be used as high-temperature soft magnetic material. (c) 2006

AB The laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy technique is employed for
   compositional analyses of thin films produced by pulsed laser ablation
   of multielemental targets.
   Information about the atomic concentration of the chemical species from
   the irradiated target is inferred by means of the optical emission
   spectra of the plasma generated during laser ablation. The atomic
   concentration percentages and the atomic concentration ratios of the
   elements of Co-based magnetic alloy targets are deduced from the
   integrated intensities of selected emission lines of the alloy
   components.
   The experimental results show that Co atomic percentage concentration
   and C-Si/C-Co and C-Cr/C-Co. atomic concentration ratios are in
   agreement with the corresponding values obtained by traditional
   compositional analysis techniques. On the contrary, Si atomic percentage
   concentration values are in disagreement, since the used emission lines
   have significant self-absorption values.
   Therefore, the work proves that laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy is
   adequate for elemental concentration measurements provided an accurate
   choice of the emission lines. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   cemented carbide (WC-Co) and magnesia (MgO) suspensions. The relatively
   novel types of comb-type anionic polymers with grafted non-ionic side
   chains are effective dispersants also in multi-component powder mixtures
   with a complex solution and surface chemistry and result in more robust
   suspensions at significantly higher solids loading compared with e.g., a
   traditional cationic polyelectrolyte. Direct force measurements on
   comb-type dispersants with different lengths of the grafted ethylene
   oxide side chains showed that the dispersants adsorb onto a MgO surface
   and infer a repulsion where the range scales with the length of the poly
   ethylene oxide side chains. The compressibility and the consolidation
   behavior of MgO particle networks in response to a centrifugal force
   field could be related to the estimated thickness of the adsorbed
   comb-type dispersants.

AB Soft magnetic thin films with suitable uniaxial anisotropy and high
   saturation magnetization are required for high frequency applications,
   since the ferromagnetic resonance frequency (f(FMR)) is proportional to
   the multiplication of the saturation magnetization and anisotropy
   magnetic field. In this study, multi-components of Fe-Co-Ni-based soft
   magnetic thin films were deposited on the Si substrate by radio
   frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering with various Ar/N-2 ratios at room
   temperature. The composition, crystal structure, surface morphology, and
   magnetic domain were analyzed. Without nitrogen doping, the domain of
   the magnetic thin film was arranged randomly. The effect of N-2 content
   in the thin film on the magnetic properties was evaluated and further
   discussed. Magnetic properties, including saturation magnetization (M-s)
   and coercivity (H-c), were determined. The saturation magnetization of
   the undoped magnetic thin film was around 1.3 T. However, when the
   nitrogen was added, the magnitude of the anisotropy field could reach 30
   Oe, while the saturation magnetization was around 1 T. It is expected
   that the derived magnetic thin film is a promising candidate for
   potential usage in high frequency inductors.

AB In this study, a remarkable promotion of ethanol electrooxidation by a
   Pt-Ru-W alloy is reported for an improvement of the anodic reaction of a
   direct ethanol fuel cell (DEFC). Pt-based binary and ternary
   electrocatalysts including Pt-Ru-W deposited onto a An substrate were
   prepared by co-sputtering process. By using this process, several metals
   can be arranged simultaneously and uniformly. The catalysts deposited
   onto An were evaluated for anodic electrode in I mol dm(-3) ethanol +
   0.5 mol dm-3 sulfuric acid by electrochemical measurements. The
   performance of Pt-Ru-W was desirable in comparison to that of binary
   alloys, such as Pt-W, Pt-Sn and Pt-Ru, which exhibit higher catalytic
   activity than single Pt metal layer electrode. Ethanol electrooxidation
   on Pt-Ru-W alloy showed a cathodic shift in the onset potential and a
   higher current density than the binary alloy electrodes. It was found
   that Pt-Ru-W ternary catalyst effects to not only methanol oxidation
   reaction but also ethanol oxidation reaction and that the current
   density of ethanol oxidation with Pt-Ru-W is about 2/3 to that of
   methanol at 0.5 V versus Ag/AgCl. The onset potentials for the ethanol
   oxidation reaction matched well the anodic peak potentials of the
   background volutammograms, i.e., 0.15 V versus Ag/AgCl for Pt-Ru-W and
   0.35 V versus Ag/AgCl for Pt-W and Pt-Ru electrodes. That is, it was
   postulated that the background peak current indicates the generation of
   oxide species like metal-OH necessary to complete the ethanol oxidation
   to CO2. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) have been classified according to the
   atomic size difference. heat of mixing (Delta H-mix) and period of the
   constituent elements in the periodic table. The BMGs discovered to date
   are classified into seven groups on the basis of a previous result by
   Inoue. The seven groups are as follows: (G-I) ETM/Ln-LTM/BM-Al/Ga,
   (G-II) ETM/Ln-LTM/BM-Metalloid (G-III) Al/Ga-LTM/BM-Metalloid, (G-IV)
   IIA-ETM/Ln-LTM/BM, (G-V) LTM/BM-Metalloid, (G-VI) ETM/Ln-LTM/BM and
   (G-VII) IIA-LTM/BM. where ETM. Ln, LTM, BM and IIA refer to early
   transition, lantlianide, late transition, group IIIB-IVB and group
   IIA-group metals, respectively. The main alloying element of ternary
   G-I, G-V and G-VII, ternary G-II and G-IV, and tertiary G-VI BMGs is the
   largest, intermediate and smallest atomic radius compared to the other
   alloying elements, respectively. The main alloying element of tertiary
   BMGs belonging to G-I. G-V. G-VI and G-VII is an element in the atomic
   pair with the largest and negative value of Delta H-mix (<(Delta H)under
   bar >(mix)(LN)). while the main element of ternary BMGs belonging to
   G-II and G-IV is independent of the atomic pair with <(Delta H)under bar
   >(mix)(LN). The characteristics of the main element derived for the
   ternary BMGs are directly applicable to multicomponent BMGs belonging to
   G-I. G-II, G-IV (Mg-based BMGs), G-V and G-VII. The main element can be
   the larger-sized element in the atomic pair with <(Delta H)under bar
   >(mix)(LN) or in the same group as the other elements for multicomponent
   BMGs belonging to G-III. G-IV (Be-containing Zr-based BMG) and G-VI. The
   main element of BMGs belonging to G-VI tends to change from the element
   with the smallest atomic radius in a ternary system to an element with a
   relatively large atomic size in a in multicomponent system. The change
   is due to an increase in glass-forming ability through multicomponent
   alloying of BMGs belonging to G-VI. The results of the classification of
   BMGs obtained in the present study are important for further development
   of BMGs, with the results providing a road map for the development of
   new BMG compositions.

AB Three kinds of hot rolled steel slabs, viz. high strength steel, bake
   hardened steel and low carbon steel, were oxidized isothermally between
   1100 and 1250 degrees C for up to 2 hr in 1 atm of air and an
   85%N-2-10%CO2-5%O-2 gas mixture. The steels were oxidized in a similar
   fashion in both the atmospheres. The oxidation process followed an
   initial linear rate law, which then gradually transformed to a nearly
   parabolic rate law. Thick, porous and nonadherent scales formed rapidly,
   due to the high oxidation temperature. The scales formed consisted of
   Fe2O3,(Fe2O3+Fe3O4), (Fe3O4+Fe2O3 +FeO) and (FeO+Fe3O4) from the outer
   surface. The presence of supersaturated oxygen beneath the scale
   resulted in grain boundary oxidation and the formation of internal oxide
   precipitates.

AB Bulk glass formation in multicomponent Fe-Co-Ni-Zr-B and
   Fe-Co-Ni-Zr-Nb-B alloy systems has been investigated by means of casting
   in a wedge shaped copper mould. It is observed that the critical
   thickness for glass formation, thermal stability of the glass and the
   undercooled liquid region increase upon the addition of niobium. The
   coercivity increases abruptly above the critical thickness owing to
   disappearance of the amorphous phase. Amorphous ribbons of both alloy
   systems have been prepared with various zirconium and boron contents to
   obtain a spectrum of values for glass transition, crystallisation
   temperature and undercooled liquid region. Kinetics studies of
   crystallisation have revealed that the activation energy increases with
   increasing undercooled liquid region.

AB In both reactions, Ni or Co in the starting oxide is displaced by Fe and
   the gamma-(Ni-Fe) or (Co-Fe) alloy is precipitated. In the reaction
   zone, composition gradients develop in both product phases, viz., the
   oxide and the alloy precipitate. The Ni (or Co) concentration of the
   alloy precipitate increases towards the reaction front. In the product
   oxide, the "inert" Mg diffuses toward the reaction front along with the
   Fe, while the Ni (or Co) diffusion is in the opposite direction, towards
   the Fe/boundary. The shape of the composition profiles for Mg and Fe in
   the product oxide suggests that cross-coefficient terms in the
   generalized flux equations contribute significantly to the cation flux.
   The parabolic rate constants of reactions involving Fe/(NixMg1-x)O
   decrease by nearly four orders of magnitude when x decreases from 1 to
   0.1.

AB Instrumental errors in microsegregation measurements in multicomponent
   alloys complicate the treatment of randomly sampled data. In this
   article, two new alloy-independent data treatment algorithms are
   presented that are capable of separating the effects of scatter in the
   data from the underlying segregation trends, assigning each measurement
   location a unique fraction solid. These new methods are physically
   reasonable and result in improved estimates of segregation parameters,
   particularly the solute partitioning at the dendrite tip. This is
   demonstrated by determining the microsegregation in four successive
   generations of single-crystal (SX) nickel-based superalloys. Artificial,
   noise-induced, tails commonly seen in the microsegregation profiles are
   also minimized. A methodology for evaluating sorting schemes is
   introduced that does not depend upon a priori knowledge of the
   partitioning direction. Comparison is made to both other sorting methods
   and CALPHAD predicted partition coefficients. Implications for alloy
   design are reported, illustrating the interaction between solute species
   such as Ru, Re, Co, and W.

   amorphous alloys with lambda > 0.1 exhibit glassy behavior, whereas
   alloys with lambda < 0.1 are nanocrystalline. Nanoglassy alloys occur
   when lambda approximate to 0.1. A large number of experimental findings
   in the literature supports the lambda criterion, rendering it a useful
   tool for the design and selection of glass-former systems and

AB In the ladle refining process, the FeO content of the ladle slag is of
   great importance in the chemistry as well as the energetics of the
   process. Optimisation of the process requires an accurate knowledge of
   the thermodynamic activities of FeO in the ladle slags. Due to the
   discrepancies in existing data, renewed attempts are being made at the
   Royal Institute of Technology to generate reliable data for binary,
   ternary and multicomponent slags containing FeO at steelmaking
   temperatures. In order to measure the activities of FeO in the slags, a
   gas equilibration technique was employed in the present work. The slags,
   kept in Pt crucibles were equilibrated with a CO-CO2-Ar gas mixture and
   quenched after equilibration. The chemical composition of the slag was
   analysed. From knowledge of the thermodynamics of the Fe-Pt system, the
   'FeO' activities in the slag were evaluated. The results of the present
   studies, together with other literature values, were optimised in the
   slag software THERMOSLAG developed at the Royal Institute of Technology,
   Sweden. The results of the optimisation are presented. Model
   calculations were performed with the KTH slag software THERMOSLAG using
   plant data from Ovako Steel, Hofors, Sweden. It was found that oxygen
   estimations in the metal from the FeO analyses of slags, obtained by a
   conventional sampling and analysis method were less reliable. Estimation
   of the oxygen levels utilising the sulphur partition between the slag
   and the metal were carried out using the THERMOSLAG software. Reasonable
   estimations of the oxygen content in the metal confirmed that this could
   be a very useful tool for the plant operator.

   libraries for combinatorial catalyst discovery. A 'gel-transfer'
   synthesis method is demonstrated that involves localized diffusion of
   aqueous precursor metal salts into a hydrated gel to establish spatially
   varying concentration fields. Electrodeposition is then used to transfer
   the gradient in metal precursors to a surface. To illustrate the utility
   of this method, a platinum-ruthenium-rhodium (PtxRuyRhz) catalyst
   gradient was constructed, and its reactivity towards several fuel cell
   reactions evaluated. An optical screening technique based upon the
   pH-sensitive fluorescence of quinine was used to visualize the spatial
   onset of reactivity on the ternary catalyst gradient. The evolution of
   protons from several reactions of interest for low temperature fuel
   cells was visualized by quinine fluorescence. The oxidation of hydrogen,
   carbon monoxide, methanol and ethanol were tested on the catalyst
   library. Catalyst regions that exhibited fluorescence (and hence the
   onset of activity) at lowest potentials were identified for each of the
   above reactions.

AB A new parameter is proposed to quantify the microchemical inhomogeneity
   (MCI) for a general multicomponent system and is applied to characterize
   some selected binary metal systems, i.e., the Ag-Ru, Ag-Co, Ni-Ru, and
   Ni-Hf systems, through molecular dynamics simulations. For the
   equilibrium immiscible Ag-Ru, Ag-Co, and Ni-Ru systems, ab initio
   calculations are performed to acquire some physical properties for
   fitting the respective n-body potentials. On the basis of the derived
   potentials, simulations reveal that in the highly immiscible Ag-Ru
   system, when the solute concentration is less than one of the critical
   values, i.e., either 6 atom % of Ru or 10 atom % of Ag, in the Ag-based
   and Ru-based solid solutions, respectively, the MCI is a small positive
   number and that when the solute concentration exceeds the critical
   values, i.e., falls in a composition range of 6-90 atom % of Ag, the MCI
   rises sharply to a large positive value ranging from 0.8 to 0.95,
   suggesting an incomplete-phase-separation tendency, which may result in
   forming a nanometer/subnanometer scaled structure. Similar simulations
   reveal that for the medium immiscible Ag-Co system, the MCI is about
   +0.7 within a composition range of 10-85 atom % of Ag and that for the
   Ni-Ru system, characterized by a nearly zero heat of formation, the MCI
   is nearly zero over the entire composition range, suggesting a possible
   metastable isomorphous phase diagram for the system, in which amorphous
   alloy, namely metallic glass. is hardly formed. In the contrast, for the
   miscible Ni-Hf system featuring a large negative heat of formation, the
   MCI is negative and is about -0.17 within a composition range of 25-80
   atom % Ni, in which a crystalline solid solution prefers to turn into an
   amorphous state, corresponding almost exactly to the glass-forming range
   known from experiments as well as from theoretical prediction.

AB Design of advanced materials in general calls for better understanding
   of phase transitions at service temperatures and relevant equilibrium
   phase diagrams. In the case of multicomponent alloys, it is often
   necessary to study phase transformations on model systems. Ni-Al-Cr-X
   quaternary systems (X = Co, W, Ti, Ta, etc.) are relatively simple yet
   sufficiently representative models for Ni-base superalloys. However,
   their complete thermodynamic description requires qualified knowledge of
   thermodynamic parameters for lower order systems as well as higher order
   correction terms.
   This work continues our previous studies on Ni-Al-Cr-(Co, W, Mo)
   systems. This time it is focused on titanium as the fourth element.
   Experimental alloys were prepared with respect to gamma + gamma' phases
   presence and studied by means of analytical electron microscopy after
   annealing at typical service temperatures. Experimentally identified
   types of phases are compared with those obtained by means of
   thermodynamic calculations. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   scanning Kerr microscopy and a vibrating sample magnetometer. 5-mm-wide
   and 35-mum-thick ribbons were obtained by hardening of melt in a rapidly
   rotating drum. Strong difference in the surface and bulk magnetic
   parameters of the ribbons is established. Domain walls (DW) parallel to
   the ribbon length are detected. It is shown that quasistatic

   alloys with large supercooled liquid region and good soft magnetic
   properties in (Fe,Co,Ni)(70)M10B20 (M = Zr, Nb, Ti, Ta) multicomponent

   were used to prepare 2-6 mm wide and 20-200 mum thick amorphous ribbons,
   as well as rods and ring-shaped samples with diameters and heights no
   larger than 3 mm, respectively. Electrical resistivity ((180-230) x

   A/m), magnetic permeability (up to 3 x 10(4), depending on composition),
   saturation magnetisation (mu(0)M(s) similar to 1.2 T), Curie temperature
   (T-C about 600 K) and core losses were determined. The influence of the

   have applied the spark-plasma sintering technique to a
   Fe65Co10Ga5P12C4B4 glassy alloy powder with a large supercooled liquid
   region of 50 K before crystallization. The existence of the supercooled
   liquid region enabled us to form a large size glassy alloy bulk of 20
   turn in diameter and 5 mm in thickness with a high relative density of
   99.7%. The resulting bulk glassy magnetic core of 20 mm in outer
   diameter, 10 mm in inner diameter and 4 mm. in thickness exhibits good
   soft magnetic properties, i.e. 1.20 T for saturation magnetization, 6
   A/m for coercive force and 8900 for maximum permeability. The good soft
   magnetic properties for the multicomponent Fe-based bulk glassy core are
   attributed to the combination of the high relative density and the
   maintenance of the single glassy structure. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All

   behaviour of MA powders has been investigated using a combination of
   pendulum magnetometer and in situ heating of mechanically alloyed powder
   in a transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The B2O3 oxides have no
   detectable effect on thermomagnetic behaviour. However, the ZrO2 was
   found to significantly influence the thermomagnetic behaviour of the

AB The interdiffusion in Co matrix/Al particle alloys and Co/Ni-based
   substrates was studied using electron probe microanalysis and was
   simulated with the software DICTRA. Alloys were prepared by mixing
   elemental powders and furnace melting under an inert atmosphere. The
   phases involved in the study were gamma (Ni-based or Co-based),
   beta-CoAl, and gamma'. The alloys were single-phase (gamma) as well as
   two-phase (gamma + beta and gamma + gamma'). Several equilibrium points
   in the Al-Co-Cr system were measured and compared with the calculated
   diagram at 1100 degreesC. The diffusion couples were prepared to produce
   combinations of selected alloys and were subjected to annealing at 1100
   degreesC for times up to 72 h. The diffusion calculations made with
   DICTRA were performed using the TCNI1 thermodynamic database together
   with mobility data collected from different literature sources. A
   literature survey on diffusion data of this system was performed, and
   comparisons with available data were made. The validity of the selected
   mobility data was checked with the composition profiles measured on some
   single-phase gamma/gamma diffusion couples. In the gamma + beta/gamma
   and gamma/gamma + gamma' diffusion couples, a regression of the
   dispersed phase (P or gamma') was observed due to the interdiffusion of
   Al. From combined experimental and theoretical results, the effects of
   temperature and coating thickness were determined as an input for a
   coating lifetime prediction model.

AB Bulk glass forming ability (GFA) of a multicomponent alloy of
   Fe67.0Co9.5Nd3.0Dy0.5B20 is studied by synthesizing it in shapes of thin
   ribbons, rods or cylinders, or pellets. The three samples are obtained
   with three different methods of melt spinning, copper mold casting, or
   mechanical attrition (of ribbons) followed by a hot compaction of
   derived alloy powder, respectively. A melt-spun ribbon of 50- to 100-mum
   thickness has a truly amorphous structure with two X-ray diffraction
   halos of wavevectors q(1) = 14.2 and q(3) = 33.0 nm(-1). A modified
   diffractogram consists of two halos q(1) = 14.5 and q(2) = 19.0nm(-1) in
   the rods (3.0-mm diameter) while of three halos q(1) = 13.4,q(2) =
   15.0andq(3) = 24.0 q(3) = 24.0 nm(-1) in the pellets (5- to 10-mm
   diameter and 3- to 5-mm thickness). A small value of coercivity H-c of
   7.1 kA/m in the rods or almost zero in the ribbons reveals soft magnetic
   behaviors characteristic of an amorphous structure of the alloy. An
   improved value of H-c = 188.5 kA/m develops in the hot compressed
   pellets of the powder at similar to 630 degreesC temperature. The
   pellets have some recrystallized alpha-Fe, Fe3B and R2Fe14B (R=Nd or Dy)
   nanocrystallites in a bulk amorphous composite structure. The results
   are analyzed with thermal analysis and microstructures of the samples.

AB Based on the free volume theory and the lattice model, the partition
   functions of pure solids and their mixtures were expressed. This
   resulted in the establishment of a thermodynamic model for solid
   solutions. The model naturally combines the excess entropy and excess
   enthalpy of a solution by means of new expressions of the
   configurational partition functions of solids and their mixtures derived
   from statistical thermodynamics, which is approximate to real solid
   solutions, that is S-E not equal 0 (V-E not equal 0) and H-E not equal
   0. It can describe the thermodynamic properties of partially miscible
   systems and predict the thermodynamic properties in a multicomponent
   solid solution system using only the related binary infinite dilute
   activity coefficients. The predicted activity coefficients from the
   model are in good agreement with the experimental data of the ternary
   solid dilutions. This shows that the prediction effect of the proposed
   model is of better stability and reliability because it has a good

AB A silver palladium (Ag/Pd) alloy powder is used as an example material
   to illustrate potential applications of electrophoretic deposition (EPD)
   in electronics manufacturing, in particular the forming of multilayer
   devices. The dispersion and deposition of the Ag/Pd powder in acetic
   acid is characterized. It is found that deposition can be explained by
   the direct action of electrostatic force on individual particles.
   Depositions of this Ag/Pd powder are then used to demonstrate: forming
   of a continuous layer on a rigid substrate; forming of continuous layers
   in laminated and sintered BaTiO3 multilayers; and incorporation of
   patterned depositions into a multilayer by either overcasting the
   patterned deposition with a particulate slip to form a multicomponent
   tape, or direct lamination of the patterned deposition to a low
   temperature co-fired ceramic (LTCC) tape. It is shown that electrically
   conducting layers can be formed at an average thickness of only two
   times the diameter of the starting powder. Continuous conductor lines
   thirty times the average diameter of the starting powder were formed.

   phase. The calculated composition profiles, interdiffusion coefficients,
   phase fraction profiles, and location of Kirkendall porosity are
   compared with experimental results. To treat diffusion in the IN718
   alloy, iron and carbon are added to the existing diffusion mobility
   database using previous assessment work and new assessments of Fe-Al and
   Fe-Co.

AB The thermal behavior and properties of immiscible blends of polystyrene
   (PS) and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) with and without PS-b-PMMA
   diblock copolymer at different melt blending times were investigated by
   use of a differential scanning calorimeter. The weight fraction of PS in
   the blends ranged from 0.1 to 0.9. From the measured glass transition
   temperature (T-g) and specific heat increment (DeltaC(p)) at the T-g,
   the PMMA appeared to dissolve more in the PS phase than did the PS in
   the PMMA phase. The addition of a PS-b-PMMA diblock copolymer in the
   PS/PMMA blends slightly promoted the solubility of the PMMA in the PS
   and increased the interfacial adhesion between PS and PMMA phases during
   processing. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) showed that the
   presence of the PS-b-PMMA diblock copolymer in the PS/PMMA blends
   afforded protection against thermal degradation and improved their
   thermal stability. Also, it was found that the PS was more stable
   against thermal degradation than that of the PMMA over the entire
   heating range. (C) 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
