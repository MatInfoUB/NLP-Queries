TI Novel cobalt base superalloy and its high-temperature flow behavior
SO RARE METALS
AB A novel cobalt base superalloy containing titanium and aluminum was investigated through metallography, tensile test, and high-temperature isothermal compression deformation. The results show that proper content of titanium and aluminum with can improve the strength and ductility of the cobalt base superalloy. The Co-3(Ti,Al) compound with L 12 structure precipitates when the novel superalloy is aged at 800 degrees C for 20 h. The E phase with hcp structure also precipitates when the superalloy is deformed by 28% and then aged at 650 degrees C for 4 h. The E phase can exist at 800 degrees C. ne superalloy has excellent high-temperature mechanical properties. Its maximum flow stress at 850 degrees C is in the range of 360-475 MPa when the strain rate is between 0.0021 and 2.1 s(-1). The flow stress of the superalloy during high-temperature deformation can be described by the Zener-Hollomon parameter with a hot deformation activation energy of 397 kJ.mol(-1).

TI Brazing and wide gap repair of X-40 using Ni-base alloys
SO JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING FOR GAS TURBINES AND POWER-TRANSACTIONS OF THE
   ASME
AB Co-base superalloys are commonly used for vanes and parts of the combustion chamber in gas turbine engines. The Co-base superalloys are primarily solid solution strengthened and have good resistance to hot corrosion, creep, and thermal fatigue. In particular Co-base alloy X-40 was used to fabricate the first stage NGV airfoils of T56 series engines: inspections after service have revealed that X-40 airfoils suffered from severe thermal fatigue damages. In this study, a new braze repair scheme is proposed; in which Ni-base alloys are used to repair the X-40 substrate in both narrow and wide gap configurations. Metallographic examination, X-ray mapping, and energy dispersive Spectroscopy semiquantitative compositional analyses were carried out to study the microstructures in the braze joint in the as-brazed condition and after thermal exposure at 950 degrees C. The results obtained so far suggest the formation of Cr-rich borides, eutectic phases, and various carbides in the joint. No TCP phases were found in the brazed joint and base metals adjacent to the joint. The high carbon content in the alloy X-40 may have played an important role in preventing the formation of TCP phases,during brazing and subsequent thermal exposure.

TI Role of Re and Co on microstructures and gamma ' coarsening in single
   crystal superalloys
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB Seven alloys containing different contents of rhenium and cobalt are investigated to explore systematically the effects of rhenium and cobalt on microstructures and gamma' coarsening. The alloys are exposed to different periods at 950 degrees C and 1050 degrees C. In the alloys containing rhenium, gamma' coarsening is controlled by diffusion. Diffusion coefficient rises with the decreasing of rhenium and the increasing of cobalt. In the alloys containing 4 wt.% Re and Co free, there is TCP phase precipitation when exposed at 1050 degrees C. Additions of 3 wt.% Co to the alloy suppress the formation of TCP phase completely. Co reduces or eliminates the adverse effects of Re. In the Re-free alloys, there is no TCP formation and the coarsening mechanisms are complex. The competition in rate-controlling between diffusion and interface reaction on coarsening kinetics is dependent on the elements and the diffusion behavior. A model describing the process of forming rafts is also established. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

CL Noordwijk, NETHERLANDS
AB The effects of platinum (Pt) layer on phase transformation and oxidation behavior of MCrAlY (M = Co, Ni) coatings were investigated by isothermal and cyclic oxidation tests at temperature of 1100 degrees C. Pt layer of about 5 mu m thickness was deposited on MAR M247-DS superalloy byan electroplating method, and then the MCrAlY layers were coated with air plasma spray (APS) and vacuum plasma spray (VPS) methods. APS process creates internal oxides and interface voids, whereas the VPS process shows fewer voids in the interface between the MCrAlY layer and the superalloy used as substrate. The oxides and voids formed in the APS process deteriorate the oxidation resistance, indicating that the oxides and voids are transferred to Al2O3 compounds during the oxidation tests. The Pt layer shows a strong affinity with Ni element and a weak affinity with Co and Cr elements, resulting in the formation of beta-(Ni,Pt)Al phase. The Pt pre-coated layer forces down for the diffusion of soluble elements to get the reduced deplete zone in the superalloy. The VPS process enhances the oxidation resistance of the MCrAlY coating and shows better bonding strength, owing to the generation of homogenous microstructure in the coating and less processing defects.

AB The high temperature deformation behavior and flow instabilities of Ni-Fe-Co base superalloy, INCONEL alloy 783 during hot working process were investigated with process maps consisting of a power dissipation of dynamic materials model (DMM) and various flow instability criteria. In order to establish the processing map of INCONEL alloy 783, hot compression tests were carried out under different temperature and strain rate conditions, with true strain up to 0.7. On the basis of the comparison between processing maps and microstructural analysis, the reliability of various flow instability criteria was estimated. Finally the useful instability criterion for predicting the forming defects was suggested through the compression test results and experimental observations of actual ring rolling process of INCONEL alloy 783.

AB Recently, operating temperature of USC plants is getting higher and planned up to 700 degrees C. Austenitic superalloys are promising instead of ferritic heat resistant steels because of necessity of high strength at around 650-700 degrees C. In general, austenitic Ni base superalloys indicate higher creep rupture strength than ferritic heat resistant steels, however their thermal expansions are higher, creep rupture ductilities lower, and costs higher. Firstly, to obtain low thermal expansion we have noticed Mo containing superalloy, then investigated the effect of Mo and Co content, the amount of gamma prime phase, Al/Ti ratio in gamma prime phase on thermal expansion, tensile properties, and creep rupture properties, compared with conventional Mo containing alloy252 as a reference. As a result, a developed superalloy, although it contains no Co, combined with modified heat treatment, indicated much higher creep rupture elongation than Alloy252, keeping low thermal expansion and high creep rupture strength close to Alloy252.
   Furthermore, Creep-rupture properties at 700 degrees C up to about 20,000h were evaluated for long-term applications, and weldability and mechanical properties of weld joint at 750 degrees C were also investigated for boiler tube applications.

AB Nimonic 80A, a Ni-base superalloy mainly strengthened by Al and Ti to form gamma'-Ni-3 (Al, Ti) precipitation in Ni-Cr solid solution strengthened austenite matrix, has been used in different industries for more than half century (especially for aero-engine application). In consideration of high strengths and corrosion resistance both Shanghai Turbine Company (STC) has adopted Nimonic 80A as bucket material for ultra-super-critical (USC) turbines with the steam parameters of 600 degrees C, 25MPa. First series of two 1000MW USC steam turbines made by Shanghai Turbine Co. were already put in service on the end of 2006.
   Large amount of Nimonic 80A with different sizes are produced in Special Steel Branch of BAOSTEEL, Shanghai. Vacuum induction melting and Ar protected atmosphere electro-slag remelting (VIM+PESR) process has been selected for premium quality high strength Nimonic 80A. For higher mechanical properties the alloying element adjustment, optimization of hot deformation and heat treatment followed by detail structure characterization have been done in this paper.
   The Chinese premium quality high strength Nimonic 80A can fully fulfill the USC turbine bucket requirements.

AB This paper presents recent progress on the phase diagrams and design for Co-base alloys, focusing on magnetic recording media, ferromagnetic Co-Ni-Al-base shape memory alloys, half-metallic Heusler alloys and Co-base superalloys. The calculated miscibility gap between ferromagnetic and paramagnetic states in the Co-X(X: Cr, Mo, W) systems has been found to agree well with the experimental results, strongly implying that the magnetic induced phase separation is responsible for the compositional heterogeneity in Co-base magnetic recording media. New ferromagnetic Co-Ni-Al shape memory alloys have also been developed based on phase diagrams, where the introduction of gamma(Al structure) to the beta(B2) matrix was found to drastically improve the ductility. The phase stability of half-metal Heusler Co-Cr base alloys is discussed in relation to the order-disorder transition, Curie temperature and the spin polarization ratio. Finally, the possibility of potent strengthening of Co-base superalloys by precipitation of the gamma'(L1(2)) phase is presented.

AB Cobalt based Superalloy containing Tungsten, Nickel and Chromium as alloying elements, is extensively used in fabrication of high temperature components of launch vehicle systems. Microstructural variation with respect to grain size has an important role to play in mechanical properties of this alloy. Microstructural changes were incorporated by varying the heat treatment temperature and effect of such changes on the mechanical properties at room temperature as well as at high temperature is investigated. Increase in grain size and decrease in strength and ductility is observed for the alloy heat treated at relatively higher temperature.

AB Long-term creep and rupture data of NIMS Creep Data Sheets show that the time to rupture at a minimum creep rate of 10(-5) %/h is longer than 105 h for most ferritic steels, while it is shorter than 105 h for most austenitic steels, Ni base and Co base superalloys. This is correlated with the larger total elongation in ferritic steels than in austenitic steels and in Ni base and Co base superalloys at a minimum creep rate of 10(-5)%/h. However, 67% of the average stress to cause rupture at the end of 105 It is lower than the stress to produce a minimum creep rate of 10-5 %/h for all the materials examined. This indicates that the ASME allowable stress in a high-temperature creep region is determined by creep rupture data but not by creep strain data. The creep and creep rate curves are compared between 2.25Cr-1Mo steel and 18Cr-8Ni austenitic steel at approximately the same minimum creep rate. 18Cr-8Ni austenitic steel reaches a minimum creep rate in shorter time and spends shorter time in the acceleration creep before creep rupture than 2.25Cr-1Mo steel at low stress and long time conditions. This is correlated with different microstructure evolution during creep. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Effect of alloying elements for designing of advanced co-free ni-base

SO JOURNAL OF THE JAPAN INSTITUTE OF METALS
AB A second-generation Co-free Ni base single crystal superalloy, TMS-82C (Ni-0Co-4.9Cr-1.0Mo-8.7W-5.3Al-6.0Ta-2.4Re-0.1Hf, in mass%) was derived from its base alloy, TMS-82+ (Ni-7.8Co-4.9Cr-1.9Mo-8.7W-5.3Al-6.0Ta-2.4Re-0.1Hf, in mass%), which had been successfully engine tested. The absent of Co can eliminate the product of isotope Co-60 from radioactive decay, and it can improve the maintainability of the gas turbine engine. However, the removal of Co had decreased the creep strength of TMS-82C. To further improve its creep strength, five additional alloys were designed with the addition of 0.5 mass% Mo, W, Ti, Ta and Re to TMS-82C, respectively. Results indicated that creep properties of all five alloys performed better than that of TMS-82C under 900 degrees C/392 MPa and 1000 degrees C/245 MPa conditions. W-bearing alloy exhibits similar creep property comparing to that of TMS-82+ under the 900 degrees C/392 MPa condition.

AB Both aviation and land based turbine components such as vanes/nozzles, combustion chambers, liners, and transition pieces often degrade and crack in service. Rather than replacing with new components, innovative repairs can help reduce overhaul and maintenance costs. These components are cast from either Co-based solid solution superalloys such as FSX-414, or Ni-based gamma prime precipitation strengthened superalloys such as IN738. The nominal compositions of FSX-414 and IN738 are Co-29.5Cr-10.5Ni-7W-2Fe [max]-0.25C-0.012B and Ni-0.001B -0.17C-8.5Co-16Cr-1.7Mo-3.4Al-2.6W-1.7Ta-2Nb-3.4Ti-0.1Zr, respectively.
   Diffusion brazing has been used for over four decades to repair cracks and degradation on these types of components. Typically, braze materials utilized for component repairs are Ni and Co-based braze fillers containing B and/or Si as melting point depressants. Especially when repairing wide cracks typically found on industrial gas turbine components, these melting point depressants can form brittle intermetallic boride and silicide phases that effect mechanical properties such as low cycle and thermal fatigue. The objective of this work is to investigate and evaluate the use of hyper-eutectic Ni-Cr-Hf and Ni-Cr-Zr braze filler metals, where the melting point depressant is no longer B, but Hf and/or Zr. Typically, With joint gaps or crack widths less than 0.15mm, the braze filler metal alone can be utilized. For cracks greater than 0.15mm, a superalloy powder is mixed with the braze filler metal to enable wide cracks to be successfully brazed repaired. As a means of qualifying the diffusion braze repair, both metallurgical and mechanical property evaluations were carried out. The metallurgical evaluation consisted of optical and scanning electron microscopy, and microprobe analysis. The diffusion brazed area consisted of a fine-grained equiaxed structure, with carbide phases, gamma [gamma] dendrites, flower shaped/rosette gamma-gamma' [gamma-gamma prime] eutectic phases and Ni(7)Hf(2), Ni(5)HF, or Ni(5)Zr intermetallic phases dispersed both intergranularly and intragranularly. Hardness tests showed that the Ni-Hf and Ni-Zr intermetallic phase only has a hardness range of 250Hv to 400Hv; whereas, the typical Cr-boride phases have hardness ranges from 800Hv to 1000Hv. Therefore the hardness values of the Ni-HF and Ni-Zr intermetallic phases are 2.5-3.2 times softer than the Cr-boride intermetallic phases. As a result the LCF properties of the wide gap Ni-Cr-Hf and Ni-Cr-Zr brazed joints are superior to those of the Ni-Cr-B braze filler metals. The mechanical property evaluations were tensile tests at both room temperature and elevated temperature, stress rupture tests from 760 degrees C-1093 degrees C and finally low cycle fatigue [LCF] tests, the latter being one of the most important and severe tests to conduct, since the cracks being repaired are thermal fatigue driven. At the optimum braze thermal cycle; the mechanical test results achieved were a minimum of 80% and sometimes equivalent to that of the base metals properties.

AB Four turbine blades having a nominal B-1900 composition were submitted for failure analysis after cracks were detected or Z-notch failure had occurred at the shroud. The blades were weld repaired at the shroud edges and returned to service, only to fail after several hours. The blade repairs involved machining away the original material, and then inert gas tungsten arc weld repairing with a Co-base hardface and B-1900 filler alloy. Analysis of the broken blades found that they had failed from fatigue. This fatigue was the result of cracks in the heat-affected zones of the blades created from liquation at the grain boundaries and residual stresses that could not be relieved through the low-ductility weldments. Cracks also developed from precipitation of brittle secondary phases at the coating-weldment interdiffusion zone.

AB Recent advances in coal combustion have made coal a cleaner, more viable source for power generation. Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) plants pair conventional steam turbines and coal gas turbines. The overall efficiency of each system is largely dependent on the maximum operating temperature of the system, which is limited by the available materials. Superalloys have long been used as a turbine material due to their high temperature strength and general resistance to oxidation. Superalloy GTD-111 DS is currently being used as components in steam turbine engine such as turbine blades and discs and is now being introduced to the syngas environment, which consists of H-2, CO, CH4, and H2S in addition to H2O. H2S is highly corrosive and complicates the corrosion process. The high temperature corrosion behavior of a directionally solidified superalloy, GTD-111 DS has been studied using thermogravimtric analysis coupled with metallographic studies. Parabolic oxidation behavior was observed for test environments including dry and wet air. Simulated syngas environments show aggressive sulfidization that leads to massive sample damage. In the case of wet syngas environments, a protective oxide layer was observed which seem to increase the samples ability to resist further corrosion.

AB The 1150 degrees C oxidation behavior of gamma + gamma'-based alloys containing up to 20 at.% Pt and 15-22 at.% Al was investigated in an effort to further develop and optimize alternative bond coating compositions for advanced thermal barrier coating systems. It was found that the co-addition of Pt and Hf was extremely beneficial to oxidation resistance, to the extent that Ni-20Al-20Pt-Hf and Ni-20Al-10Pt-Hf alloys oxidized at significantly slower rates than a Ni-50Al-15Pt beta-NiAl alloy. Moreover it was found that there is an optimum Hf content that depends on Pt content in the alloy. A feasible method to deposit Pt + Hf-modified gamma + gamma' coatings having overall compositions closely approaching those targeted (Ni-Al15-20-Pt15-20-Hf) on the basis of the bulk-alloy study was subsequently developed. Cyclic oxidation testing of a representative gamma + gamma' coating at 1150 degrees C in air revealed the absence of surface rumpling and excellent compatibility with the superalloy substrate as major advantages compared to traditional Pt-modified beta-NiAl coatings.

CY FEB, 2006

AB Nanostructural features of nickel-base superalloys as revealed by atom probe field ion microscopy (APFIM) and atom probe tomography (APT) are reviewed. The more salient information provided by these techniques is discussed through an almost exhaustive analysis of literature over the last 30 years. Atom probe techniques are shown to be able to measure the composition of tiny gamma' precipitates, a few nanometers in size, and to reveal chemical order within these precipitates. Phase separation kinetics in model NiCrAl alloys was investigated with both 3DAP and Monte-Carlo simulation. Results are shown to be in good agreement. Plane by plane analysis of {001} planes of Ni3Al-type gamma' phase makes it possible to estimate the degree of order as well as the preferential sites of various addition elements (Ti, Cr, Co, W, Ta, Re, Ru, etc.) included in superalloys. Clustering effects of Re in the gamma solid solution were also exhibited. Due to its ultrahigh depth resolution, the microchemistry of interfaces and grain boundaries can be characterized on an atomic scale. Grain boundaries in Astroloy or N18 superalloys were found to be enriched in B, Mo, and Cr and Al depleted.

TI Stability of nanoscale co-precipitates in a superalloy: A combined
   first-principles and atom probe tomography study
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Inconel 718 is a nickel-iron based superalloy widely used in the aerospace industry. Its high temperature strength is attributed to the thermal stability of dense nanoscale precipitates gamma' [Ni3Al] and gamma '' [Ni3Nb]. There is experimental evidence that gamma' and gamma '' often form co-precipitates gamma'/gamma '' or sandwichlike structure gamma'/gamma ''/gamma' or gamma ''/gamma'/gamma ''. But how they stabilize under heat treatment or in service is still not well-understood. We have investigated the interfacial structure and chemistry of fine co-precipitates Ni-3(Al, Ti, Nb)/Ni3Nb(gamma'/gamma '') in Inconel 718, using both first-principles density functional theory calculation and the three-dimensional atom probe technique. Our calculations confirm that Al atoms in the gamma' phase segregate to the gamma'/gamma '' interface. The enrichment of Al helps to impede the assimilation of Nb from gamma' to gamma '' and reject Al from gamma '' to gamma', and therefore keeps such secondary precipitates at fine size. In the absence of Ti in the gamma' phase, our calculations predict an enhanced driving force for Al to accumulate at the interface. We have also characterized the microstructure of the gamma'/gamma '' interface for an Inconel 718 sample taken from a commercial compressor blade serviced in an airplane engine for over 10 000 h at a temperature up to 600 degrees C using three-dimensional atom probe analysis. Interestingly, we find that Al enrichment sustains long-term service, suggesting that the coarsening of secondary precipitates is interface-controlled. The success of first-principles density functional theory computation in reproducing the experimental observation encourages extensive application of this powerful tool in the study of precipitates in superalloys.

TI Microstructures evolution of a Ni-base superalloy after long-term aging
   at 750 degrees C
SO JOURNAL OF IRON AND STEEL RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL
AB The microstructures evolution of a new type Ni-base superalloy used as a component of gas turbine engine has been investigated after long-term aging at 750 degrees C for 2000h. The results indicate that TCP, a harmful phase greatly affects the mechanical properties of the alloy, is un-precipitated in the aging process. gamma' phase is precipitated in two kinds of sizes during long-term aging. The shape of larger one is transit from spherical to cubic with prolonging of aging time. The M23C6 carbide formed mainly by Cr, and other elements such as Al, Ti, Co and Mo is also precipitated in both gamma matrix and grain boundaries, and the quantities of the carbide increase gradually with the increasing of aging time.

TI Life-time determining spalling mechanisms of NiCoCrAlRE/EB-PVD zirconia
   TBC systems
SO MATERIALWISSENSCHAFT UND WERKSTOFFTECHNIK
AB The mechanisms that control the lifetime of thermal barrier coating (TBC) systems have been traced by two particular overlay bondcoats serving as model systems: superalloy pins (IN100, CMSX-4) with two alternative NiCoCrAlRE (RE: Hf, Y) bond coat compositions (i) NiCoCrAlY without and (ii) with co-dopants of silicon and hafnium. On top an electron-beam physical-vapor deposited (EB-PVD) yttria partially stabilized zirconia (YPSZ) TBC commonly mixed with 2 wt.% hafnia, or, rarely with 10 wt.%, was applied. The test pins were thermo-cycled at 1100 and 1150 degrees C until failure. Identical lifetimes in cyclic tests on YPSZ TBCs with 2 (relatively high sintering rate) and 10 wt.% hafnia (relatively low sintering rate) preclude an effect of diffusion mechanisms of the YPSZ TBC on lifetime. The fit of lifetimes and test temperatures to Arrhenius-type relationships gives activation energies for failure. These energies agree with the activation energies for anion and cation diffusion in alumina for the respective bondcoat variant:
   (i) for the NiCoCrAlY/TBC system for O-2- diffusion in alumina,
   (ii) for the NiCoCrAlYSiHf/TBC system for Al3+ diffusion in alumina. SEM and EDS investigations of the thermally grown oxides (TGOs) confirm the mechanisms responsible for TBC failure.as indicated by activation energies. Two categories of failure can be distinguished: (i) NiCoCrAlY coatings fail by an "adhesive mode of failure" along smooth bond coat/TGO interfaces driven by a critical TGO thickness. (ii) NiCoCrAlYSiHf coatings fail later and more reluctantly by a "cohesive" crack mode via de-cohesion at the TGO/TBC interface. In the latter case a quasi-integrity of the crack-affected TGO is lengthily maintained U to failure by a crack-pinning mechanism which runs via Al(3+)psupply from the bondcoat.

AB The microstructure of a newly developed Co-base superalloy with enhanced high-temperature strength has been investigated using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and three-dimensional atom probe (3DAP) techniques. It mainly consists of a typical gamma/gamma' (FCC/L1(2)) structure and a plate-shaped AB(3)-type (Ni, Co, Cr)(3)(Ti, Al) intermetallic compound with hexagonal structure (a similar to 5.1 angstrom and c similar to 12.5 angstrom). gamma' is formed with a bimodal distribution and fine gamma' has a cuboidal morphology. Cr and Co are enriched in the gamma phase, while Ti, Al and Ni are enriched in the gamma' phase. W and Mo are more or less uniformly distributed in both gamma and gamma'. Chemical composition analysis by 3DAP suggests that the plate-shaped phase has a higher Ti and lower Al content compared to that of gamma' phase, and the concentration of Ti, Co and Ni has a periodic variation along c-axis with a period of 12.5 angstrom in the plate-shaped phase.

TI Isothermal oxidation behavior of single-crystal Ni-base superalloy
   containing rhenium in air
SO RARE METAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING
AB The high temperature oxidation behavior of the single-crystal Ni-base superalloy DD32 containing rhenium was investigated at 900 degrees C and 1000 degrees C in air by using SEM, XRD, and SEM/EDAX. It is found that there are two oxidation stages in the oxidation kinetics curves at 900 degrees C and 1000 degrees C. In the initial stage, the mass gain rapidly increases and basically obeys a parabola law due to the formation and growth of NiO. In the second oxidation stage, it obeys the asymptotic level linear law with the oxidation time increasing to a critical time when the mass gain goes to be slow, and the Kp value corresponds to the formation and growth of Al2O3. There are three layers for the oxidation film at 900 degrees C and 1000 degrees C: an outer layer of columnar (Ni,Co)O, an intermediate layer mainly composed of complex oxides and a small amount of spinels, and a continuous inner layer of alpha-Al2O3. The phase rich in Re and W precipitates may play a role of "diffusion barrier", which is distributed in the intermediate layer during oxidation, effectively decreases the diffusion rate of Al element in the substrate outward. As a result, a continuous oxide layer of Al2O3 is formed in the inner layer to restrain the growth of oxide film and decrease the oxidation rate.

TI Hot corrosion of the Ni-20%Cr alloy and waspaloy immersed in Na2SO4
SO TETSU TO HAGANE-JOURNAL OF THE IRON AND STEEL INSTITUTE OF JAPAN
AB The nickel-based superalloy of Waspaloy and the Ni-20%Cr alloy were hot-corroded in the molten NaZSO(4) under the flowing air for up to 720 ks at 1273 to 1473K to clarify the sulfidation/oxidation behavior by means of XRD, OM, SEM, EPMA and TEM. They formed a subscale which was composed of intergranular and intragranular compounds in the alloy interior together with an external scale on the alloy. The kinetic of the subscale formations was followed by a parabolic rate law. The external scale and subscale formed on the Ni-20%Cr alloy consisted of CrzO(3) and CrzS(3), Cr;S-6 and a small amount of Cr2O3, respectively. Those formed on Waspaloy consisted of (Cr - Co Ti)(2)O-3 and TiS-, Cr2S3, Cr3S6, AlO3 and (Cr - Co - Ti)zO(3), respectively. In order to observe directly the three dimensional morphology of the subscale, a metal matrix was dissolved using an organic solution that does not dissolve the metallic sulfides or oxides which constitute the subscale. The organic solution developed in this investigation consisted of bromine, cetylpyridinium bromide and acetonitrile. The SEM images of the three-dimensional subscale extracted from the corroded alloys with the organic solution showed that the intergranular compounds formed thin walls of sulfides and oxides along grain boundaries and an intragranular sulfide formed isolated needles in the alloy grain interior near the external scale.

SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB The results of investigations of boron and carbon segregations, boride and carbide phases forming in various elements of the structure of ingots of the Ni-base superalloy EP962 have been presented. The methods of light metallography (LM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray spectral microanalysis (XRSMA), high sensitive track autoradiography on boron via the nuclear reaction B-10(n, alpha)(7), Li and activation autoradiography on carbon via the reaction C-12(d, n)N-13 were used. Boron segregation and precipitation of boride phase in interdendritic regions and on the grain boundaries were established. Composition of boride phase was found to be (Ni0.32Cr0.22Nb0.14Mo0.11Co0.13W0.02Al0.02Ti0.01)B-0.67, which is of M3B2 type. Formation of the non-equilibrium gamma '-gamma eutectic in interdendritic regions causes microliquation of Cr, Nb, Mo, Co, W and B in the crown of gamma '-gamma eutectic that results in formation of boride particles in the crown of gamma '-gamma eutectic. Carbon was found mainly forming carbide particles in interdendritic regions. Composition of carbide particles was found by the XRSMA as (Nb0.6Ti0.22Ni0.10Cr0.02W0.01Hf0.01)C. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Microstructural evolution, interfacial toughness and damage initiation of Y2O3 partially stabilised ZrO2 thermal barrier coatings (TBCs), which have been deposited by electro-beam physical vapour deposition on NiCoCrAlYHf coated superalloy substrate, were studied as a function of thermal cycles at 1150 degrees C. Interfacial toughness of TBC systems was measured by indentation method. The results show that bond coat (BC) is composed of beta-(Ni,Co)Al and gamma solid solution at the initial cycles. beta phase is completely transformed into gamma at 185 cycles. The thermally grown oxide (TGO), which consists of an Al2O3 layer and a thin spinel layer, has a high growth rate and grows irregularly because of preferential oxidation of Hf rich phases in the BC. This TBC system has a larger critical TGO thickness for failure. The thickness of TGO at planar place is approximately 10 mu m when the TBCs spalled. Interfacial toughness decreases substantially at the initial stage of thermal cycling.

AB The lattice parameters and the local lattice distortions around solute atoms in fcc-Ni solutions were studied using first-principles calculations. The solute atoms considered include Al, Co, Cr, Hf, Mo, Nb, Re, Ru, Ta, Ti, and W. The calculations were performed using supercells with 1 solute atom and 107 solvent atoms. It is found that the atomic size difference, the electronic interactions, and the magnetic spin relations between the solute and solvent atoms all contribute to the lattice distortions. Based on the results from first-principles calculations, the linear composition coefficients of fcc Ni lattice parameter for different solutes were determined, and the lattice parameters of multicomponent Ni-base superalloys as a function of solute composition were predicted. The results are compared with existing experimental measurements, and good agreements are obtained for both the compositional dependence of lattice parameters and the local lattice distortions.

AB Thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) are now currently used in gas turbine engines' blades and vanes. A typical duplex TBCs system comprises of a plasma-sprayed thermally insulating ZrO2 alloy top coat applied over an oxidation-resistant MCrAlY (M=Ni and/or Co) bond coat. In this investigation, the substrates of Hastelloy-X superalloy coupons were first sprayed with a Ni-22Cr-10Al-1Y bond coat and then with an yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) top coat in which the yttria contents were varied from 6.1 wt.% to 19.5 wt.%. After that, the plasma-sprayed yttria-stabilized zirconia/MCrAlY TBCs were glazed using a pulsed CO, laser. The hot corrosion resistance of plasma-sprayed and laser-glazed zirconia thermal barrier coatings at 910 degrees C was investigated using coupons on which were deposited Na2SO4 and/or V2O5. The results of the high temperature corrosion tests showed that the lifetimes of the plasma-sprayed TBCs with different yttria content were all increased about fourfold by laser-glazing in the V2O5 salt contained test. The lifetime decreased with increasing the amount of deposited V2O5 salt. The X-ray diffraction showed that the reaction between yttria (Y2O3) and V2O5 produced YVO4, leaching Y2O3 from the YSZ and causing progressive cubic, tetragonal to monoclinic phase destabilization transformation. The failure of the TBCs was initiated and propagated mainly within the top coat, near the top coat-bond coat interface. Both adding Na2SO4 and a reaction between Na2SO4 and the bond coat can probably reduce the strain accommodation of the top coat. There are no significant corrosion cyclic life differences for TBC with various YSZ top coats for both plasma-sprayed and laser-glazed TBC. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Use of plasma spray technology for deposition of high temperature
   oxidation/corrosion resistant coatings - a review
SO MATERIALS AND CORROSION-WERKSTOFFE UND KORROSION
AB High temperature oxidation is one of the main failure modes of the hot-section components in gas turbines, boilers, waste incinerations, diesel engines, coal gasification plants, chemical plants and other energy generation systems. In such applications the use of Fe-, Ni- and Co-based alloys, especially of superalloys is well known. The superior mechanical strength and good corrosion resistance of the superalloys at high temperature make them favorites for such applications. However, the presence of combustion gases constitutes an extreme environment and hot corrosion is inevitable when superalloys are used at high temperatures for long durations of time. Therefore these alloys need to be protected against this type of oxidation. Several countermeasures have been suggested in the literature to combat the same. One such countermeasure against hot corrosion and oxidation constitutes the deposition of protective coatings on these alloys. Among the various techniques used for deposition of coatings, plasma spraying is a versatile technology that has been successful as a reliable cost-effective solution for many industrial problems. It allows the spraying of a wide range of high performance materials from superalloys and refractory intermetallic compounds to ceramics with continuously increasing commercial applications. Furthermore it does not cause deterioration of the substrate alloys, and relatively thick coatings can be formed with high deposition rates. In this paper the technique of plasma spraying has been detailed and the role of plasma sprayed coatings to arrest high temperature oxidation has been discussed with the help of a comprehensive literature survey. The main focus of this investigation is the studies related to plasma sprayed Ni-CrA1Y, Ni-Cr, Nickel aluminide and Co-based coatings.

TI Oxidation resistance of Pt containing gamma-Ni+gamma '-Ni3Al alloys
SO JOURNAL OF THE JAPAN INSTITUTE OF METALS
AB The oxidation behavior of Pt + Hf-modified gamma-Ni+gamma'-Ni3Al alloys containing up to 20 at%Pt and either 15 or 20 a%Al was studied by oxidizing the alloys in air at 1150 degrees C under both isothermal and thermal cycling conditions. It was found that the co-addition of Pt and Hf was extremely beneficial to oxidation resistance, to the extent that Ni-20Al-20Pt-0.4Hf and Ni-20Al-10Pt0.4Hf alloys (all compositions are in at%) oxidized at significantly slower rates than that of a Ni-50Al-15Pt beta-NiAl alloy. A Ni-20A1-5Pt-0.3Hf alloy also showed relatively good oxidation resistance, with the oxidation rate being almost the same as that obtained for Ni-50Al-15Pt alloy. Over a period of up to 500 one-hour oxidation cycles, no oxide spallation from the modified gamma + gamma' alloys was observed. From cross-sectional SEM examination coupled with X-ray diffraction analyses, it was found that a compact and planar exclusive scale layer of alpha-Al2O3 formed on the Ni-20Al-20Pt-0.4Hf alloy. By contrast, Ni-20Al-10Pt-0.4Hf and Ni-20Al-5Pt-0.3Hf alloys formed a very thin outer layer of NiAl2O4 and a planar inner layer of of alpha-Al2O3. The thickness of this inner Al2O3 layer increased with increasing oxidation time relative to that of the NiAl2O4 layer, suggesting that the latter primarily formed during the initial stages of scale formation. Both NiO and NiAl2O4 were found in the outer scales formed on the Ni-20Al-0.3Hf and Ni-15Al-0 similar to 10Pt-M alloys, with the thickness of these oxide layers decreasing with increasing Pt content in the alloys. Further, it was found that the extent of internal HfO2 formation decreased significantly with increasing in Pt content, to the extent that no HfO2 was found in the oxidized Ni-20Al-20Pt-0.4Hf alloy. Inferences for the observed beneficial effects of Pt promoting protective Al2O3 formation and decreasing the tendency for Hf to oxidize in gamma + gamma' alloys will be presented.

AB In advanced industrial gas-turbine systems, there has been a great demand for new single crystal (SC) superalloys with an excellent combination of high-temperature creep strength, hot-corrosion resistance and oxidation resistance. In this study, 12 nickel-based SC superalloys were designed with the aid of the d-electrons concept. Their chemical compositions were in the range of 1.2-1.5%Ti, 3.8-6.5%Cr, 11%Co, 0-1.4%Mo, 0-3.0%Ru, 6.5-7.4%Ta, 5.0-6.4%W, 3.6-5.4%Re, 5.1-5.5%Al, 0.12-0.14%Hf and balanced Ni in wt%.

Almost all the designed alloys were found to be superior in creep rupture life to a second generation superalloy currently used in the world. For hot-corrosion resistance, estimated from the burner rig tests, any of the designed alloys were comparable or even superior to a second generation superalloy. The. oxidation resistance was very different among the designed alloys, but some of them showed better resistance than the second generation superalloy. Thus the SC alloys containing about 4-5 wt%Re had about 30 degrees C or more higher temperature capability than the second generation superalloy, while exhibiting excellent hot-corrosion resistance and good oxidation resistance.

TI Microstructure evolution of vacuum plasma sprayed CoNiCrAlY coatings
   after heat treatment and isothermal oxidation
SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB The microstructure of a CoNiCrAlY coating vacuum plasma sprayed onto an aluminized MARM002 Ni-base superalloy was investigated in the as-deposited condition, after heat treatment to promote adhesion, and after oxidation in air for 100 h at 1100 degrees C. The as-sprayed coating comprised three main phases: the solid solution gamma-(Ni, Co), the intermetallic compound p-(Ni, Co)Al and the intermetallic compound gamma'-(Ni, CO)(3)Al that grew as small precipitates inside gamma grains. gamma' phase was present even in the as-sprayed condition because of Al diffusion into the coating from the aluminized substrate during manufacture at temperatures of 800-1000 degrees C. The microstructure was fine-scale and complex with beta phase within gamma grains, at gamma grain boundaries and large beta grains surrounded by gamma matrix. After heat treatment, the microstructure comprised p grains typically of 3-mu m diameter randomly distributed throughout the gamma matrix. There was little or no Al depletion of the coating because of Al diffusion from the substrate aluminized layer. Diffusion of C from the substrate induced the formation of Cr23C6 and M5Y (where M was predominantly Ni and Co) in the assprayed coating; with M5Y transforming to Y2O3 during heat treatment due to internal oxidation. After oxidation, there was a loss of Al despite the aluminized layer, because of the formation of a thermally grown oxide (TGO) layer on the upper surface of the coating, mainly comprising Al2O3 with some Cr2O3. There was a corresponding reduction in p phase fraction and a substantial reduction in the substrate aluminized layer thickness. Some grains persisted close to the TGO at grain boundaries, together with Y2O3 and Cr23C6 particles. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Structures and mechanical properties of Ni-Co-Cr based superalloy
   prepared by technique of EB-PVD
SO RARE METAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING
AB The sheet of Ni-Co-Cr based superalloy with about 0.3 mm thickness was prepared by technique of electron beam physical vapor deposition. X-ray diffraction instrument, optical microscope, scanning electronic microscope and tensile equipment were used to research the microstructures and mechanical properties of the superalloy before and after heat treatment. The results show that as-deposited alloy had microcrystallites and many defects; after heat treatment the size of crystal grain became large, the defect density was decreased rapidly, gamma' phases-the deposition strengthening phases were separated out of the crystal grains. Compared with asdeposited alloy, mechanical properties of heat-treated alloy were increased obviously. The technique of EB-PVD provides a new method for preparing superalloy sheet of excellent performance.

TI Effect of Mo content on the microstructure and stress rupture of a Ni
   base single crystal superalloy
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB Ni base single crystal superalloys of three kinds of Mo content were prepared by screw selecting method. The microstructures and stress rupture properties of the superalloys with 2%, 3% and 4% Mo were compared. The results showed that as-cast structures of the three alloys were composed of gamma and gamma' phases. After heat treatment, mu phase obviously precipitated and grew in the alloys with 4% Mo, while only a few p phase in the alloys with 3% Mo, and in 2% Mo containing alloy no mu phase precipitated after heat exposure to 1100 degrees C /500 h. The mu phase was mainly composed of Mo, Re, W, Cr, Co, Nb etc., in which for the tendency of forming mu phase Mo is the strongest, Re, W, Cr are the second place and Co, Nb are the weakest. A lot of precipitation of rod-like mu phases damaged high temperature stress rupture properties of alloys. Due to a few mu phase no effect on the stress rupture property and the solid solution strengthening of Mo, the optimum Mo content should be 3% for the based alloy Ni-5Cr-10Co-4W-3Re-5.6Al-8Ta-1Ti-0.5Nb.

TI Erosion performance of coatings produced by shrouded plasma spray
   process on a Co-based superalloy
SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB Erosion studies were carried out using an air-jet erosion test rig at a velocity of 40 m s(-1) and impingement angles of 30 degrees and 90 degrees on uncoated Co-based Superalloy (3Fe-10Ni-20Cr-1.5Mn-0.3Si-0.08C-15W-Balance Co) as well as plasma spray NiCrAlY-, Ni-20Cr- and Ni3Al-coated superalloy specimens at room temperature. Coatings were characterised before the erosion test. The eroded surfaces have been examined by SEM/EDAX and optical Profilometer. From the EPMA analysis of the as-sprayed plasma coatings the tendency for diffusion of cobalt, tungsten and iron from the substrate into the coatings has been indicated. Ni3Al coating gave the least erosion rate at a 90 degrees impact angle, whereas the NiCrAlY coating gave the lowest erosion rate at 30 degrees. The Ni-20Cr coating gave the highest erosion rate with both the impact angles. The bare cobalt-based superalloy showed better erosion resistance as compared to the plasma-sprayed coatings. The overall ductile behaviour has been revealed by the scanning electron microscope for both the bare and coated alloys. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Studies of the metallurgical and mechanical properties of high velocity
   oxy-fuel sprayed stellite-6 coatings on Ni- and Fe-based superalloys
SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB High-velocity oxygen-fuel (HVOF) process is one of the most popular thermal spraying technologies and has been widely adopted by many industries due to its flexibility and the superior quality of coatings produced. This paper demonstrates the successful application of Stellite-6 metallic coatings on the Ni- and Fe-based superalloys by HVOF process for hot corrosion applications. The microstructure, porosity, coating thickness, phase formation and microhardness properties of the coatings were characterised using the combined techniques of optical microscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive analysis (SEM/EDAX) and electron probe microanalysis (EPMA). The coatings exhibited characteristic splatlike, layered morphologies due to the deposition and re-solidification of successive molten or semi-molten powder particles. The coating possesses porosity, unmelted and semimelted particles, and inclusions. The coatings have porosity less than 2% and hardness values in the range of 800-900 Hv. The as sprayed microstructure has a face centred cubic (fec) Co-rich metallic matrix with very small fraction of CoNiO2 spinet oxide. EDAX analysis of the coating microstructure confirmed that the coating composition is similar to the feedstock powder. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Microstructure of cobalt based alloy coatings produced by laser deposit
   welding
SO SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY OF WELDING AND JOINING
AB Coatings of cobalt based alloy HMSP 2528, deposited on a nickel based superalloy using a transverse flow CO2 laser, are investigated. Sections of the coatings have been examined to reveal their microstructure and phase composition using an Olympus PME - 3 type optical microscope, scanning electron microscope, transmission electron microscope, and X-ray diffractometer. The results showed that primary phase (gamma-Co) and eutectic (gamma-Co+Cr23C6) were present in the coatings. Rapid directional solidification was found at the interface, where the growth direction was perpendicular to the interface. Multidirectional growth and growth parallel to the scanning direction were also found in the central region and near the top surface, respectively. At the remelted boundary between two tracks, a novel microstructure was found in which the crystallisation direction of the first track was transmitted to the second track. As more tracks were deposited, coarsening dendrites could be found at the interfaces.

AB Two Ni(Co)CrAlY coatings were deposited by EB-PVD method on a DS superalloy of Ni-Al-Cr-Co-W-Mo-Ta-Hf system. SEM, XEDS and XRD were used to study the oxidation behavior of the coatings. The two coatings show a good protection for the DS superalloy. The results of the isothermal oxidation test at 1 150 degrees C for 100 h show that the oxidation tendency obeys the parabolic law, and the oxidation rate constant K-p of the coated specimens decreases to about 1/3 of that for the bare superalloy. After oxidation, a continuous alumina-based scale is formed at the surfaces of the coated samples. Y2O3, NiO and SiO2 are also detectable in the oxide scale. A large number of Al in the coating is consumed due to high-temperature diffusion and oxidation reactions, and the NiAl phases in the coating are almost completely transformed to Ni3Al phases. For the Hf-bearing coating, some HfO2 particles exist at the interface between the coating and the substrate. Although internal oxidation occurs, the coating still shows a good adhesion with the superalloy substrate even after oxidation for 100 h. For the bare DS superalloy, after 100 h oxidation at 1 150 degrees C, only discontinuous alumina-based oxide particles exist on the surface. Oxide spallation occurs for the bare alloy.

TI Microstructural evolution in a Ni-Cr-Co based superalloy during cooling
   from the melt
SO MATERIALS CHARACTERIZATION
AB In this study the composition of a Ni-Cr-Co based superalloy was modified with silicon additions in order to observe its effects on the microstructure. The evolution of the microstructure was investigated by electron microscopy of as-cast samples containing various amounts of Si ranging from 0.48 to 5.43 wt.%. The precipitated phases were identified through electron diffraction to be sigma (sigma), chi (chi), and M23C6. The sigma precipitates of blocky morphology appeared to enclose the precipitates of X phase. Lamellar regions consisting of sigma and M23C6 were observed to form along the boundaries between the sigma particles and the neighboring phases. These lamellar cells were observed to have grown into the intermetallic phases sigma and chi. A crystallographic relationship was also found to exist between the sigma and M23C6.

TI Densification and microstructural evolution during co-sintering of
   Ni-base superalloy powders
SO METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND
   MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB This work presents the effect of co-sintering on the densification and microstructural evolution in the two-layer stepwise graded composite of INCONEL 718 and INCONEL 625 superalloys. A pressureless co-sintering method in conjunction with a powder layering technique was used. The sintering was carried out in solid state and liquid phase in temperature ranging from 1260 degrees C through 1300 degrees C for 60 minutes in a low pressure of an argon atmosphere. Nonisothermal sintering behavior was also examined by dilatometric analysis. Similarly, the sintering response of the individual layers was characterized. The results reveal an enhanced densification rate during co-sintering of the composite layers. Sintering at low temperatures (T < 1270 degrees C) led to formation of a narrow dense region at the interface while the sintered layers were porous. In contrast, sintering at higher temperatures resulted in significant densification of the layers, although formation of a pore band at the interface was realized. It is suggested that the strain rate incompatibility between the layers during sintering induces mismatch stresses at the interface region. The resulting strain energy influences the densification of the boundary region by exerting a pressure on the sintering neck and affecting the material flow during liquid phase sintering. The induced densification of the bilayer configuration was experimentally measured and was shown to be in good agreement with the strain rate incompatibility.

TI Silicon-boronising of Nimonic 90 superalloy
SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB In the present work, Nimonic 90 alloy surface has been modified to increase its abrasive wear resistance by using a self-protective silicon-boronising paste agent. A multilayer consisting of intermetallic compounds, or a composite layer containing different intermetallic compounds, was formed at the surface. In the former case, the multilayer coating consisted of an outer layer of (Ni,CO)(2)Si, an intermediate layer of (Cr,Co)(2)B, and an inner layer of Ti-rich nickel silicide. The total thickness of these layers was 40-90 mu m, depending on the temperature and the holding time. In the latter case, the composite layer contained lathlike (Ni,CO)(5)Si-2, 'flower patterns' of CrB and modified nickel alloy matrix. The composite layers were about 500 and 800 mu m thick after 2 h and 8 h of treatment, respectively. The microhardness of the coatings was about 3 times higher than that of the Nimonic 90 substrate. The abrasive wear resistance of Nimonic 90 was raised by 2.5-5 times, depending on the employed surface treatment parameters. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI High-temperature oxidation behavior of arc ion plated NiCoCrAlYSiB
   coatings on cobalt-based superalloy
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS RESEARCH
AB NiCoCrAlYSiB coatings were deposited on the Co-based superalloy K40 by arc ion plating (AIP). The oxidation behavior of the bare alloy and of the coated specimens was tested in static air for 200 h at 1000 degrees C and 100 h at 1050 degrees C. The results showed that the oxidation rate of the system was greatly reduced by the addition of the NiCoCrAlYSiB coatings. Thin and adherent alpha-Al2O3 scales that formed on the coated specimens protected the substrates from further oxidation attack while non-protective oxide scales, mainly of Cr2O3 and CoCr2O4, appeared on bare K40 alloy. Element profiles on metallographic cross sections indicated that apparent interdiffusion occurred between the coatings and the substrates. The interdiffusion behavior and the resulting microstructure were investigated. As compared to aluminide coatings, NiCoCrAlYSiB coatings have less influence on the substrate microstructure.

TI Prediction of thermal mechanical fatigue properties of ni-base single

SO JOURNAL OF THE JAPAN INSTITUTE OF METALS
AB This study was carried out to find out the mechanical properties of nickel-base superalloys that affect thermal mechanical fatigue (TMF). TMF tests and high temperature tensile tests were conducted on 28 of Ni-base single crystal superalloys in order to obtain mechanical property data. Based on the experimental data, Multiple regression analysis was performed for the correlation between the number of TMF cycles to failure and the alloy compositions. The multiple correlation coefficient was found to be R = 0.84; this indicates that alloy composition has a considerable relationship with the number of TMF cycles to failure. It was also found that the addition of Co, Ru and Al is effective to improve the TMF property. In addition, another multiple regression analysis was also carried out for the correlation between the number of TMF cycles to failure among high temperature mechanical properties and microstructural parameters.

TI Effect of nano-Y2O3 on microstructure of laser cladding cobalt-based

SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB Cobalt-based alloy coatings with and without nano-Y2O3 particles produced by a 5 kW CO2 laser on Ni-based superalloy were introduced. Solidified microstructure, phase compositions and distribution of nano-particles were investigated by using optical microscope, SEM, TEM and XRD. The results showed that metastable phases, such as gamma-Co and Cr23C6 existed in cobalt-based alloy coatings. Another two phases (Y2O3 and epsilon-Co) were found by adding nano-Y2O3. Without nano-Y2O3, rapid directional solidified microstructure of columnar dendrite appeared. Fine and short dendritic microstructure and columnar to equiaxed transition (CET) occurred by adding nano-Y2O3 particles. With the increase in amount of nano-Y2O3, fully equiaxed crystallization appeared and the formation mechanism was analyzed. The results also showed that the sub-microstructure of the coatings changed from dislocation to stacking fault by adding nano-Y2O3. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Pre-oxidation of Inconel alloys for inhibition of carbon deposition from

SO OXIDATION OF METALS
AB Exposure of superalloy surfaces to jet fuel at elevated temperatures leads to the formation of carbonaceous deposits and metal sulfides. The formation of stable oxide layers on alloy surfaces can reduce the activity of the constituent transition metals that catalyze the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons and the subsequent carbon deposit growth. The metals Ni, Cr, Fe, Mn, Al, Ti and Nb + Ta form thermodynamically stable oxide layers after oxidation above 800 degrees C under O-2 flow. In this study, we investigated the formation of oxides and spinels on three different Ni-base superalloys (Inconel 600, Inconel 718, and Inconel X750) and their activity towards carbon and sulfur deposit formation from jet fuel (JP-8) thermal stressing at 600 degrees C and 34 atm (500 psig) for 5 hr. Metal oxide formation during pre-oxidation and the behavior of pre-oxidized samples in thermal stressing were found to depend strongly on the minor element composition of these superalloys.

TI Determination of thallium in nickel-based superalloys by ICP-QMS after
   multi-matrix separation
SO ATOMIC SPECTROSCOPY
AB A simple and rapid method is proposed for the determination of critical thallium present at trace and ultra-trace levels in different types of Ni-based superalloys by inductively coupled plasma quadrupole mass spectrometry (ICP-QMS).
   Thallium was quantitatively separated from a multi-component superalloy (containing nearly 10 major constituents) by a solvent extraction method using 1M HBr, then extracted into diethyl ether, and measured by ICP-QMS. Significant separation of all major matrix elements (Al, Ti, V, Cr, Co, Nb, Mo, Hf, Ta, W, Ni, and Re) was achieved.
   Recovery of thallium was found to be 99%. Reasonable agreement was observed for these results with the certified values of British Chemical Standards (BCS-346 and BCS-345) and with the values obtained from the direct and matrix-separation analysis by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (GFAAS).
   Using ICP-QMS, the reproducibility of the method was 10% RSD at trace levels and 20% RSD at low parts per billion levels. The accuracy was within +/- 15% at trace levels, and the detection limits achieved were 2 ng g(-1) for thallium.

AB The oxidation behavior of Pt+Hf-modified gamma-Ni + gamma'-Ni(3)Al alloys containing up to 20 at.% Pt and either 15 or 20 at.% Al was studied by oxidizing the alloys in air at 1150 degrees C under both isothermal and thermal cycling conditions. It was found that the co-addition of Pt and Hf was extremely beneficial to oxidation resistance, to the extent that Ni-20Al-20Pt-Hf` and Ni-20Al-10Pt-Hf alloys (all compositions are in at.%) oxidized at significantly slower rates than that of a Ni-50Al-15Pt beta-NiAl alloy. A Ni-20Al-5Pt-Hf alloy also showed good oxidation resistance, with the steady-state oxidation rate being almost the same as that obtained for the beta alloy. Over a period of up to 500 one-hour oxidation cycles, no oxide spallation from the modified gamma+gamma' alloys was observed. From cross-sectional SEM examination coupled with X-ray diffraction analyses, it was found that a compact and planar exclusive scale layer of alpha-Al(2)O(3) formed on the Ni-20Al-20Pt-Hf alloy. By contrast, the Ni-20Al-10Pt-Hf and Ni-20Al-5Pt-Hf alloys formed a very thin outer layer of NiAl(2)O(4) and a planar inner layer of alpha-Al(2)O(3). The thickness of the inner Al(2)O(3) layer increased with increasing oxidation time relative to that of the NiAl(2)O(4) layer, meaning that the latter primarily formed during the initial stages of scale formation. Both NiO and NiAl(2)O(4) were found in the scales formed on the Ni-20Al-Hf and Ni-15Al-0 similar to 10Pt-Hf alloys, with the thickness of these oxide layers decreasing with increasing Pt content in the alloys. Further, it was found that the extent of internal HfO(2) formation decreased significantly with increasing Pt content, to the extent that no HfO(2) was found in the oxidized Ni-20Al-20Pt-Hf alloy. Inferences for the observed beneficial effects of Pt promoting protective Al(2)O(3) formation and decreasing the tendency for Hf to oxidize in gamma+gamma' alloys are discussed.

AB In the present study, platinum-iridium alloys (Ir = 15.8, 27.3, 36.1, 100at.%) were electroplated on a nickel-base single crystal superalloy TMS-82+ followed by a diffusion treatment at 1373K for 1 h. Interdiffusion behavior between the Pt-Ir films and substrates was investigated in terms of chemical composition, phase constitution and morphology. X-ray analysis revealed that annealed specimens consisted of several fcc solid solutioned phases with various lattice parameters, together with ordered intermetallic compounds (Ll(2)-(Pt,Ni)(3)Al and B2-(IrNi)Al), due to the inward diffusion of Pt and Ir from the electrodeposited films to the superalloy substrates, and the outward diffusion of solute elements (Ni, Al, Cr, Co) in the superalloy substrates into the films during annealing. The depth concentration analysis indicated that the Pt-36.1 Ir film effectively retarded the outward diffusion of solute elements, especially nickel, from the substrate.

TI Influence of surface treatment of bondcoat and yttrium in bondcoat on
   oxidation behavior of thermal barrier coatings
SO JOURNAL OF THE JAPAN INSTITUTE OF METALS
AB This paper focuses on the oxide layer formed at bondcoat/topcoat interface of thermal barrier coatings (TBCs), which grows faster in comparison with the oxide layer formed on overlay coatings, although both bondcoat and overlay coating are made of MCrAlY alloy (M is Ni or Co, or combination of Ni and Co). The authors clarify the influence of (D the surface treatment (shot peening) of bondcoat and (2) yttrium in bondcoat on the oxidation behavior of the thermal barrier coatings. Oxidation tests were carried out at 950 degrees C in air by means of TBC specimens. The specimen consists of Ni-base superalloy (Inconel738LC), CoNiCrAlY bondcoat and ZrO2-Y2O3 topcoat. In the TBC specimen with as-sprayed bondcoat, the oxide layer consisted of "wart-like oxide" and "continuous alumina layer". The wart-like oxide is caused due to un-melted particles of CoNiCrAlY alloy that remained at the bondcoat /topcoat interface in spraying process. The surface treatment of bondcoat prevented the formation of wart-like oxide because the unmelted particles were removed. In the TBC specimen with as-sprayed bondcoat, yttrium-rich oxide particles were included in the continuous alumina layer. The surface treatment of bondcoat and/or the removal of yttrium from the chemical composition of bondcoat in TBC specimen prevented the formation of the yttrium-rich oxide particles in the continuous oxide layer, and as a result, the growth of continuous alumina layer was decreased. There is a possibility that the application of the bondcoat without yttrium restrains the growth of the continuous oxide layer in TBC.

TI Microstructure of Al2O3 nanocrystalline/cobalt-based alloy composite
   coatings by laser deposition
SO MATERIALS & DESIGN
AB Composite coatings, made of nano-Al2O3/cobalt-based alloy, produced by a 5-kW CO2 laser on Ni-based superalloy were investigated. The coatings were examined to reveal their microstructure using optical microscope, scanning electron microscope, transmission electron microscope and X-ray diffraction instrument. The results showed that some equilibrium or non-equilibrium phases, such as gamma-Co, Cr23C6, CoAl2O4, Al2O3 and epsilon-Co existed in the coatings. Fine and short dendritic microstructure and columnar to equiaxed transition occurred by adding nano-Al2O3 particle. With the increase of nano-materials (1%, mass fraction), fully equiaxed crystallization appeared. These were contributed to that nano-Al2O3 particles acted as new nucleation site and rapid solidification of the melted pool. The results also showed inhomogeneous dispersion of nano-Al2O3 that resulted in the formation of epsilon-Co phase in the coatings. The sub-micro structure of the clad was stacking fault. The mechanism of formation of equiaxed grains was also analyzed. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Research and Improvement on structure stability and corrosion resistance
   of nickel-base superalloy INCONEL alloy 740
SO MATERIALS & DESIGN
AB INCONEL alloy 740 is a newly developed Ni-Cr-Co-Mo-Nb-Ti-Al superalloy in the application to ultra-supercritical boilers with steam temperatures up to 700 degrees C. By means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), micro-chemical phase analyses, and corrosion-resisting test, this paper investigates the structure stability of the alloy at elevated temperature and concentrates on coal ash corrosion performance of the alloy under the simulated coal ash/ flue gas condition. Experimental results show that the most important structure instabilities of the alloy during prolonged aging are gamma' coarsening, gamma' to eta transformation and G phase formation at grain boundary. The performance of corrosion resistance of the alloy would meet the requirement of ultra-supercritical boiler tubes. The phase computation by means of Thermo-Calc has been adopted in chemical composition modification for structure stability improvement. Two suggested new modified alloys in adjustment of the Al and Ti contents and in control of Si level, and also in maintenance of Cr content of the alloy were designed and melted for experimental investigation. These two modified alloys exhibit more stable microstructure during 760 degrees C long time aging. (C) 2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB A superheater tube superalloy GH2984 with excellent properties had been successfully developed, which does not contains expensive element Co but has 32%-36% Fe, so it has low cost. In this paper, the characteristics of GH2984, including the chemical composition, mechanical and chemical properties, the microstructure stability after long-time thermal exposure and the processing property at hot and cold conditions have been introduced briefly. Then the superiority of this alloy used in ship boiler and ultra-supercritical coal-fired boiler as superheater was analyzed. The results from practical application to the ship boilers show that the GH2984 superalloy is suitable to the ship boiler superheater tube material, and the alloy also is very important candidate of a superheater and reheater materials in the ultra-supercritical steam boilers.

   MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB We proposed a new method for developing Ni-base turbine disc alloy for application at temperatures above 700 degrees C by mixing a Ni-base superalloy U720LI with a two-phase alloy Co-16.9 wt pet Ti in various contents. The microstructure and phase stability of the alloys were analyzed using an optical microscope, a scanning electron microscope, energy-dispersive spectroscopy, and an X-ray diffractometer. The yield strength was studied by compression tests at temperatures ranging from 25 degrees C to 1200 degrees C. The results show that all the alloys had a dendritic structure. Ni3Ti (eta) phase was formed in the interdendritic region in the alloys with the addition of Co-16.9 wt pet Ti, and its volume fraction increased with the increase in the addition of Co-16.9 wt pet Ti. The results of exposure at 750 degrees C show that the addition of Co-16.9 wt pet Ti to U720LI had a great effect on suppressing the formation of a phase due to the reduced Cr content in the gamma matrix. Compared to U720LI, the alloys with the addition of Co-16.9 wt pet Ti possessed higher yield strength. The solid-solution strengthening of gamma and gamma' and higher volume fraction of gamma' were assumed to cause this strength increase.

TI Creep strength of Co-free Ni-base single crystal superalloys
SO JOURNAL OF THE JAPAN INSTITUTE OF METALS
AB The Pebble Bed Modular Reactor (PBMR) is a small atomic power reactor which can be used in areas where the electric power transmission network is not well developed. It generates electricity by gas-turbines that used He-gas as a coolant. Ni-based superalloys are the primary materials used in gas-turbines. However if conventional Ni-base superalloys are to be used for PBMR, turbine maintenances will be difficult due to Co, as it can produce Co-60 a recitative material that possesses a long half-life. Therefore, Co-free Ni-base superalloys are required for PBMR.
   In this paper, a Co-free single-crystal (SC) superalloy, TMS-82 + (-Co), was developed; it was the same chemical composition as the 2(nd) generation SC superalloy, TMS-82+, except that it is Co-free creep tests were performed on the developed alloy, TMS-82 +, under three conditions; 900 degrees C/392 MPa, 1000 degrees C/245 MPa, and 1100 degrees C/137 MPa; CMSX-4, a popular SC alloy, was used as comparison.
   TMS-82 + (-Co) displayed superior creep-rupture life in all creep tests; however, detrimental TCP were observed in the microstructure of the sample that underwent creep testing at 1100 degrees C/137 MPa. This, the developed Co-free SC alloy should be further modified for long-term microstructural stability. Elimination of phase formation will allow the alloy to be utilized in the PBMR.

TI A technique for characterizing microsegregation in multicomponent alloys
   and its application to single-crystal superalloy castings
SO METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND
   MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Instrumental errors in microsegregation measurements in multicomponent alloys complicate the treatment of randomly sampled data. In this article, two new alloy-independent data treatment algorithms are presented that are capable of separating the effects of scatter in the data from the underlying segregation trends, assigning each measurement location a unique fraction solid. These new methods are physically reasonable and result in improved estimates of segregation parameters, particularly the solute partitioning at the dendrite tip. This is demonstrated by determining the microsegregation in four successive generations of single-crystal (SX) nickel-based superalloys. Artificial, noise-induced, tails commonly seen in the microsegregation profiles are also minimized. A methodology for evaluating sorting schemes is introduced that does not depend upon a priori knowledge of the partitioning direction. Comparison is made to both other sorting methods and CALPHAD predicted partition coefficients. Implications for alloy design are reported, illustrating the interaction between solute species such as Ru, Re, Co, and W.

AB The hot-section components in commercial aerogas turbines were typically made of nickel-based superalloys and were protected by coatings. Two kinds of diffusion aluminide coatings, including simple aluminide coating and NiCr-CrAl coating, were prepared on a nickel-based cast superalloy by LP-VCD and pack cementation techniques, respectively. The isothermal oxidation behavior of the cast alloy and the coatings at 1000 and 1100 degrees C and their hot corrosion behaviors in the presence of 75 wt.% Na2SO4+K2SO4 film at 900 degrees C were studied using TGA, scanning electron microscopy (SEM)/energy-dispersive spectrometry (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and electron probe microanalysis (EPMA), respectively. The results showed that NiCr-CrAl coating, not only held a very excellent oxidation resistance due to the alpha-Al2O3 formation on the coating surface during the isothermal process at 1000 and 1100 degrees C, but also possessed excellent hot corrosion resistance in sulphate melt. Internal oxidation and nitridation were found in the cast alloy during the oxidation process. Moreover, the cast alloy suffered from catastrophic hot corrosion, resulting in the serious internal oxidation and sulfidation. The oxidation resistance of the simple aluminide coating was superior to the cast alloy; the simple aluminide coating was damaged completely and lost its protective effect after the hot corrosion test. In addition, the mechanisms for oxidation and corrosion of the cast alloy and the coatings are discussed simultaneously. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Metals and their alloys, except for a few intermetallics, are inherently ductile, i.e., plastic deformation precedes fracture in these materials. Therefore, resistance to fracture is directly related to the development of the plastic zone at the crack tip. Recent studies indicate that the fracture toughness of single crystals depends on the crystallographic orientation of the notch as well as the loading direction. In general, the dependence of crack propagation resistance on crystallographic orientation arises from the anisotropy of (i) elastic constants, (ii) plastic deformation (or slip), and (iii) the weakest fracture planes (e.g., cleavage planes). Because of the triaxial stress state at the notch tips, many slip systems that otherwise would not be activated during uniaxial testing become operational. The plastic zone formation in single crystals has been tackled theoretically by Rice and his co-workers [Rice, J. R., 1987, Mech. Mater 6, pp. 317-335; Rice, J. R., and Saeedvafa, M., 1987, J. Mech. Phys. Solids 36, pp. 189-214; Saeedvafa, M., and Rice, J. R., 1988; ibid., 37, pp. 673-691; Rice, J. R., Hawk, D. E., Asaro, R. J., 1990, Int. J. Fract. 42, pp. 301-321; Saeedvafa, M., and Rice, J. R., 1992, Modell. Simul. Mater Sci. Eng. 1, pp. 53-71] and only limited experimental work has been conducted in this area. The study of the stresses and strains in the vicinity of a fcc single-crystal notch tip is of relatively recent origin. We present experimental and numerical investigation of three-dimensional (3D) stress fields and evolution of slip sector boundaries near notches in fcc single-crystal PWA1480 tension test specimens and demonstrate that a 3D linear elastic finite element model, which includes the effect of material anisotropy, is shown to predict active slip planes and sectors accurately. The slip sector boundaries are shown to have complex curved shapes with several slip systems active simultaneously near the notch. Results are presented for surface and mid-plane of the specimens. The results demonstrate that accounting for 3D elastic anisotropy is very important for accurate prediction of slip activation near fcc single-crystal notches loaded in tension. Results from the study will help establish guidelines for fatigue damage near single-crystal notches.

A temperature interval from the liquidus temperature to 800 K is covered, including solid state transformations. This paper discusses several results: fraction solid compared to results from Scheil and equilibrium calculations, microsegregation profiles for Al, Co, Cr, Re, Ta, Ti and W compared to experimental values, and the formation of finely dispersed gamma'-phase in the solid state. The relatively simple one-dimensional diffusion simulation is shown to be a valuable tool to investigate phase formation and microsegregation during solidification and cooling. In the case of CMSX-4 it represents a significant improvement over the commonly used Scheil calculations for the prediction of the fraction solid. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   equilibrium in superalloys
SO CANADIAN METALLURGICAL QUARTERLY
AB A thermodynamic model has been developed to address the gamma, gamma prime and liquid phase equilibrium for dilute single crystal gas turbine alloys such as CMSX-10. The model is based on a review of the Ni-X (X = Al, Co, Cr, Re, Ta, W) binary systems where the observed binary phase diagrams are well reproduced with self-consistent thermodynamic models that incorporate, when available, measured thermodynamic properties. These models are then interpolated using the Kohler scheme to address the gamma-gamma prime equilibrium observed in the related Al-Ni-X ternary systems. The gamma and liquid phases are modelled using a substitutional solution formalism; the gamma prime phase is modelled as the stoichiometric compound Ni3Al into which are dissolved compounds of the Ni3X type. The role of coherency in superalloy microstructure and the importance of a sound knowledge of constituent binary systems are discussed. The calculated phase equilibrium compositions and phase transformation temperatures are compared to the literature data for CMSX-10.

At low temperatures, predominantly slip band crack growth (which remained effectively in-plane) was observed, although the scale of the facets increased under mixed mode loading. At high temperatures mixed mode loading resulted in deflected co-operative slip crack growth along a direction that experienced the maximum opening mode (analogous to Stage II crack growth). Some pore cavitation and interlinking was observed at the highest temperatures and lowest frequencies. The effect of increased dwell time at 850 degrees C was to increase crack growth rates compared with the highest frequency test, although differences in the magnitude of these effects were seen for the two different loading conditions. The increased constraint experienced by the deflected crack offers a partial explanation for this. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB NiCoCrAlY + (6-8 wt%)Y2O3 stabilized ZrO2(YSZ) two-layer thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) were deposited by electron beam physical vapor deposition on Ni3Al or Ni-base superalloy and their high temperature fatigue behavior was investigated experimentally and computationally. It has been found that the pre-treatment of the bond coat has greatly improved the thermal cyclic lifetime of TBCs with respect to those without pre-treatment. The lifetime is limited by the existence of interface between bond coat and top coat, and smoothing the interface can also improve the thermal cyclic lifetime. When the roughness of the interface changed from 3.76 to 0.82 mu m, testing lifetime increased from about 500 (1000 cycles) to 700 h (1400 cycles), and the adhesive strength of the interface increased from 3.5 to 4.7 MPa m(1/2) estimated from the result of surface Rock-well hardness testing. Cracks occurred in the thermally grown oxide (TGO) layer are considered to be the main reason for the failure of two-layer TBCs. It has been found that with pre-oxide layer thickness increasing from 1.0 to 3.0 mu m, the Growth rate of TGO increased during thermal cyclic testing and the thermal cyclic lifetime of TBCs decreased from 730 to 450 h. The lower lifetime was caused by the co-action of larger internal stress resulted from thicker TGO layer and the fatigue of the TGO layer. Finite element method (FEM) analysis showed that large tensile stress was introduced at the beginning of rapid cooling process, resulting in the spallation of top coat from bond coat. Ab initio calculation was carried Out to evaluate the binding energy of the interface of bond coat and ceramic top coat. and FEM models were used to investigate stress and strain states in TBCs during thermal shock process as a function of cooling rate. The results showed that ZrO2/Ni interface exhibits nonmetallic properties, and that the chemical bonding in ZrO2/Ni is covalent-ionic in nature. The calculation of binding energies between both Ni and O and Zr and O indicates that the binding energy of Ni and O is larger than that of Zr and O, which is helpful to investigate the failure mechanism of thermal barrier coatings.

TI Oxidation behaviors of new Ni-based superalloy at 950 degrees C and 1000
   degrees C
SO RARE METAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING
AB A new nickel-based superalloy was oxidized in air at 950degreesC and 1000degreesC for time up to 140 h. Its oxidation behaviors were investigated by means of TGA, XRD and SEM(EDX). The kinetic curve of alloy oxidized at 950degreesC for 128 h obeys the parabolic rate law and no oxide peels off. The parabolic law is almost followed when alloy is oxidized at 1 000degreesC. A small amount of oxide scale spallation happens in the course of oxidation at 1 000degreesC. The oxide scales consist of Cr2O3,(Ni,Co)Cr2O4, TiO2, SiO2 and Al2O3, and internal oxidation takes place both at 950degreesC and at 1 000degreesC. This new alloy exhibits higher resistance to oxidation at 950degreesC than that at 1 000degreesC. The oxidation mechanism of the alloy has also been suggested by the phase composition analyses of oxide layers.

AB Co-base superalloys have been applied in the stationary compoents of gas turbine owing to their excellent high temperaure properties. The stationary Co-base alloy components are generally manufactured by casting. Solidification behavior of the alloy is an important factor in the selection of casting parameters. In the present study, solidification microstructure and carbide formation behaviors were studied by directional solidification. Directional solidification experiments were carried out at the solidification rates of 0.5 similar to 150 mu m/s with the Co-base superalloy ECY768. Between the dendrites just below the final freezing temperature, MC carbide and M23C6 carbide were found. It was identified that the script or blocky carbides were Ta or W-rich MC carbide, and the lamellar carbides were Cr-rich M23C6 eutectic carbides. The solid/liquid interface morphology clearly showed that freezing of the Cr-rich eutectic carbide occurred just after the script type MC carbide.

SO JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Oxide scale formations in CH4-H2O atmospheres were compared for different alloys as interconnects in solid oxide fuel cells (Fe-Cr and Ni-Cr alloys). Oxidation with anode gases (CH4, H2O, CO, and CO2) caused a relatively thick oxide scale formation on the alloy surfaces even in the low oxygen partial pressures at 1073 K. The distribution of elements in the oxide scale and the growth rates of oxide scales were precisely analyzed among the examined alloys by glow discharge optical emission spectrometry. Mn spinels formed on the top surface of oxide scales for both Fe-Cr and Ni-Cr alloys. Oxide scale thickness grew with annealing time by a parabolic relationship, and the growth rates were in the orders of 10(-6)-10(-5) mu m(2) s(-1) at 1073 K. Ni-Cr alloy shows relatively low growth rate compared with the Fe-Cr alloy. The electrical conductivity after forming oxide scales was different depending on the oxide scale phases and thickness, which was on the order of 10-100 S cm(-1) at 1073 K.

TI Change in microstructure of plasma sprayed thermal barrier coating by
   high temperature isothermal heat exposure
SO JOURNAL OF THE JAPAN INSTITUTE OF METALS
AB The change of microstructure in an atmospheric plasma sprayed thermal barrier coating (APS-TBC) by isothermal heat exposure has been studied. Used 8 mass% Y2O2-ZrO2 TBC layer, a Ni-Co-Cr-Al-Y bond coat (BC) layer, and an IN738 superalloy substrate. The TBC system is subjected to heat exposure at 1423 K in ambient air for 10, 50, 100, 200, 300, and 400 h. Polished transverse sections of heat-exposed TBCs are examined and the changes of constitutes are discussed. Both sintering and cracking of the TBC layer are observed and these behaviors are strongly correlated with the morphology of as-sprayed intersplat boundaries and heat exposure time, respectively. A thermally grown oxide (TGO) layer is formed after heat exposure, and the thickness increases with the increase in heat exposure time. The chemical composition and morphology of the TGO layer depend on the heat exposure time. Micro-cracking in the TGO layer and TBC layer is observed after formation of a spinel, which is attributed to a lack of Al in the BC layer. The composition and phases in the BC layer are strongly correlated with the growth behavior of the TGO layer.

The structure stability of the alloy was studied in detail in combination of SEM, TEM, XRD and micro-chemical phase analyses. Experimental results show that the most important structure instability is as follows: 1) gamma' coarsening; 2) gamma' to eta transformation; 3) G phase formation. The phase computation by means of Thermo-Calc has been adopted in chemical composition modification for structure stability improvement. Two suggested new modified alloys in adjustment of the Al and Ti contents and in control of Si level were designed and melted for experimental study. These 2 modified new alloys exhibit more stable structure at 760 degrees C long time aging. A bright perspective has been shown for the development of this new alloy in the near future.

AB The precipitation behavior during ageing treatment of a single crystal nickel-base superalloy was investigated by SEM and TEM. The results showed that tetragonal needle-like G phase and blocky alpha-W phase precipitated during low temperature ageing treatment after this testing alloy was completely solution heat treated. sigma and alpha-W phases robbed of solid solution strengthening alloying element W Mo in the matrix and degraded high temperature creep rupture property severely. The creep curve of the crystal tested at 1010 degrees C and 248 MPa exhibited that the steady state creep rate epsilon was as high as 9.46 x 10(-3)/h. The creep-rupture life was only 25 hours. alpha-W phase was not formed by decrease of W content properly. A relatively low level of Co could inhibit sigma phase precipitation and improve microstructural stability.

AB At high operating temperatures the oxidation resistant MCrAlY (M=Ni, Co) coatings and the substrate alloys are highly susceptible to phase changes, particularly, after long hours of exposure, With the advent of computational modelling involving metallurgical thermodynamics and diffusion parameters in recent times, it is now possible to follow these phase changes and interdiffusion processes through simulation. In the present work, phase changes in the temperature range between 950 and 1050 degreesC in the MCrAlY coating materials containing additions of Cobalt and Rhenium have been determined through Such an approach. Further, using a diffusion simulation software interdiffusion between a commercial NiCoCrAlY coating and a Nickel-base superalloy substrate material at 1000 degreesC has been simulated. The simulated results have been compared with the experimental findings and they are found to be in reasonable agreement with each other. Some deviations observed are discussed in the light of limited availability of thermodynamic and kinetic data.

AB While the use of ORNL developed high-thermal-conductivity graphitic foam materials has been focused on thermal management applications, recent experiments have revealed their potential as bearing surfaces as well. The three primary tribological advantages are: ( 1) they can efficiently remove frictional heat, ( 2) their natural porosity can trap wear debris, and ( 3) their porosity can serve as a lubricant reservoir for the contact surface. A series of pin-on-disk experiments were conducted at both room temperature and 400 degreesC to compare the sliding friction and wear characteristics of the densified graphitic foam ( mated against M-50 tool steel or against alumina) to those of conventional bearing materials like graphite, bearing bronze, polytetrafluoroethylene, bearing steel, and a Co-based superalloy. At room temperature and under low contact pressure, the tribological behavior of the densified graphitic foam material was comparable to that of graphite and better than that of other bearing materials. At 400 degreesC, traditional graphite exhibited a "dusting'' wear regime accompanied by a high friction coefficient. In contrast, the graphitic foam demonstrated an ability to maintain low friction and wear at that temperature.

SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB Microstructural changes in a metallic oxidation protection coating (Ni-Co-Cr-Al-Y) applied on a nickel base superalloy were investigated by means of scanning and transmission electron microscopy. The changes are due either to thermal mechanical fatigue testing under high thermal gradients or to defined isothermal heat treatments. The coated specimens were quenched from temperatures between 840 and 1100degreesC to ambient temperature. The resultant phases, their local distribution and compositions were determined by energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy and electron diffraction. Phase equilibria at respective temperatures were determined by thermodynamic calculations based on the CALPHAD method. The calculated and experimentally determined phase distributions were compared. A particular microstructural feature, namely the existence and spatial distribution of spherical gamma' Ni3Al precipitates in the coating and the diffusion zone between substrate and coating, was used as a postmortem indicator for the maximum temperature experienced by the specimen during testing. This paper gives a road map for developing a microstructural-based temperature calibration for complex metallic materials using thermodynamic simulations. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SO JOURNAL OF RARE EARTHS
AB Composite coatings made of nano-Y2O3/cobalt-based alloy and produced by crosscurrent CO2 laser on Ni-based superalloy are introduced. Cross-section or surface of the coatings was examined to reveal their microstructure using optical microscope, SEM, including EDS microanalysis, TEM and XRD. The results show that some equilibrium or non-equilibrium phases, such as gamma-Co, Cr23C6, Y2O3 and epsilon-Co exist in the coatings. Fine and short dendritic microstructure and columnar to equiaxed transition (CET) occurred by adding nano-Y2O3 particles. With the increasing amount of nano-Y2O3 (1%, mass fraction), fully equiaxed crystallization appeared. These are caused by nano-Y2O3 particles acting as new nucleation site and rapid solidification of the melt. The results also show that inhomogeneous dispersion of nano-Y2O3 results in the formation of epsilon-Co phase in the coatings. The sub-microstructure of the clad is stacking fault. The mechanism of the formation of equiaxed grains is also analyzed.

The kinetic curves of the alloy oxidized at 950 degreesC without Na2SO4 deposit and at 850 degreesC with Na2SO4 deposit obeyed the parabolic law, whereas, the uniform parabolic growth behavior of oxide was not followed at 1000 degreesC without Na2SO4 deposit and at 950 degreesC with Na2SO4 deposit due to oxide spallation at 1000 degreesC and the evaporation of Na2CrO4 melt at 950 degreesC, respectively. The oxide scales consisted of Cr2O3, (Ni,Co)Cr2O4, TiO2, Al2O3 and internal oxides at all temperatures. The internal sulfidation took place due to the existence of Na2SO4 deposit. The complex layered structure of oxide scales was in favor of the resistance to oxidation. The deposition of Na2SO4 accelerated the oxidation of the alloy and the degradation of corrosion resistance of alloy with Na2SO4 deposit was attributed to the dissolution of Cr2O3 induced by basic fluxing in molten Na2SO4.

CT International Symposium on Intermetallic and Advanced Materials
CY MAR 02-06, 2003
CL San Diego, CA
AB This paper investigates the role of varying refractory addition levels on the microsegregation behaviour of single crystal (SX) superalloys systems during solidification. Specifically, a series of six Ni-base alloy compositions are set in a controlled manner, such that the chemical effects of Re, W, and Ru can be independently assessed. Each experimental alloy is produced in the SX condition utilizing a modified Bridgman casting process, with subsequent compositional analysis of the solidification structures via standard electron microprobe analysis (EPMA) methods. Qualitative partitioning results indicate typical SX alloy segregation behavior with elements such as Cr, Co, Re, Mo, and W all segregating towards the dendrite core regions, while the gamma' forming elements of Al, Ti, and Ta show favorable partitioning to the interdendritic gamma-gamma' eutectic regions. Both Ni and Ru exhibit ideal segregation behaviour with no favorable partitioning to either phase. Quantitative EPMA results indicate that as the nominal Re level increases, the severity of microsegregation to the dendrite core regions rises dramatically for Mo, Cr, and Re. Remarkably, evidence is presented demonstrating the role that Ru plays in counteracting the microsegregation effects of both increased Re and higher overall total refractory levels.

SO TETSU TO HAGANE-JOURNAL OF THE IRON AND STEEL INSTITUTE OF JAPAN
AB In advanced industrial gas-turbine systems, there has been a great demand for new single crystal (SC) superalloys with an excellent combination of high-temperature creep strength, hot-corrosion resistance and oxidation resistance. In this study, ten nickel-based SC superalloys were designed with the aid of the d-electrons concept. Their chemical compositions were in the range of 1.2-1.5% Ti, 3.8-6.5% Cr, 11% Co, 01.4% Mo, 6.5-7.4% Ta, 5.0-6.0% W, 3.6-5.4% Re, 5.1-5.5% Al, 0.12-0.14% Hf and balanced Ni in mass% units. A series of experiments such as creep rupture tests, burner rig tests and cyclic oxidation tests was conducted with the heat-treated SC specimens of these alloys. All the designed alloys were found to be superior in the creep rupture life to a second generation superalloy, CMSX-4. In the hot-corrosion resistance estimated from the burner rig tests, any designed alloys were comparable or even superior to CMSX-4. The oxidation resistance was very different amount the designed alloys, but some of them showed higher resistance than CMSX-4. Thus the SC alloys containing about 4-5 mass% Re had about 20 K higher temperature capability than CMSX-4, while exhibiting excellent hot-corrosion resistance and oxidation resistance.

TI Reactions of Co based and Fe based superalloys with a molten Zn-Al alloy
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Static corrosion tests of Co based and Fe based superalloys were carried out at 470degreesC in a molten Zn galvanising alloy containing about 0(.)22 wt.-%Al and saturated with Fe for various lengths of time up to 168 h (one-week). The superalloys readily reacted with the galvanising alloy and CoAl or Fe2Al5 formed initially on the sample surfaces. The reaction front moved towards the depth of the test pieces with increasing dipping time, leaving behind a Zn rich reaction zone. At the same time, other intermetallic phases formed in the Zn rich zone and on the surfaces of the samples. These intermetallic phases are complex in nature and vary with the alloys. In Stellite 6, Fe aluminide was prominently present in the vicinity of surviving carbide particles in the Zn rich zone of the sample tested for 168 h. Some areas of iron aluminide were intimately connected to Fe2Al5 particles building up on the sample surface. This observation suggests that the iron aluminide formed in the reaction zone provided ideal sites for the attachment of Fe2Al5 particles pre-existing in the melt onto the sample surfaces. It also served as nucleation and growth sites for the (FeAl5)-Al-2 compound on the sample surface. This is one possible mechanism of dross buildup on submerged hardware made of this type of Co based superalloy in continuous galvanising.

TI Microstructure and wear resistance of laser clad cobalt-based alloy
   multi-layer coatings
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB Multi-layer Co-based alloy (HMSP 2537) were deposited on Ni-based superalloy plate with a TJ-TL-T5000 type CO2 laser. Sections of such coatings were examined to reveal their microstructure and phase composition using optical microscope, scanning electron microscope (SEM), and X-ray diffractometer (XRD). The hardness and wear resistance of the coatings were tested. The results showed that the prime phase (gamma-Co dendrite) and other phases, such as CrNi, Co7W6, and Cr23C6 existed in the coatings. Dendrite or cellular microstructures were observed perpendicular to the interface, and coarsening microstructures were obtained as more layers deposited. Dendrite paralleling to laser scan speed was also found near the top surface of the last layer. Fine microstructures of gamma-Co dendrite and lamellar eutectic in inter-dendritic regions strengthened the coatings. Microhardness and wear resistance of the coatings were much higher than that of substrate but slightly decreased with layers increased. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SO JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES

CL London, ENGLAND
AB Oxide scale formations in anode gas atmospheres were investigated for three different Fe-Cr alloys as interconnects in solid oxide fuel cells (ZMG232, SUS430, and Fe-Cr-W). Oxidation with anode gases (CH4, H2O, CO, and CO2) caused a relatively thick oxide scale formation on the alloy surfaces even in low oxygen partial pressures at 1073 K. The distribution of elements in the oxide scale and the growth rates of oxide scales were compared among the examined alloys by glow discharge optical emission spectrometry (GDOES). Mn-Fe-Cr spinels and Cr2O3 were formed on ZMG232 and SUS430 surfaces, whereas only Cr2O3 formation was observed on Fe-Cr-W surface. Oxide scale thickness grew with annealing time by a parabolic relationship, and the growth rates were in the orders of 10(-6) to 10(-5)mum(2) s(-1) at 1073 K. The electrical conductivity after forming oxide scales was different depending on the oxide scale phases and thickness. The conductivity was in the order of 10S cm(-2) at 973 K for ZMG232 alloy.

TI Study on composition-induced microstructural variation in the interface
   between co-based hardfacing alloys and IN738Ni-based superalloy
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING AND PERFORMANCE
AB Alloy mixtures with varying composition of two Co-based hardfacing alloys and IN738 Ni-based super alloy were examined using differential scanning calorimetry. The microstructure of the resulting specimens was then analyzed using optical and scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy. The microstructural evolution between each bardfacing alloy and the IN738 substrate was documented and the formation of topologically close-packed and/or additional carbide phases was noted. Microstructures that are undesirable for high temperature and stress applications were produced in specimens with a higher degree of mixing (from 25 to 75 wt.% of hardfacing alloy in IN738). The two hardfacing alloys produced markedly different microstructures in the alloy mixtures due to differences in elemental composition. A hardfacing process that minimizes the degree of deposit-substrate mixing will be beneficial to the performance of the coating.

AB The phases formed at the interface between an intermetallic (NiAl) and a nickel base superalloy joined by combustion synthesis were investigated, particularly the eutectic phases. Owing to their small size, the characterisation of these phases using a Castaing's electron microprobe encounters difficulties. The analysis volume size is generally too large to differentiate the phases from their surrounding matrix, even by using low accelerating voltage. Moreover, the eutectic phases contain boron, which is difficult to characterise by EPMA. Independently of the phases shape, the characterisation can be solved by viewing this complex system as a surrounding matrix and a multi layer system. The results of these simulations revealed the presence of two categories of borides: the eutectic boride MM'B-2(2) (M = Mo and M' = Co, Cr) and the solid solution boride [Cr1-x (Mo, W)(x)]B.

AB A low pressure plasma sprayed (LPPS) NiCoCrAlY aircraft turbine blade overlay coating was investigated by differential thermal analysis (DTA). A pronounced irreversible endothermic reaction peak was observed at 975 degreesC for the as-sprayed coating. No equivalent reaction is observed for the LPPS coating in the annealed state and in Ni-Co-Cr-Al (Ni:Co = 2:1) compositions after slow furnace cool-down as well. The reaction scheme for the partial ternary AlNi-Cr-Ni system was taken as a reference standard for understanding the irreversible reaction, and was reexamined where necessary. The four-phase solid state reaction in the ternary system at 995 degreesC, according to gamma-Ni + beta-NiAl --> gamma'-Ni3Al + alpha-Cr, is compared with the occurrence of the reaction observed at 975 degreesC on the as-sprayed NiCoCrAlY coating material. It runs most likely according to gamma-Ni + -gamma'-Ni(3)AI --> alpha-Cr + beta-NiAl. The reaction at 975 degreesC is discussed in terms of metastable phase formation sequences.

TI Formation of primary M6C carbide and its effect on cast die superalloys
   with high content of tungsten
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB Nickel based superalloys with high content of tungsten (W) have been applied to cast the large size die. Because the formation of large amount of primary M6C phase embrittles the die, it is necessary to explore the forming condition of primary M6C. The experiments prove that the alloys containing carbon content higher than 0.15% (mass fraction) tend to precipitate primary M6C carbide and 10% Co can restrict the formation of M6C effectively. The primary M6C forms at 1375 V. The cooling rate between the solid and liquid temperature range can influence the precipitation of this phase sensitively. Rapid cooling retard the formation of M6C obviously. The section size effect of the formation of M6C exists in castings. For a heavy section possessing dendrite spacing higher than 150 mum, it is very easy to form M6C with a millimeter magnitude, which damages the high temperature strength of alloys. To prevent the precipitation of M6C in large size section die, the composition of alloy is recommended to maintain at the level of 0.04%-0.07% C and 10%-15% Co.

AB A multicomponent diffusion mobility database for the Ni-rich fcc phase [2002Cam] is evaluated by comparing diffusion simulation to two experimental multicomponent Ni-base superalloy diffusion couples: Ni/Rene-88 and IN718/Rene-88. The diffusion simulations use composition-dependent thermodynamic and diffusion quantities within a finite difference code to simulate single-phase and multiphase planar layers. The multiphase layers consist of a matrix phase and a disperse phase. The calculated composition profiles, interdiffusion coefficients, phase fraction profiles, and location of Kirkendall porosity are compared with experimental results. To treat diffusion in the IN718 alloy, iron and carbon are added to the existing diffusion mobility database using previous assessment work and new assessments of Fe-Al and Fe-Co.

Indeed the cathodic reaction (Mo(VI)lozenge Mo-III) generates O2- ions which can promote the basic dissolution of Cr2O3. c) The corrosion of a Co-base superalloy in molten C-glass is investigated as a function of temperature, yielding to the demonstration of the existence of a maximum using temperature, characterized by a passive-to-active state transition.

TI Comparison of thermal expansion and oxidation behavior of various
   high-temperature coating materials and superalloys
SO MATERIALS AT HIGH TEMPERATURES
AB The thermal expansion mismatch between a metallic substrate and its external oxide scale generates a strain on cooling that is a primary cause of spallation of protective oxide scales. This study compares thermal expansion behavior and cyclic oxidation performance of the two major composition classes of high-temperature commercial coatings for protection of single-crystal superalloys. The thermal expansion of cast MCrAlY (M = Ni and/or Co) alloys and cast aluminides (NiAl, (Ni,Pt)Al and Ni(3)Al) was measured at temperatures up to 1300degreesC and compared to that of a single-crystal Ni-base superalloy. The tendency for scale spallation from each alloy was evaluated by cyclic oxidation testing at 1150degreesC. The coefficients of thermal expansion for the aluminides were lower than those of the MCrAlY-based alloys at all temperatures and scale adherence to the Hf-doped aluminides was generally superior. Scale adherence to the various compositions of MCrAlY-type alloys did not directly correlate to their thermal expansion behavior or substrate strength. For both types of materials, the presence of a reactive element (Y,Hf, etc.) had no detectable effect on thermal expansion but a major effect on scale adherence. There was no obvious influence of At content on the thermal expansion of beta phase Ni-Al compositions. The addition of Pt resulted in a lower average thermal expansion for hyperstoichiometric (Ni,Pt)AI at temperatures above 930degreesC, but this effect was not observed in hypostoichiometric (Ni,Pt)AI.

SO METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND
   MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB The Ni-Fe based superalloy INCONEL 706 (IN706) has a complex microstructure and many A(3)B type phases, e.g., Ni3Al gamma', Ni3Nb gamma', Ni3Nb delta, or Ni3Ti eta precipitates can form. The various precipitates can also have different morphologies, i.e., plate, needle, cube, or disc shape, and some of them exist as co-precipitates-gamma'/gamma''. In the present study, in-situ measurements by small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) were performed to monitor the microstructural evolution at elevated temperatures. The SANS measurements were complemented by microstructural observations at room temperature by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM). It is demonstrated that eta plates and gamma'' needles form directly at high temperatures. Cooling from high temperature produces fine dispersions of gamma'/gamma'' precipitates, which coarsen on reheating to lower stabilization temperatures (893 and 993 K). The final morphology of the gamma'/gamma'' co-precipitates, i.e., compact/noncompact type very much depends on the stabilization temperature and the cooling rates from prior higher-temperature stabilization steps.

TI Selection and evaluation of heat-resistant alloys for SOFC interconnect
   applications
SO JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Over the past several years, advances in the design and fabrication of planar solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) have led to a steady reduction in the temperatures necessary for their operation. Consequently, it appears more realistic now to use low cost heat-resistant alloys for interconnect components in the SOFC stack. However, no specific criteria or inclusive study are available as a reference to help select and evaluate suitable candidates from the hundreds of available heat-resistant alloy compositions, which overall demonstrate oxidation resistance at high temperatures. In this work, composition criteria have been proposed for the preselection of heat-resistant compositions, such as Ni-, Fe-, and Co-based superalloys, Cr-based alloys, and stainless steels. The proposed criteria have been employed to establish a database of heat-resistant alloys at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, where a systematic approach has been initiated to evaluate and modify and/or develop alloys for SOFC interconnect applications. The preselected compositions are further evaluated by referring in-house studies and reference to published data. It appears that it would be difficult for traditional alloys to fully satisfy the materials requirements for long-term operation at temperatures higher than 700degreesC. However, the applicability can be improved via surface/bulk modification and by the implementation of novel stack designs. (C) 2003 The Electrochemical Society.

TI Oxidation behavior of a Single-crystal Ni-base superalloy in air. I: At

SO OXIDATION OF METALS
AB The oxidation behavior of a Single-crystal Ni-base superalloy was studied using discontinuous thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and prolonged exposure in air at 800 and 900degreesC. The mass gain of specimens at 900degreesC was found to be lower than that of specimens at 800degreesC because of the formation of a protective inner alpha-Al2O3 layer at 900degreesC. A subparabolic time dependence ( n = 0.16 at 800degreesC and n = 0.10 at 900degreesC) of the oxide growth rate was determined at both temperatures. At 800degreesC, the superalloy exhibited non-uniform oxidation-in some areas a thin scale with an outer NiO layer and an inner layer of an Al-rich oxide was found and, in other areas, complex oxides [CrTaO4, NiCr2O4, (Ni, Co) Al2O4, etc.] below the NiO outer layer formed by growing into the superalloy. The scale formed at 900degreesC is more uniform than that formed at 800degreesC, consisting of several layers: an NiO outer layer, spinel-rich sublayer, a CrTaO4-rich layer, and an alpha-Al2O3 inner layer. The alpha-Al2O3 inner layer provides good oxidation protection and the specimen mass gain is low for test up to 1925 hr.

TI Fracture properties of multiphase alloy MP35N
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB This paper addresses the fracture properties of commercially cold-drawn (53%) MP35N (35% Co, 35% Ni, 20% Cr, and 10% Mo) in both the cold-worked and the cold-worked and aged conditions. MP35N is a superalloy that exhibits a remarkable combination of high strength (about 2 GPa) and high fracture toughness (about 100 MParootm). The fracture toughness of MP35N was investigated systematically, with particular attention to the influence of the post deformation aging heat treatment, the sample thickness, the orientation of crack plane and the direction of crack propagation with respect to the drawing direction in the sample. These measurements yielded the following important results: (1) The plane strain fracture toughness of the commercially cold-drawn MP35N is about 120 MParootm, and is about 110 MParootm in the cold-drawn and aged condition. (2) The plane stress fracture toughness values for the cold-drawn MP35N were significantly lower than the corresponding values for the cold-drawn and aged material, in spite of the fact that the later had a higher strength value. (3) The direction of the crack propagation did influence the fracture toughness, reducing its value significantly in T-L direction, as compared with values in T-T and L-T directions.

TI Preparation of Ni-Cr-Co-W-Mo-B brazing filler and its weldability
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB Ni-Cr-Co-W-Mo-B powder as a brazing filler was prepared by gas atomization, and its microstructure and melting characteristics were determined by XRD and DSC. The microstructure and composition analyses across the bonded interlayer were performed by SEM. The wettability between Ni-Cr-Co-W-Mo-B alloy and Ni-based superalloy substrate is good. The bond tensile strenghth at 1073 K and stress rupture at 1283 K/248 MPa are 1123 MPa and 43 h respectively. After transient liquid phase bonding and heat treatment, the microstructure and composition of the joint zone resemble those of the superalloy substrate, and the joint properties are almost identical to those of the superalloy substrate.

TI Compressive strain hold effect on high temperature low-cycle fatigue
   crack growth in superalloys
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL
AB Crack growth mechanisms taking into account the oxidation and mean stress effect in nickel- and cobalt-based superalloys were determined by crack growth tests using a strain waveform including compressive strain hold. Cracks were found to propagate on the dendrite boundary in both superalloys. Crack growth rates were increased by increasing the compressive hold time. Oxidation around the crack tip was detected by electron probe micro analysis (EPMA) and was found to accelerate the fatigue crack growth. The oxidation component in the normalized crack growth rate by oxidation is proportional to about the 1/3 power of loading frequency for Ni-based superalloy, whereas the power for Co-based superalloy is about 1/2. Furthermore, mean stresses in the nickel-based superalloy, which has a high proof strength even at high temperature, were increased by the compressive strain hold. It was also found that increasing the mean stress accelerates the crack growth. A crack growth model that considers effects of both oxidation at crack the tip and mean stress was discussed from these test results.

TI High temperature oxidation and corrosion resistant nanocrystalline
   coatings
SO SURFACE ENGINEERING
AB Traditional high temperature oxidation resistant coatings are divided into three types: aluminide or modified aluminide coatings such as Cr-Al, Si-Al and Pt-Al; MCrAlY(M=Fe,Co and/or Ni) overlayer coatings and MCrAlY+Y2O3/ZrO2 thermal barrier coatings. Characteristic of these coatings is that their compositions are very different from their substrate alloys. Protection comes from the higher aluminium content in the coating to form Al2O3 at high temperature. However, these coatings may be harmful to the mechanical properties of the alloys as a result of the interdiffusion or thermal mismatch between the coating and substrate. Recently, a new kind of coating has been developed: high temperature oxidation resistant and hot corrosion resistant nanocrystalline coating, the composition of which is the same as the substrate. The only difference is that the grain size of the coating is several orders of magnitude smaller than that of the substrate. The formation of protective Al2O3 scale is not from the high aluminium. content, but from the grain boundary diffusion. The main advantages of this kind of coating are that neither interdiffusion nor thermal mismatch exist between coating and substrate. The present paper reviews the high temperature oxidation and hot corrosion resistant nanocrystalline coating with particular reference to the authors' own results.

SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB A variety of experimental techniques have been used to investigate the interactions between tungsten carbide (WC-Co 88/12) particulates and the matrix in some new wear resistant cobalt-based superalloy and steel matrix composites produced by hot isostatic pressing. The results show that the chemical composition of the matrix has a strong influence on the interface reaction between WC and matrix and the structural stability of the WC particulates in the composite. Some characteristics of the interaction between matrix and reinforcement are explained by the calculation of diffusion kinetics. The three-body abrasion wear resistance of the composites has been examined based on the ASTM G65-91 standard procedure. The wear behavior of the best composites of this study shows great potential for wear protection applications. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Retardation of sigma-phase transformation in modified superalloy RR2072
SO METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND
   MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB A comparative investigation of sigma-phase transformation in base and modified experimental alloy RR2072 (C, Hf, and B) has been undertaken. The alloys were exposed at 950 degreesC for 5 to 500 hours. It was found that sigma-phase transformation was notably retarded in the modified alloys due to the prior formation of M23C6 carbides and Ta/Ti being tied up in the MC phase. Detailed investigation has revealed that M23C6 carbides absorb Cr, Mo, and Co, consequently retarding sigma-phase transformation that demands Cr, Mo, and Co in addition to Re. In the interdendritic regions, the growth of sigma-phase was physically limited by MC carbides and chemically inhibited by the very localized microsegregation.

TI Atom probe tomography investigation of the microstructure of superalloys
   N18
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB Microstructural features of nickel base superalloys N18 have been investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), field emission gun-scanning electron microscopy (FEG-SEM), field ion microscopy (FIM), one-dimensional atom probe (APFIM) and three-dimensional atom probe (3DAP). Heat treatments conducted at 700 and 800 C lead to the precipitation of a large volume fraction of gamma precipitates (57%) that are Al and Ti enriched. Cr, Co and Mo preferentially partition to the gamma solid solution. Small Cr-enriched particles (0) were discovered in the core of largest gamma particles. These contain more Cr and less Mo than the gamma solid solution but are thought to be tiny metastable gamma particles that were formed in the inner region of gamma particles during cooling from 800 degreesC. Intergranular Ni-depleted borides arranged in "clusters" of particles very close to each other were observed using 3DAP. Their stoichiometry is M2B with M = Cr, Mo. One nanometer-thick Ni and Co enriched films (compared to borides) separate adjoining boride particles. Grain boundary (GB) segregation of B, Mo and to some extent Cr has been observed. The thickness of the segregated layer wetting GB is close to 1 nm. (C) 2002 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Prospect of nickel-based superalloys with low Cr and high Re contents
SO ISIJ INTERNATIONAL
AB There is a clear trend of lowering Cr and increasing Re content in the evolution from the 1st- to the 2nd- and to the 3rd-generation Ni-based single crystal (SC) superalloys. Following this trend, two groups of superalloys were made with the aid of the d-electrons concept. One is the A-group which is characterized by the lower Cr and the higher Re contents in the alloys than in the 3rd-generation SC alloys. A homogeneous microstructure was obtained in these A-group superalloys containing 0, 1 and 2 mass% Cr, while their Re and Co contents were set at about 8.5 mass% and 13.5 mass% respectively. The other is the B-group which is characterized by the lower Re content than the A-group. Three alloys in the B-group containing 2.5, 4.2 and 12.1 mass% Cr were studied for the comparison with the A-group. According to a hot corrosion test, weight gain occurred in a Cr-free alloy instead of observing weight loss in Cr containing alloys. Hot corrosion resistance of 2 mass% Cr alloy was quite good as long as the alloy contains about 8.5 mass% Be. The oxidation resistance was improved remarkably in 1 mass% Cr alloy than in the Cr-free alloy. It was found that the addition of at least 2 mass% Cr into superalloys is necessary in order to keep good surface stability at high temperatures. Also, it was seen that Re is a harmful element for oxidation resistance.

TI In-service degradation of metallurgical and mechanical properties of
   aluminized coatings and substrates in gas turbine blades
SO MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS
AB In-service degradation of metallurgical and mechanical properties of aluminized CoCrAlY coatings and Ni-base superalloy substrates in advanced gas turbine blades has been studied. The aluminized coatings of the unexposed and in-service exposed blades consisted of four layers with different microstructure and chemical composition. In-service environmental attack led to the deposition of Fe oxides on the top aluminized coating and formation of a thin-layered Al2O3. While in-service, Ni diffused extensively from the substrate into the near-surface coating region. The interdiffusion of Co/Ni resulted in the formation of Al/Ni rich precipitates in all the coating regions, except a near-surface coating region indicating Cr rich precipitates. A number of Cr rich precipitates were found in the substrate near the interdiffusion zone. The near-interface coating region and substrate softened at room and elevated temperatures. The ductility and low cycle fatigue life of the internal coating region at room temperature was not degraded. However, the ductility of the internal and near-interface coating regions and substrate at elevated temperatures was substantially degraded. In-service mechanical degradation of the aluminized CoCrAlY coatings is discussed in light of the metallurgical evolution.

AB A new Fe-Ni-Co-Nb-Ti-Si superalloy containing trace additions of selective rare earths and having good combination of very low thermal expansion coefficient, high-resistance to stress accelerated grain boundary oxygen ernbrittlement and fairly good notch-bar rupture strength has been successfully developed. The resistance to oxidation for long time exposure at high-temperatures and the stress rupture life has been improved significantly with trace yttrium addition. The microstructures of the alloys have been studied by means of analytical electron microscopy, chemical and X-ray analysis techniques. The results reveal that the trace Yttrium segregates in the strengthening phase with platelet morphology, and helps in transforming A(3)B type epsilon phase into A(5)B type H phase. The morphology and crystal structures of the grain boundary phases also change with selective additions of rare earth elements. Compared with those in the conventional alloy, the platelet precipitates in the yttrium-containing alloy densely segregate within the grains and along the grain boundaries with smaller size. The segregation of the platelet precipitates within the grains is helpful in improving the strength of the alloy. In addition, its precipitation along the grain boundaries can improve the resistance to stress accelerated grain boundary oxidation and stress rupture property of the alloy and thereby contribute to its temperature stability.

TI Effect of high-temperature protective coatings on fatigue lives of
   nickel-based superalloys
SO FATIGUE & FRACTURE OF ENGINEERING MATERIALS & STRUCTURES
AB This study concerns MCrAlY coatings (M is Ni, Co or both) sprayed by a vacuum plasma spraying process for protection against high-temperature corrosion and oxidation of gas turbine components, such as turbine blades and duct segments. The effect of high-temperature protective coatings on fatigue lives of nickel-based superalloys were investigated at high temperature under push-pull loading and rotary bending and then compared with uncoated superalloys, such as equiaxed IN738LC, unidirectional solidified CM247LC and single-crystal CMSX-2. The high-cycle fatigue lives of MCrAlY-coated superalloys at high temperature under push-pull loading showed an inferior performance when compared with the uncoated superalloys. This was because the crack initiation site was different. The high-cycle fatigue cracks of nickel-based superalloys initiated at casting cavities which were exposed on the specimen surface, whereas the high-cycle fatigue cracks of MCrAlY-coated specimens initiated at interface defects, such as small pores and grid residue, between the MCrAlY coating and the substrate and grew into the MCrAlY coating, and then into the substrate. Similarly, the rotary bending fatigue properties of MCrAlY-coated superalloys at high temperature showed an inferior performance when compared with the uncoated superalloys. This is because of a high stress due to the higher Young's modulus of the MCrAlY coating (in comparison with the substrate) being induced at the MCrAlY coating surface. The crack initiation site was on the specimen surface in both cases of the nickel-based superalloys and the MCrAlY-coated superalloys, respectively. As a result, it was considered that, for rotary bending tests, the fatigue life reduction was due to the high stress that originated from the difference of elastic constants between the MCrAlY coating and the superalloy. Consequently, in fatigue life design it is necessary to take account of the stress levels in a coating layer.

AB Dendritic segregation in conventionally cast, commercially heat treated and exposed MarM002 turbine blades has been investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). During casting Cr, Co and W segregate to the dendrites and Hf, Ti and Ta segregate to the eutectics. As a result of the dissolution of gamma' precipitates in the dendrites and coarsening of gamma' precipitates in the eutectics this segregation aggravates during exposure at 1000 degreesC. At this high exposure temperature homogenisation of dendritic segregation does not occur because it involves long diffusion distances and a low driving force compared with dissolution and coarsening of gamma' precipitates.

AB The investigation of microstructure and chemical composition of the gamma and gamma' phases were performed in a Ni-base superalloy by means of analytical electron microscopy. The distribution of particular elements in the alloy was revealed using X-ray mapping in a transmission electron microscope. The detected concentration profiles of alloying elements at the gamma'/gamma interface were relatively sharp in the case of cuboidal shape of the gamma' phase while they resembled the classical diffusion profile for the oval gamma' phase. The quantitative analysis of the gamma' phase revealed much higher content of Al and lower of Ti, W, Co and Mo in the oval precipitates compared to cuboidal ones. This result is attributed to the different solidification paths, which is eutectic for the cuboidal gamma' precipitates and peritectic for the oval gamma' precipitates.

SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB A high temperature fatigue crack growth study on an experimental disc alloy of approximate composition Ni-14.75Cr-(14-19)Co-4.75Mo-3Al-3.75Ti-1.75Ta-0.7Hf-0.06Zr-0.02C-0.0175B (wt-%) has been undertaken. Comparison of constant load fatigue crack growth tests conducted in air and a vacuum at 725 degreesC and in air at room temperature indicate that an oxidising environment has a major influence on crack growth rates over a wide range of applied stress intensity range. In particular it contributes to enhanced embrittlement of grain boundary regions, promoting an early transition to intergranular failure along with a concomitant increase in growth rate. Constant stress intensity factor range tests at high R ratio showed that a decrease in frequency at 725 degreesC in both air and a vacuum caused an increase in the crack growth rate per cycle due to time dependent crack growth. This was most significant in air at 725 degreesC rather than in vacuo, although in both instances low frequency tests were accompanied by wholly intergranular crack growth. At lower R ratios the influence of time dependent processes is less pronounced, especially in a vacuum. For the purposes of prediction a straightforward linear summation model using sustained load crack growth results combined with high frequency growth rates was found to model reasonably the influence of frequency on crack growth rates for the air tests at 725 degreesC. This can be rationalised by the observation that in air intergranular failure proceeds by linking of prior cracked or embrittled grains some distance ahead of the crack tip. At lower values of stress intensity range a slight under prediction of growth rates was evident, but improvements could be made through the use of triangular waveform data. For the vacuum tests, the linear summation model was consistently found to over predict growth rates due to the transitory nature of the sustained load crack growth rates under repeated loading and was not generally deemed suitable. Under these conditions damage occurs close to the crack tip and direct interaction between time dependent and time independent mechanisms will occur. This is not taken into account by a summation approach and more accurate modelling of damage formation in the varying strain fields ahead of the crack tip is required to predict this.

AB An experimental set-up utilizing indirect induction heating suitable for thermal-mechanical fatigue (TMF) tests of high-temperature materials with thermal barrier coatings (TBC) is described. This set-up employed for TMF testing of the Co-based superalloy MAR-M 509 with a NiCoCrAlY bond coat and a ZrO2 topcoat was able to generate temperature gradients across the TBC similar to the in-service conditions inside a gas turbine. The tests show the development of an extensive inelastic strain during the high temperature compressive part of each cycle usually counterbalanced during the tensile part, a fast saturation of the stress response within the first loading cycles, and an exponential decrease in lifetime with increasing applied mechanical strain range. Micro structural analysis demonstrates that life of the samples was not limited by TBC-related processes but by cracks initiated on oxidized carbides on the uncoated surface of the samples.

TI Structural stability and non-catalytic nucleation inhibition effect of
   Si-Zr-B mould coating on superalloy melt
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The investment moulding technique was first adopted to prepare a SiO2 - ZrO2 - B2O3 (Si - Zr - B) substrate layer on the inner surface of the mould, by employing SiO2 glass dust and ZrO2 powder, SiO2 - ZrO2 sol, and analytical grade H3BO3 as refractory material, binder, and softening agent, respectively. Then using sol - gel processing, seven layers of Si - Zr - B film of the same formula as the aforementioned Si - Zr - B substrate layer were compounded with the substrate layer step by step. After glassing treatment at 850 degreesC for 60 min, this film transformed into a glass lined coating. It was shown from X-ray diffraction analysis that, after holding it at a temperature of 1500 degreesC for 30 min, the amount of crystallinity in the Si - Zr - B coating was about 1 - 3% (vol.%). Finally, the undercooling experiment showed that a large undercooling (up to 140 K) was achieved in a DD3 (Ni - Cr - Mo - Al - Ti - Co - W) single crystal superalloy melt in this coated mould. So it is concluded that a Si - Zr - B coating has got a good structural stability at high temperature and provides ideal non-catalytic nucleation inhibition for an undercooled superalloy.

AB Ni-Cr-Al-P coatings were deposited on the Ni3Al-base superalloys IC-6 and K17 by are-ion plating. The results indicated that a small amount of substrate atoms, such as Co, Ti, Mo, etc., existed in the Ni-Cr-Al-Y coatings near the substrates, probably due to "sputter" and "antisputter." For the alloy K17, the impeding effect of Al was not obvious, because the temperatures of the substrate and the coating were high (420-480 degreesC) during the deposition process and interdiffusion was accelerated. However, for alloy IC-6 which contains Al, as well as a high concentration of Mo, the diffusion of Cr was impeded. Vacuum heat treatment at 1050 degreesC drastically increased diffusivities and the presence of Al and Mo was not enough to prevent some Cr diffusion. Thus, the coating became mor e uniform and close to the desired composition.

TI Sulfidation behavior of Inconel 738 superalloy at 500-900 degrees C
SO OXIDATION OF METALS
AB The high-temperature sulfidation behavior of the cast nickel-base superalloy Inconel 738 (IN-738) was studied over the temperature range 500-900 degreesC in pure sulfur vapor over the range 10(2)-10(4) Pa. The sulfidation kinetics followed the parabolic rate law in all cases. The sulfidation rates increased with increasing temperature and sulfur pressure. The scales formed were bilayered and temperature-dependent. At T less than or equal to 700 degreesC, the outer scale consisted of mostly NiS (with dissolved Co) and minor (CoS2 and NiCo2S4, while the inner layer was a heterophasic mixture of NiS, NiCo2S4, and minor amounts of Al2S3 and chromium sulfide (Cr2S3/Cr3S4) At T greater than or equal to 750 degreesC, the outer scale consisted of mostly Ni3S2 (With dissolved Ca) and minor amounts of Co3S4 and Cr2S3/ Cr3S4, while the inner layer was a complex, heterophasic mixture of Ni3S2, Cr2S3/Cr3S4, CoCr2S4, and minor Al2S3. Platinum markers were found to be located at the interface between the inner and outer scales, suggesting that the outer scale grew by the outward transport of cations and the inner scale grew by the inward transport of sulfur. The formation of Al2S3 and Cr2S3/Cr3S4 partly blocked the transport of cations through the inner scale and consequently reduced the sulfidation rates as compared to pure nickel.

TI Laser repairing surface crack of Ni-based superalloy components
SO TRANSACTIONS OF NONFERROUS METALS SOCIETY OF CHINA
AB Surface crack of components of the cast nickel-base superalloy was repaired with twin laser beams under proper technological conditions. One laser beam was used to melt the substrate material of crack, and the other to fill in powder material to the crack region. The experimental results show that the surface crack with the width of 0.1 similar to0.3 mm. could be repaired under the laser power of 3 kW and the scanning speed of 6 similar to8 mm/s. The repaired deepness of crack region is below 6.5 mm. The microstructure of repaired region is the cellular crystal, columnar crystal dendrite crystal from the transition region to the top filled layer. The phases in repaired region mainly consisted of supersaturated a-Co with plenty of Ni, some Cr and Al, Cr23C6, Co2B, Co-Ni-Mo, M4B3, TiSi and VSi. The hardness of filled layer in repaired region ranged from HV(0.2)450 to HV(0.2)500, and the hardness decreases gradually from the filled layer to joined zone.

TI Analysis of carboneceous deposits from thermal stressing of a JP-8 fuel
   on superalloy foils in a flow reactor
SO INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH
AB A flow reactor study was carried out to investigate the carbon deposition on nickel-, cobalt-, molybdenum-, and iron-based alloy foils during thermal stressing of a JP-8 fuel at 500 degreesC wall temperature and 34 atm (500 psig), for 5 h at a fuel flow rate of 4 mL/min. Temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) analysis and SEM examination showed that the amount and the nature of the carbonaceous deposits on the foils depend strongly on the chemical composition of the foil surface. The amount of carbon deposited on metal foils decreased in the order Inconel 600 > Havar > Fecralloy > Waspaloy > Hastelloy-C > MoRe > Inconel 718. The presence of minor components, such as Ti, Al, and Nb, in the alloys appears to be responsible for reducing carbon deposition from jet fuel thermal stressing. This effect can be attributed to the formation of a passive layer on alloy surfaces that limits the access of deposit precursors to base metals, Ni, Fe, and Co, that catalyze deposit formation.

TI Degradation of gas turbine blade materials in integrated
   coal-gasification combined cycle plant
SO MATERIALS AT HIGH TEMPERATURES
AB Interest in the integrated coal-gasification combined cycle plant (IGCC) has increased because of its high efficiency. However, degradation of gas turbine component materials has not been studied so far. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate the corrosion behaviors of these materials in an actual coal gas combustion environment. Our test facility was constructed near the coal-gasification test facility (CGT) at the Aioi works of Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co., Ltd. Several superalloy (Rene80H and FSX414) and coating systems (CoCrAlY, CoNiCrAlY and TBC) were exposed in the coal gas combustion environment at 1123, 1223 and 1323 K up to 350 h. After these tests, the weight change of each specimen was measured. Morphologies of products and element distributions at their surfaces were observed with SEM and EPMA. It is concluded that not only high- temperature oxidation and sulfidation but also ash deposition has a remarkable influence on the degradation of gas turbine blade materials.

TI Protective coatings for aeronautic and power generation turbines
   components deposited by plasma spray
SO BOLETIN DE LA SOCIEDAD ESPANOLA DE CERAMICA Y VIDRIO
AB Coatings produced by aluminium diffusion, called aluminide are employed to increase the oxidation and corrosion resistance, increasing the life of Ni and Co base superalloys components at temperatures comprised between 900 and 1050 degrees C. Consequently these coatings are frequently employed in aeronautic and Fewer generation turbines as well as in the chemical industry. Aluminides are industrially produced by pack cementation or CVD and recently it has been demonstrated that its resistance significantly increases when Cr is added (chrome-aluminides). During this work, a feasibility study has been carried out in order to determine if plasma spray can be employed for depositing this type of coatings on turbine blades. Therefore, aluminium and aluminium/chromium layers were deposited on Ni base IN100 superalloy specimens that were subsequently subjected to a diffusion heat treatment under Ar flow Characterisation and analysis of the coatings were carried out by metallography, SEM and EDS. Cyclic oxidation tests were carried out at 1050 degrees C while molten sulphate hot corrosion was performed at 900 degrees C. The results of this preliminary study are promising and indicate that plasma spray can be developed as an industrial process for production of aluminide and chrome-aluminide coatings.

TI Sulfidation properties of Ni-20Cr and Ni-13.5Co-20Cr alloys at 873 K
   under low sulfur pressures in H2S-H-2 atmospheres
SO OXIDATION OF METALS
AB The sulfidation properties of Ni-20Cr and Ni-13.5Co-20Ci alloys as well as a nickel-base superalloy AISI685 were investigated at 873 K in H2S-H-2 gas mixtures with sulfur partial pressures of 10(-4), 10(-5.5), and 10(-7) Pa by mass-gain measurements, electron-probe microanalysis (EPMA), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. Sulfidation obeyed the parabolic rate law, and the parabolic rate Constants decreased in the order Ni-20Cr, Ni-13.5Co-20Cr, and AISI685 at each sulfur pressure. With decreasing sulfur pressure, the rate constants first decreased slowly and then rapidly at a 10(-7) Pa sulfur pressure. At both 10(-4) and 10(-5.5) Pa sulfur pressures, Ni-20Cr formed a surface scale with a duplex structure of inner (Cr3S4) and outer (Ni3S2) layers, while Ni-13.5Co-20Cr formed a triplex structure of inner (Cr3S4), intermediate (Ni, Co) Cr2S4, and outer [Ni3S2+(Co,Ni)(9)S-8] layers. The surface scale formed on AISI685 was very complex, comprising at least four layers, a fibrous (Co,Ni)(9)S-8 top surface, outer [Ni3S2+(Co,Ni)(9)S-8], and intermediate [(Cr,Ti)(3)S-4] layers, as well as an inner layer containing Ci, Ti, Mo, Al, and S. At the 10(-7) Pa sulfur pressure, which is lower than the dissociation pressure of Ni3S2, both Ni-20Cr and Ni-13.5Co-20Cr formed a surface scale of Cr3S4 covered by a thin NiCr2S4 layer, accompanied by copious internal sulfidation of Cr3S4 and/or CrS. On AISI685 there was a surface scale of (Cr,Ti)(3)S-4 accompanied by the usual internal sulfidation. It is discussed that diffusion of cations in the inner Cr3S4 layer is the rate-determining step for the growth of the multilayer structures. At the 10(-7) Pa sulfur pressure, diffusion of Cr and S contribute to form a thin surface scale and internal sulfidation, respectively.

TI Influence of cold-work and aging heat treatment on strength and

SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB MP35N (35% Co, 35% Ni, 20% Cr, and 10% Mo) is a superalloy that exhibits a remarkable combination of high strength and high fracture toughness. This alloy derives its strength mainly from two processes - cold work and a subsequent aging heat treatment. This study examines the influence of the amount of cold-work, imposed in the drawing and the rolling processes, and the subsequent aging heat treatment on the strength and ductility (which is also an indicator of toughness) of this alloy. It was found that high levels of cold-work followed by the aging heat treatments resulted in a drastic drop in the ductility of the alloy. This drastic loss of ductility was correlated with appearance of macro-scale shear bands in the samples. The physical origin of these localized shear bands is investigated in this paper. Furthermore, this study established a processing window for MP35N (in cold-drawing and cold-rolling processes) where the aging heat treatment provides the desired increase in the strength without adversely influencing the ductility of the alloy.

TI Damage mechanisms of coated systems under thermomechanical fatigue
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The damage mechanisms of several kinds of coatings on a single crystal nickel base superalloy under thermomechanical fatigue (TMF) are described. The systems investigated were diffusion platinum aluminide coatings, Co-Ni-Cr-Al-Y overlay coatings, and thermal barrier coatings (TBCs). The TMF experiments were carried out on hollow specimens over a temperature range from 300 to 1050 degrees C, at strain ranges Delta epsilon = 0.5 and 0.7%, and at a strain ratio R = -infinity. No coating cracking was found for the platinum aluminide coating. Instead, specimens failed owing to oxidation induced crack initiation from the uncoated inner surface of the hollow testpieces, although coating surface roughening caused by non-homogeneous oxidation was observed. For the overlay coating, roughening in terms of coating rumpling and coating cracking occurred, resulting in reduced TMF life, For TBC-specimens with a thin ceramic coating processed by electron beam-physical vapour deposition (EB-PVD), TMF life was compatible with that of specimens with the overlay coating. Failure once again occurred owing to Co-Ni-Cr-Al-Y bond coat cracking and propagation into the substrate. In this system, some bond coat cracks penetrated through the top ceramic coat although others did not. In contrast with specimens coated with the overlay alone, no significant rumpling on the bond coat surface was observed and the crack density was low. MST/4233.

SO JOURNAL OF THE JAPAN INSTITUTE OF METALS
AB The creep rupture life of nickel-base superalloys has been predicted using a neural network model within a Bayesian framework. The rupture life was modelled as a function of some 42 variables, including temperature, chemical composition: Cr, Co, C, Si, Mn, P, S, Mo, Cu, Ti, Al, B, N, Nb, Ta, Zr, Fe, W, V, Hf, Re, Mg, ThO2, La, four steps of heat treatment (each has its own temperature, duration and cooling rate), sample shape, solidification method, yield strength, ultimate tensile strength and elongation. The Bayesian method puts error bars on the predicted value of the rupture life and allows the significance of each individual factor to be estimated. The scale of the error bars changes with the accuracy of the prediction: it is large when the prediction is uncertain, indicating that the whole prediction system is reliable.

TI Precipitation behaviors of gamma ', epsilon and eta phases in
   Fe-Ni-Co-Nb based superalloys
SO TETSU TO HAGANE-JOURNAL OF THE IRON AND STEEL INSTITUTE OF JAPAN
AB An Fe-38Ni-13Co-4.7Nb-1.5Ti-0.4Si alloy (alloy 909) and an Fe-29.5Ni-19.7Co-4.0Nb-1.3Ti-0.6Al-0.4Si alloy (alloy 929) are the latest low thermal expansion superalloys. This study was carried out to elucidate the relation between the age-hardening and the precipitation behaviors of gamma', epsilon and eta phases in these alloys by micro Vickers hardness test and transmission electron microscopy.
   The results obtained in this study are as follows;
   (1) In aging at 893K hardening proceeds gradually with aging time and reaches to the maximum hardness; the hardness after aging for 720 ks in alloys 909 and 929 are HV400 and HV460, respectively. The rate of hardening increases with increaseing aging temperature. After reaching to the maximum hardness the hardness decreases gradually because of the coarsening of gamma' phase and the precipitation of epsilon and eta phases. The precipitation and growth rates of these phases in alloy 929 are lower than those in alloy 909.
   (2) The precipitation in alloy 909 follows in a sequence of supersaturated gamma phase --> gamma' phase --> Widmanstatten epsilon phase --> cellular eta phase. That in alloy 929 follows in a sequence of supersaturated gamma phase --> gamma' phase --> Widmanstatten (epsilon + eta) phases.
   (3) The main constituent elements of the epsilon and eta phases in these alloys are Ni, Co, Nb, Ti, and Fe and Ni, Nb, Co, Fe, and Si, respectively. The epsilon phase contains more Co and less Ni contents than the phase. There is no distinct difference in the composition between the Widmanstatten and cellular eta phases.

TI Influence of crystallographic orientation and stress waveforms on
   fatigue strength of single crystals of a Ni-base superalloy
SO JOURNAL OF THE JAPAN INSTITUTE OF METALS
AB The stress-controlled fatigue tests were performed at 700 degrees C. In this study, two kinds of fatigue testing procedures were adopted. One is the tension-compression triangle-waveform test (R = -1). The other is the tensile or compressive stress hold testing procedures. Cracks initiated at casting pores under tensile stress conditions. Only in compressive stress hold test, crack was initiated by stage I cracking (crystallographic cracking on the {111} slip plane). In [011] and [(1) over bar 11], the transition from mode I cracking (perpendicular to the principal stress axis) to mode II-type crystallographic cracking on the {111} slip plane was occurred easily because there were not enough non-co-planar slip systems in order to relax: the stress concentration near the crack-tip.
   The [001] crystals showed stable mode I crack growth because the stress concentration at crack-tip was relaxed by homogeneous multiple slip. The creep-fatigue damage mechanisms were found to be divided into two groups. In the case of the [001]-compressive and [011]-tensile stress hold waveforms, deformation occurred by mechanical-twin shear through gamma and gamma'. On the other hand, in the case of the [001]-tensile and [011]-compressive stress hold waveforms, each gamma' particle was sheared by superlattice partial with the fault bounded Shockley partial because the direction of shear stress on the (111) plane was opposite to that of microtwin formation. Fatigue lifetimes were decreased by the formation of deformation twinning.

SO JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING FOR GAS TURBINES AND POWER-TRANSACTIONS OF THE
   ASME
CT 41st International Gas Turbine and Aeroengine Congress and Exhibition
CY JUN 10-13, 1996
CL BIRMINGHAM, ENGLAND
AB INCONEL(R) alloy 783 is art oxidation-resistant low coefficient of thermal expansion (low CTE) superalloy developed for gas turbine applications. Turbine efficiency can be increased through the use of low-CTE shrouds and case components that maintain tight blade tip clearances at different turbine operating temperatures. To achieve low CTE, alloys based on Ni-Fe-Co compositions require Cr content be maintained at low levels. Added Cr lowers the Curie temperature and thereby increases thermal expansion rate over a wider temperature range. The necessary lack of Cr minimizes resistance to both general oxidation and stress-accelerated grain boundary oxygen enhanced cracking (SAGBO). Increased amounts of Al in alloys strengthened by y' alone also promotes SAGBO. Alloy 783 is the culmination in the development of an alloy system with very high aluminum content that, in addition to forming y', causes beta aluminide phase precipitation in the austenitic matrix. It was discovered that this type of structure can be processed to resist both SAGBO and general oxidation, while providing low thermal expansion and useful mechanical properties up to 700 degrees C. The high Al content also reduces density to 5 percent below that of superalloys such as INCONEL alloy 718. Key aspects of the alloy development are presented, including the assessment of SAGBO resistance by evaluating elevated temperature crack growth in air The alloy, now commercially available, has been successfully fabricated and welded into gas turbine engine components.

TI Solid-state diffusion welding of wrought AISI 304 stainless steel to
   nimonic AP-1 superalloy powder by hot isostatic pressing
SO WELDING JOURNAL
AB The diffusion welding characteristics of wrought AISI 304 stainless steel to a superalloy powder Nimonic AP-1 were examined in this study. After encapsulation, evacuation and degassing, the welds were hot isostatically pressed (HIPed) in two different cycles, i.e., 1200 degrees C (2192 degrees F)/3 h/147 MPa and 1270 degrees C (2318 degrees F)/3 h/121 MPa. A variation in surface condition of slain less steel was also studied for its influence on properties of the joints. These diffusion welded joints were characterized for diffusion of alloying elements, microstructural features and tensile properties.
   Most specimens showed good weld strength for both the hot isostatic pressing (HIP) cycles, except specimens with sand blasted surfaces, which gave negligible ductility because of the presence of sand particles embedded on the surface. In general, the tensile properties of the diffusion welded specimens were limited by the mechanical properties of stainless steel and not the joint interface. The microstructural examination of a HIP welded joint showed a thin weld zone of 30 - 40 mu m. While the stainless steel region of the welded specimen showed a relatively clean structure, the Nimonic AP-1 region showed precipitation of dark particles near the interface extending over 20-60 mu m. Electron microprobe analysis of the diffusion welded zone revealed enrichment of titanium-rich particles along prior particle boundaries (PPBs) near the interface. Electron microprobe analysis further revealed extensive diffusion of Ni, Co and Al elements into stainless steel and that of Fe into Nimonic AP-1 superalloy indicating complex composition of the weld interlayer.

AB A mathematical description has been proposed to capture the complex four-stage strain hardening behavior of low stacking fault energy (SFE) polycrystalline fee metallic alloys that deform plastically by both slip and twinning mechanisms. Tt has been demonstrated that the proposed model is capable of predicting fairly accurately the measurements reported previously on the strain-hardening responses of several fee alloys, including brasses (varying Zn content), stainless steels, and a Co-Ni superalloy, deformed to large strains in simple compression tests. For a set of alloys with a wide range of SFEs but with roughly the same initial average grain size, it was demonstrated that only one material parameter in the proposed model was influenced by the stacking fault energy of the alloy; all other parameters normalized by the shear modulus of the alloy maintained approximately the same value. The parameters that are strongly influenced by the grain size have been identified for these alloys. A physical interpretation has been provided for the various material parameters in the proposed strain-hardening model. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.. All rights reserved.

   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB The resistance to stress-accelerated grain boundary oxygen embrittlement (SAGBO) in Fe-Ni-Co-Nb-Ti controlled low expansion superalloy has been improved by trace yttrium element addition. The platelet precipitates in the alloy have been studied by means of optical microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, convergent beam electron microscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction technique. The crystal structure and the chemical composition of the platelet phase have been determined. The phase has a CaCu5-type crystal structure (space group P6/mmm) with lattice parameters a = 0.498 nm and c = 0.408 nm. The crystallographic orientation relationship between the phase and the matrix is found to be (<(11)over bar>1)(gamma)/(0001)(H), [(1) over bar 10](gamma)/[11 (2) over bar 0](H). High-resolution images show that the interface between the platelet phase and the matrix is semicoherent and some stacking faults have been found in the platelet phase. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science S.A.

TI Molecular dynamics simulation of composition dependence of cohesive

   superalloys
SO MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS JIM
AB Molecular dynamics simulations were used to analyze lattice constant a, cohesive energy E-0, and elastic constants c(11) and c(12) of nickel-based superalloys with Al, Ti, V, Cr, Co, Ni, Nb, Mo, Hf, Ta, W, and Re additions. Interatomic potential parameters were evaluated for various additive elements, Ni, and Ni3Al so that lattice constant a, cohesive energy E-0 and elastic constants c(11) and c(12) could be reproduced. Changes of all physical quantities evaluated here were found to be proportional to the changes of concentration of additive elements. The dependencies were fitted by the linear least square method and the obtained parameters were saved as a database. The calculated slope parameters of the lattice constant were compared to measured slope parameters for various additives in the gamma phase. The measured slope parameters were reproduced very well.

TI Analysis of the dislocation content in a deformed Co-based superalloy by
   transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction
SO ZEITSCHRIFT FUR METALLKUNDE
AB The present paper compares the dislocation densities as determined in a Go-based superalloy (CoNi22Cr22W14) after creep and tensile deformation by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and X-ray profile analysis (XRD). After creep tests the dislocation densities obtained by both methods are in good agreement, which is the result of ii nearly homogeneous dislocation distribution. The relationship between the dislocation density and the flow stress meets the Taylor equation. After tensile deformation the dislocation densities determined by TEM and XRD differ systematically from each other, but in both cases also a Taylor relationship can be obtained. The constant a of the dislocation interaction derived by TEM is much larger than in the creep tests and also than that of the XRD, which agrees well with the creep date. The difference between the TEM and the XRD results is the consequence of the dislocation cell structure much more developed in the tensile specimens, which leads to an underestimation of the dislocation density in TEM because of overweighting the cell interior. By fitting the Fourier coefficients of the X-ray diffraction line shapes with a bimodal distribution of the defect content (composite model), dislocation densities of the cell interior can be estimated that correspond well to the TEM data.

AB Employing a basic, gas phase-permeation measurement procedure and modern, ultra-high vacuum technology, measurements were made of the hydrogen permeability and diffusivity in a commercially available Co based superalloy. The transport parameters were determined over a pressure range of 0.013-1.2x10(5) Pa and temperature range, 490-1150 K. The hydrogen solubility was estimated from the relationship between the permeability and diffusivity. The solubility obtained from these measurements is compared with published data for the equilibrium hydrogen solubility in pure Co. Similar anomalies are observed in both solubility measurements.

SO MATERIALS CHARACTERIZATION
AB A new cast superalloy with composition of 8.48 Cr, 9.68 W, 1.76 Mo, 4.52 Al, 0.95 Ti, 9.55 Co, 1.02 Nb, 5.16 Ta, 0.07 Hf, 0.082 Zr, 0.013 B, 0.11 C, Ni bal. (wt.%) was prepared by the investment casting process. The alloy was solution annealed at 1553K for 2h and then air cooled, followed by a two-step aging treatment for 5h at 1293K and then air cooled, followed by 1143K and air cooled to room temperature. The microstructural characteristics were evaluated through optical and electron microscopic observations. Electro probe microanalysis and energy-dispersive analysis of X-rays were conducted to study the (W, Mo)-rich phase precipitated in the new alloy. The results showed that the alloy is coarse grained (similar to 5mm) with serrated grain boundaries and a relatively homogeneous composition. This alloy contains uniform gamma-gamma' microstructure and a fine, discrete W-Mo-containing phase together with discrete carbides M6C and M23C6, which coexist at grain boundaries. All of these microstructural features are thought to be beneficial to the superior creep rupture life of the newly developed nickel-base superalloy. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1997.

AB The isothermal oxidation behavior at 900 and 1100 degrees C in pure oxygen of several commercial single-crystal Ni-base superalloys (CMSX2, CMSX4, CMSX6, AM3, MC2, SRR99) and modified versions of some of them has been investigated. Oxide scales formed at 900 degrees C are adherent and reveal the dendritic microstructure of the subjacent alloy. These scales are composed of three layers 1- (Ti,Co,Ni)-rich oxides, 2- Cr-rich oxides and 3- (Ta,W,Ti)-rich oxides. Al-internal oxidation zone and y' depleted zone are identified. Oxide scales formed at 1100 degrees C are not adherent and spall off extensively regardless of cooling rate. The critical temperature drop to initiate spallation (Delta T) depends on the oxide layer thickness (xi) and the interfacial rupture energy (y(F)). For a given oxide/metal couple (Delta T)(2) xi/y(F), is constant (EVANS and LOBB model). AM3 and CMSX4 alloys follow this model while AM3 and MC2 modified alloys have different behavior. Addition of Si and Hf and substitution of Mo by Re or Pt and Ti by Ta improve oxidation resistance at 900 degrees C and scale adherence at 1100 degrees C.

AB The useful operating life of superalloy components operating in gas turbines is dependent to a large extent on the ability of applied surface coatings to resist corrosive degradation. Coatings have been fine-tuned over many years of use to give satisfactory performance in airborne applications, but the recent adoption of I:as turbines in the utility sector has placed renewed demand on the need to evaluate and develop existing and new coating systems. This paper describes the behaviour of a series of vacuum plasma sprayed MCrAlY(Si) and Al/Si coatings applied to the Ni-base IN738 and UD520 and Co-base FSX-414 and X45 superalloys. Test specimens have been exposed to both simple argon-O-2-SO2 gas mixtures and to simulated combustion gas mixtures in a low-velocity burner rig for times up to 1000 hours in the temperature range 800 to 1000 degrees C, The results obtained in the form of microstructural changes suggest an upper temperature limit below 900 degrees C for the application of high Al anti Si-containing coatings due to interdiffusion with the base alloy and a strong influence of combustion gas composition on corrosion rate.

SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB A detailed analysis of the time-dependent factors affecting the chromium-aluminization of the nickel-base superalloy Rene 80H in cementation packs at 1120 degrees C has been carried out. The packs contained a 4% NaCl+2% NH4Cl mixed activator and a Cr-5 wt.% Al master alloy. The analysis involved measuring the residual pack activator-mixture content and master alloy composition as functions of deposition time, and using the data to calculate equilibrium partial pressures in the pack as a function of time. It is shown that both activator-mixture content and master alloy composition change with time, consequently leading to changes in the pack gas phase composition. The changes in the pack environment are then used to explain the time-dependence of coating surface composition: a simplified mechanism involving a combined parabolic accumulation of beta-NiAl and two-stage linear accumulation of alpha-Cr is described.

The weld microstructure consisted of fine (10- to 50-nm) irregularly shaped gamma' precipitates (0.65 to 0.75 volume fraction) within the gamma matrix. APFIM compositions of the gamma and gamma' phases were found to be different from those in the base metal. Concentration profiles across the gamma and gamma' phases showed extensive variations of Cr, Co and Al concentrations as a function of distance within the gamma phase. Calculated lattice misfits near the gamma/gamma' interface in the welds are positive values compared to the negative values for base metal.

TI Precipitates in wrought Ni-Fe base superalloy 706
SO JOURNAL OF THE JAPAN INSTITUTE OF METALS
AB Ni-Fe-base wrought superalloy 706 is a relatively new alloy and has been used for high temperature services. However, the precipitation in this ahoy system has not been well understood, making it difficult to interpret its strengthening behavior. Therefore, an intensive TEM study was conducted in the present study to characterize the precipitates in Ahoy 706. Samples taken from a gas turbine disk forging were solution-treated at 1253 K for 3 h and stabilizing-treated in a range of 1053 to 1173 K for 1.5 h, followed by the double-aging at 993 K for 8 h and at 893 K for 8 h. Two types of y'-y '' co-precipitates, not reported previously for Alloy 706, were identified in the grain matrix together with fine y '' and large y' phases. One was fine y'-y '' co-precipitates having the core of y' being over-laid with y '' on its top and/or bottom, the other was large y'-y '' co-precipitates having the core of y' being completely covered with y ''. The eta phase was identified at the grain boundary and found to be accompanied by a serrated grain boundary and denuded zone. The fine overlaid y'-y '' co-precipitates and the fine y '' phase formed at the double-aging, whereas the relatively large cuboidal y'-y '' co-precipitates, large y' phase and inter-granular eta phase formed at the stabilizing treatment below 1113 K.

SO TETSU TO HAGANE-JOURNAL OF THE IRON AND STEEL INSTITUTE OF JAPAN
AB For Mi-Fe-base superalloy 706, a stabilizing treatment between solution-annealing and age- hardening treatments has been proposed to improve its creep rupture life. The precipitation behavior of Alloy 706 was investigated in the present study and related with creep rupture properties. Samples taken from a gas turbine disk forging were solution-treated al 980 degrees C for 3 h and stabilizing-treated in a range of 780 to 900 degrees C for 1.5 h, followed by the double-aging at 720 degrees C for 8 h and at 620 degrees C for 8 h. Precipitation behavior of these samples was examined by SEM and TEM, and creep rupture tests were conducted at three conditions. Four kinds of intra-granular precipitates were identified: fine gamma'-gamma '' coprecipitates having the core of gamma' being overlaid with gamma '' on its top and/or bottom, large gamma'-gamma '' co-precipitates having the core of gamma' being completely covered with gamma '', large gamma' precipitates and fine gamma '' precipitates. At the grain boundary eta was identified and found to be accompanied by a serrated grain boundary and denuded zone. Such precipitation behavior was significantly affected by stabilizing temperature, especially below 840 degrees C, and so was creep rupture property accordingly. It is concluded that the best creep rupture properties are obtained when an optimum combination is established among intra-granular fine gamma'-gamma '' co-precipitates, intra-granular large gamma'-gamma '' co-precipitates, and the inter-granular eta phase.

AB The cyclic stress response behaviour of a gamma' hardened Nimonic PE-16 superalloy in a prior-aged microstructural condition showed hardening, softening and saturation regime's when tested at 823 K at a strain rate of 3 x 10(-3) s(.)(-1) Tests were performed at strain amplitudes in the range +/-0.25 to +/-1.0% in a servohydraulic system in total axial strain control mode. Transmission electron microscopy of samples fatigue tested to various fractions of life, representative of the three regimes, indicated that the dislocations get accumulated in slip bands; softening was caused by repeated shearing of gamma' by planar dislocations which led to a gradual reduction in their projected size in the slip plane. Finally precipitates were completely offset in the slip plane and in the saturation regime dislocations were piled up against the slip band intersections. An analysis of the work hardening behaviour of the alloy in the tensile portions of the successive hysteresis loops was performed using Estrin-Mecking's models. Linear variation of theta sigma with sigma(2) and agreement between the experimental and computed stress-strain curves indicated the applicability of the modified Estrin-Mecking model. From the dislocation mean free path computed from the model as a function of successive cycles, it is suggested that the reduction in the gamma' precipitate size due to repeated shearing causes cyclic softening. Further it is proposed that slip band intersections adas impediments to the dislocation motion in the saturation regime. The mean slip band spacing computed was found to agree well with the measured values.

AB The microstructural development in PWA-1480 superalloy electron beam welds (Ni-11.0at%Al-11.5%Cr-1.9%Ti-5.1%Co-4.0%Ta-1.3%W) was characterized. Optical microscopy revealed a branched dendritic structure in the weld metal. Transmission electron microscopy of these welds, in the as-welded condition, showed fine cuboidal (0.05-0.5 mu m) L1(2)-ordered gamma' precipitates within the gamma grains. The average volume percentage of the gamma' precipitates was found to be similar to 75%. Atom probe analyses revealed that the composition of the gamma matrix was Ni-4.6at%Al-25.5%Cr-0.4%Ti-9.4%Co-0.8%Ta-2.9%W and that of the gamma' precipitates was Ni-18.2at%Al-2.6%Cr-2.4%Ti-2.8%Co-7.1%Ta-1.5%W. These compositions were compared with the previous APFIM analyses of commercial PWA-1480 single crystals that had received conventional heat treatments. Small differences were found in the chromium and aluminum levels and these may be due to the nonequilibrium nature of phase transformations that occur during weld cooling. No solute segregation was detected at the gamma-gamma' interface. The APFIM results were also compared with the thermodynamic calculations of alloying element partitioning between the gamma and gamma' phases using the ThermoCalc(TM) program.

AB Single crystals of the rhenium-containing nickel-base superalloy CMSX-4 were investigated using a time of flight atom probe. The distribution of the alloying elements in the two phases, matrix (gamma phase) and precipitate (gamma' phase), was studied. The high spatial resolution of the atom probe allows to analyse the gamma-gamma' interface. The transition from matrix to gamma' phase takes place within one atomic layer. The boundary is enriched with titanium. Layer-by-layer analysis of (001) planes of the L1(2) ordered gamma' phase reveals alternating Ni- and Al-rich planes. The probability of site occupation by different elements could be evaluated. An approximate formula of the gamma' phase is given by (Ni-81 Ti-3 Ta-2 Cr-5 Co-7 W-2)(3) (Ni-20 Al-70 Ta-6 Co-2 W-2). Rhenium is found mainly in the matrix and has a tendency to build clusters.

AB Stellite, a Co-base superalloy, exhibits good resistance to wear and corrosion. However, this good resistance to wear is sometimes less pronounced in some industrial applications such as steel mill equipment. The present study was therefore conducted to improve this impoverishment of wear property of Stellite. The maximum hardness after plasma nitriding was measured as 1300 HK 0.01, which was facilitated by the formation of CrN. It was found that plasma nitriding at 823 K exhibited relatively higher hardness and a thinner compound layer than plasma nitriding at 973 K. However, the hardness decreased drastically at 1073 K. Plasma nitrocarburizing was also applied with the parameters of optimized conditions for plasma nitriding with the addition of methane gas to are 80%N-2-H-2 gas mixture. The maximum hardness after plasma nitrocarburizing was about 1200 HK 0.01 and the thickness of layer was about 30 mu m while it was 8 mu m after plasma nitriding. It was indicated that carbon was uniformly distributed in the diffusion layer while the distribution of nitrogen was rich only at the compound layer. Surface conditions after plasma diffusion treatment are also discussed.

SO JOURNAL OF MICROSCOPY-OXFORD
AB The chemical microstructure of Ni-base superalloy/Al2O3 metal-matrix composites (MMCs) has been studied by scanning ion microprobe microanalysis, using the secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) technique. The MMCs were fabricated using the transient-liquid-phase bonding (TLP) process, with B-doped superalloy powder as an interlayer. Boron was found to diffuse rapidly throughout the matrix to form boride phases, mostly at the grain boundaries in the matrix. These borides contain excess Cr (also Mo, Si, W) in comparison with the Ni alloy-matrix, but are depleted in Ni (also in Al and Co). Carbides form at the grain boundaries as thin platelets and inside the grains as fine particles. Chemical reaction occurs between the sapphire fibre and the matrix; formation of NiAl2O4 spinel at the interface is suggested. This interface reaction layer is friable and parts of it peel off during consolidation to become inclusions in the matrix near the fibre/matrix interface.

TI PHASE-STABILITY, OXIDATION, AND INTERDIFFUSION OF A NOVEL NI-CR-AL-TI-SI
   BOND-COATING ALLOY BETWEEN 900-DEGREES-C AND 1100-DEGREES-C
SO OXIDATION OF METALS
AB A novel, low-expansion experimental Ni-Cr-Al-Ti-Si bond-coating alloy was investigated in the as-cast state concerning its phase stability, oxidation resistance in ail, and interdiffusion with single-crystal IN-100 at 900, 1000, and 1100 degrees C. Isothermal oxidative thermogravimetry was employed up to 500 hr. Interdiffusion was compared to a commercial Ni-Co-Cr-Al-Y alloy on IN-100. Oxidized Ni-Cl-Al-Ti-Si specimens and diffusion couples were characterized by metallography, SEM, EDX, XRD, and XRF. The Ni-Cr-Al-Ti-Si alloy provides good oxidation resistance in aii at least up to 1000 degrees C. The alloy is an alumina former. Due to its coarse microstructure, other oxides (e.g., rutile) may form and considerably nominate the oxidation behavior. The kinetics of oxidation were correlated with temperature, formation of phases, and morphology of oxides. Interdiffusion fluxes between Ni-Cr-Al-Ti-Si and IN-100 were mainly directed to the superalloy. They were faster than in Ni-Co-Cr-Al-Y/IN-100 diffusion couples.

TI EVALUATION OF PARTITIONING RATIOS OF RE ATOMS IN
   NI-AL-RE-X(X-CR,MO,W,TI,TA,NB,CO) QUATERNARY ALLOYS
SO TETSU TO HAGANE-JOURNAL OF THE IRON AND STEEL INSTITUTE OF JAPAN
AB In order to examine alloying behaviour of rhenium (Re) and its effect on the properties of Ni-based superalloys, the partitioning ratio of Re atoms between the gamma and the gamma' phases and also the phase stability were investigated using Ni-Al-Re-X(X : Cr, Mo, W, Ti, Ta, Nb, Co) quaternary alloys. When those elements, X, which occupy preferably either Al sites or both Ni and Al sites in the Ni3Al(gamma') compound were added to the Ni-Al-Re ternary alloys, the trend of the partitioning of the Re atoms into the gamma phase became considerably high in these alloys. Also, the compositional limit of a gamma + gamma' two phase region in the phase diagram was found to be 3 similar to 4(mol%) for X(X : Mo, W, Ta, Nb) and 5 similar to 6(mol%) for Ti in Ni-Al-Re-X quaternary alloys. The results on the partitioning ratio were analyzed with the alloying vectors defined by two d-electrons parameters. As the result, it was shown that the partitioning behaviour of Re atoms in the Ni-Al-Re-X quaternary alloys were predictable using the alloying vectors.

TI FABRICATION OF FULLY DENSIFIED NI3AL INTERMETALLIC COMPOUND AND NI+NI3AL
   2 PHASES ALLOY BY PRESSURELESS SINTERING OF NIAL+NI MIXED POWDER
   COMPACTS
SO JOURNAL OF THE JAPAN INSTITUTE OF METALS
AB The pressureless sintering densification characteristic of NiAl + Ni mixed powder, the composition of which was mainly in Ni3Al intermetallic compound and Ni + Ni3Al two phase alloy, was investigated. It was found that completely densified compacts of Ni3Al intermetallic compound and Ni + Ni3Al alloy with a large amount of Ni3Al could be obtained by controlling the powder particle size and the sintering condition, though the densification of Ni-rich (82-100 at%Ni) sintered compacts was incomplete. These results were thought to be explained by the authors' theory of ''Equilibrium gas pressure'', i.e., ''The densification in the final stage of solid phase sintering is affected by whether the equilibrium pressure of the gas (CO in this case) generated by the reduction of oxide is higher or lower than the surface stress (the driving force of the shrinkage) of the closed pores'', which have been reported in the previous papers. The bending strength and hardness of the completely densified Ni3Al intermetallic compound were 1.3 GPa and 330 H(V), respectively, and those of Ni+Ni3Al alloy were 2.9 GPa and 310 H(V), respectively.

AB The broad faces of plate-like DO19 precipitates of a (Ni, Co) base superalloy are decorated with triangular networks of linear singularities (LS's) accomodating the 2.5% isotropic length misfit in the atomically dense planes (111)fcc parallel-to(0001)DO19. High-resolution electron microscopy images depict the detailed atomic cores of two of these LS's and show that they are associated with ledges of two (111) spacings in height. The elastic fields surrounding the IS's are analyzed by using both multislice computations and the Somigliana dislocation model in anisotropic elasticity theory. As a result, the Burgers-vector content of the observed ledges is found to be 1/6[112] vectors.

TI EROSION RESISTANT COATING BY LOW-PRESSURE PLASMA SPRAYING
SO ISIJ INTERNATIONAL
AB Cavitation erosion and drain erosion are major causes of failure of mechanical devices in fluid handling systems. The authors investigated the application of plasma spraying technique to the formation of coatings with high resistance against the cavitation and drain erosion damage. By using low pressure plasma spraying, some coatings of cermet and metallic alloy materials were prepared and tested for the cavitation erosion behavior. Cobalt base alloy coating shows much more excellent resistance to the erosion than that of Stellite-6, which has been widely used as the wrought product to shield a steam turbine blade from the damage. In spite of the similar chemical composition of the Co alloy to that of Stellite-6, the erosion-performance is different. Microscopic characterization of the deposite reveals that the superiority of the coating is caused by the extended solid solubility of carbon resulted from the rapid solidification of the sprayed droplets.

AB The structure formed in the crater of Nl-Al-Ti-Cr-Co-W-Mo-Nb-Hf-C-B nickel superalloy subjected to centrifugal atomization was studied. A marked difference was found in the behavior of boron and carbon in the subsurface layer of the crater caused by the significantly deeper zone of homogeneous solid solution distribution of boron (down to 1 mm) compared to that of carbon (0.1 mm).
   Cracks up to 10 mm deep were revealed, caused. apparently, by the thermal gradient on electrode atomization accompanied by the formation of liquation pores resulting from intense boron migration to cracks and, further along cracks to the surface. The composition of boride and carbide phases was determined. The mechanism of crater structure formation was suggested.

TI SOLUTE ELEMENT DISTRIBUTION AND CARBIDE FORMATION IN NI-BASE SUPERALLOYS
   FABRICATED BY RHEOCASTING
SO MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS JIM
AB An investigation was made on the effect of rotational stirring on the microstructures, distribution of solute elements, carbide formation, phosphorus segregation, and distribution coefficients between solid and liquid phases in the Ni-base superalloy TMP-3 (Ni-11.15%Cr-6.74%Co-3.12%Mo-3.98%Al-2.74%Ti-3.93%Nb-3.25%W) by rheocasting with the rotation of a stirrer in the range of 20 to 70 rev / s. The main results obtained are summarized as follows: (1)  When the TMP-3 superalloy was sufficiently agitated at 70 s-1 from the start of solidification, the dendrite structure was broken up and an equiaxed grain structure with the average primary solid particle size of 65 +/- 15 mum was formed. (2) The distributions of Ni,Cr,Co,Al,Ti,Mo,Nb,W,P and C in the super alloy TMP-3 ingots rheocast at 70 s-1 and stationary cast were measured by using a computer-aided microanalyzer (CMA). The concentrations of main eight metallic elements in the center of equiaxed grains in the rheocast alloy were almost equal to those in the center of dendrites in the stationary cast alloy. (3) It was observed from the measurement on the distribution of Ti and Al that the size of gamma' phases in the rheocast alloy tend to decrease as compared with that in the stationary cast one. (4) It was observed that granular MC carbides containing mainly Nb, Ti and Mo precipitate uniformly along the grain boundary in the rheocast alloy, although the plate-like MC carbides precipitate in the grain boundary of the stationary cast alloy. (5) The distribution of P measured by CMA showed that P segregates considerably in the grain boundary, but the degree of phosphorous segregation in the rheocast alloy tend to decrease as compared with that in the stationary cast one. (6) The solid-liquid distribution coefficients estimated from the concentration of main eight elements in the center of primary crystals were almost consistent with the equilibrium distribution coefficients obtained by thermodynamic calculation including an additional consideration on solute interactions.

TI THE HOT-CORROSION BEHAVIOR OF NOVEL CO-DEPOSITED CHROMIUM-MODIFIED
   ALUMINIDE COATINGS
SO OXIDATION OF METALS
AB This paper reports the successful co-deposition of inclusion-free chromium-modified aluminide coatings using a pack-cementation process. The substrate used was the nickel-base superalloy, Rene 80H. The coatings were of the outward-diffusion type; however, unlike the usual outward-diffusion coatings, the present coatings were relatively free of pack inclusions. The coatings consisted of alpha-Cr precipitates in a matrix of beta-NiAl. The morphology and distribution of the alpha- Cr precipitates could be adjusted to the extent that two types of coating structures could be obtained. The Type I coating structure contained lamellar alpha- Cr precipitates situated in the surface region of the coating, whereas the Type II coating structure contained small, spheroidal alpha-Cr precipitates distributed throughout the outer of a two-layered coating. Both coating types exhibited significantly improved hot-corrosion resistance in a 0.1% SO2-O2 environment at 900-degrees-C compared to a commercial aluminide coalting. A study of the corrosion behavior of Type I coatings containing pack inclusions showed that the inclusions were deleterious to the corrosion resistance of the coatings. The corrosion behavior of chromium-aluminide coatings was dependent on both the distribution and amount of alpha-Cr precipitates in the coating.

AB A new type of compositionally graded thermal barrier coating is being developed for the hot-end components of aero gas turbine engines. An electron beam physical vapour deposition process has been employed to co-deposit MCrAlY and partially stabilised zirconia on superalloy substrates. The compositional profile, across the thickness of the coating, is designed by an in-house computer program. The program takes into account the physical properties of the substrate and coating materials, as well as the most important performance requirements. The resulting graded coating is therefore tailored to match the properties of the substrate at the coating-substrate interface and those of the external environment at its outer surface. One advantage of such coatings is that problems associated with interfaces in conventional multi-layered coatings are eliminated. Fabricated coatings were subjected to a number of tests and characterisation studies, including thermal cycling and thermal shock tests, and microanalyses. Effects of process parameters such as substrate temperature and ion-assisted deposition on the microstructure and properties of the coatings, in particular their thermal stability, were investigated. It was found that the thermal stability of the coatings largely depends on their density and microstructure, and that by controlling the density across the thickness a corrosion resistant and strain tolerant coating can be produced.

AB The subject of the investigations was a superalloy with the following chemical composition: 0.14 wt.% C, 10.2 wt.% Cr, 5.3 wt.% Al, 2.8 wt.% Ti, 3.7 wt.% Mo, 5.2 wt.% W, 4.7 wt.% Co, 1.5 wt.% Fe and the balance nickel. A pack cementation technique of coating was applied. Acoustic emission signals were recorded as a function of specimen elongation (SIGMAN-epsilon). The values of elongation (epsilon0) at the moment of the first crack appearance and at the beginning of rapid fracture were measured.
   The crack resistances of the aluminide, silicoaluminide and chromoaluminide diffusion coatings were the main subject of the studies performed. If we take the co parameter as a crack resistance criterion it was found that, when compared with the aluminide coatings, Al-Si and Al-Cr coatings are less resistant. The crack morphologies of aluminium and Al-Cr coatings were similar in character. Among the typical features were cracks that did not spread through the entire layer thickness and discontinuous cracks with branches. In the depleted zone of the coatings, cracks developed along the NiAl phase grain boundaries.

The results are correctly encompassed by the relation s is similar to sigma0T(T + T(d))-1, representing a stochastic process of "slip nucleation and dynamic glide", the latter occurring by percolation of dislocations through accessible zones of the glide planes. T outside the bracket refers to the temperature dependence of the nucleation rate, and (T + T(d))-1 to the post-nucleation slip distance. Its length is assumed to be limited by the frictional resistance to the movement of the dislocations, due to phonon scattering (T inside the bracket), and that arising from forest dislocations, solute atoms, etc. (T(d)). The theory facilitates derivation of the hitherto empirical "stress-concentration factor" used in descriptions of the low-temperature flow-stress anomaly, which is manifest also in the present materials, and provides a clear indication of its origin.

AB This contribution discusses the results of an analytical electron microscopy study of precipitates and insolubles in the Ni-Fe-based superalloy Incoloy 903. The large insolubles in the alloy are observed to be carbides and/or carbonitrides of niobium and titanium. During thermomechanical processing, fine carbides are observed to precipitate on grain boundaries and prior grain boundaries. Also observed to precipitate along the grain boundaries and prior grain boundaries are MN-type (M - Nb, Ti; N = Ni, Co, Fe) phosphides, a phase rich in niobium. The relative proportion of carbides to phosphides is observed to increase with an increase in the final solution treatment temperature, with complete phosphide dissolution at 975-degrees-C/1 h. The phosphides are observed to have an orthorhombic crystal structure with cell dimensions a = 5.99 angstrom, b = 3.35 angstrom and c = 7.06 angstrom. The chemical composition of the coarse carbides, fine carbides and phosphides has been determined. The chemical composition and lattice parameter indicates the phosphides to be based on NbCoP with iron and nickel substituting for some of the cobalt sites.

AB Specimens of investment-cast Mar-M247 superalloy were vacuum-plasma sprayed with Co-29Cr-6Al-1Y bond coat, and part of the specimens were further pre-aluminized at 980-degrees-C for 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 hours.

Results showed that TBC specimens with pre-aluminized bond coatings exhibited lower oxidation rates and significantly higher cyclic life when compared with unaluminized specimens. The failure of bond-coat pre-aluminized TBC specimens was observed to propagate mainly along the lamellar splats of the top coat, whereas the failure of conventional TBC specimens occurred mainly along the top-coat/spinel oxides interface.

SO ACTA METALLURGICA ET MATERIALIA
AB A nickelbase superalloy Nimonic PE16 shows softening when subjected to low cycle fatigue (LCF) at room temperature. Controversy exists in literature over the mechanisms of such softening observed in many precipitation hardened alloys. Small angle neutron scattering (SANS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) have been used to study the morphology of gamma'-precipitates in the Nimonic PE16 after LCF at room temperature. In TEM dark field images using superlattice reflections, deformation bands free of gamma'-precipitates are observed. SANS measurements allowed the characterization of the disappeared precipitates with regard to their average size, size distribution and volume fraction by comparing the scattered intensities of loaded and unloaded specimens. An analysis of the results shows that the gamma'-precipitates within the deformation bands have completely dissolved and not just disordered or cut to sizes smaller than the TEM resolution limit.

Calculations of hypothetical nominal compositions for the alloy, using measured compositions of gamma' phase and matrix as a function of the volume fraction of gamma' phase, allow determination of the volume fraction of gamma' phase at the minimum error between nominal composition and hypothetical nominal composition.  After single-stage annealing, the gamma' concentrations of W, Al, and Co are higher, and those of Cr, Ta, Ti, and Ni are lower near the phase boundary compared to the average concentration of a precipitate.  These concentration gradients and the integral concentrations of element in the gamma' phase are interpreted by the temperature-dependent solubility of elements in the gamma' phase.

   FABRICATED BY RHEOCASTING
SO JOURNAL OF THE JAPAN INSTITUTE OF METALS
AB An investigation was made on the effct of stirring on the microstructures, distribution of solute elements, carbide formation, phosphorus segregation and distribution coefficients between solid and liquid phases in the the Ni-base Superalloy TMP-3 (Ni-11.15%Cr-6.74%Co-3.12%Mo-3.98%Al-2.74%Ti-3.93%Nb-3.25%W) by rheocasting with the rotation of a stirrer at a speed in the range of 20 to 70 rev/s. The main results obtained are summarized as follows:
   (1) When the TMP-3 superalloy was sufficiently agitated at 70 s-1 from the start of solidification, the dendrite structure was broken up and equiaxed grain structure with the average primary solid particle size of 65 +/- 15-mu-m was formed.
   (2) The distributions of Ni, Cr, Co, Al, Ti, Mo, Nb, W, P and C in the superalloy TMP-3 ingots rheocast at 70 s-1 and stationarily cast were measured by using a computer-aided microanalyzer (CMA). The concentrations of main eight metallic elements in the center of equiaxed grains in the rheocast alloy were almost equal to those in the center of dendrites in the stationary cast alloy.
   (3) It was observed from the measurement of the distribution of Ti and Al that the size of gamma' phases in the rheocast alloy tend to decrease as compared with that in the stationarily cast one.
   (4) It was observed that granular MC carbides containing mainly Nb, Ti and Mo precipitate uniformly along the grain boundary in the rheocast alloy, although the plate-like MC carbides precipitate in the grain boundary of the stationary cast alloy.
   (5) The distribution of P measured by CMA showed that P segregates considerably in the grain boundary, but the degree of phosphorous segregation in the rheocast alloy tend to decrease as compared with that in the stationary cast one.
   (6) The solid-liquid distribution coefficients estimated from the concentration of main eight elements in the center of primaly crystals were almost consistent with the equilibrium distribution coefficients obtained by thermodynamic calculation including an additional consideration on solute interactions.

TI HREM STUDY OF THE MATRIX-PRECIPITATE INTERFACE STRUCTURE AND DEFORMATION
   MECHANISMS IN A COBALT BASED SUPERALLOY
SO JOURNAL DE PHYSIQUE III
AB The structure of a Co-Ni-Cr-Nb superalloy has been studied using high resolution electron microscopy.  An ordered hexagonal phase precipitates during annealing at temperatures from 700 to 850-degrees-C.  The compact planes and compact directions of the fcc matrix and precipitates are mutually parallel.  The matrix precipitate interface is constituted by 3 sets of edge dislocations in a triangular distribution.  The dislocation strain field has been calculated using the formalism of the Somigliana dislocations.  Traction experiments were performed at room temperature and deformed samples were observed using HREM.  The deformation mechanisms and gliding dislocations have been identified.

TI SULFIDATION BEHAVIOR OF AL-MODIFIED MP35N ALLOYS
SO OXIDATION OF METALS
AB A commercial superalloy, MP35N, which was modified by adding various amounts of Al up to 10 wt.%, has been studied over the temperature range of 600-900-degrees-C in 0.01 atm sulfur vapor.  The Al-modified alloys contained a second phase whose amount increased with increasing Al.  The sulfidation rate followed the parabolic rate law and decreased with increasing Al content.  An activation energy of 46 kcal/mol was obtained for MP35N, MP35N-5Al, and MP35N-7Al, while a value of 56 kcal/mol was found for MP35N-10Al at 700-800-degrees-C.  Triplex sulfide scales formed on MP35N, consisting of an outer layer of solid solution (Co, Ni)3S4, an intermediate layer of Cr2S3, and a complex, heterophasic inner layer of mostly MoS2.  The Al-modified alloys also formed an outer scale of (Co, Ni)3S4, and an inner layer containing a mixture of CoCr2S4 and Al2S3.  An internal-sulfidation zone containing an Al-rich sulfide was formed in the subtrate.  Only a moderate beneficial effect of Al additions to MP35N was observed at 600-degrees-C.  The observation of the location of platinum markers suggests that cobalt, nickel, chromium, and aluminum diffuse outward to form the major part of scale, and sulfur diffuses inward to produce an internal-sulfidation zone.  Transport processes in the internal-sulfidation zone governed the sulfidation rate of the alloys.

TI DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW NI-BASE SUPERALLOY FOR INDUSTRIAL GAS-TURBINE
   COMBUSTOR BY STATISTICAL ALLOY DESIGN METHOD
SO TETSU TO HAGANE-JOURNAL OF THE IRON AND STEEL INSTITUTE OF JAPAN
AB A new Ni-base superalloy has been developed for gas turbine combustor.  In the first stage, multiple regression analysis was conducted on the published material data of superalloys.  The eatimation equations were established to estimate the mechanical properties such as stress rupture strength and tensile properties, and physical properties such as density and thermal conductivity.  Alloy design program by statistical method was made to select the alloy chemical compositions which will satisfy the requirements of structural design.  By means of this alloy design method, 22%Cr-8%Co-9%Mo-3%W-1%Al-0.3%Ti-Ni base alloy (%:mass%) was set up for combustor superalloy.  The superalloy plates using these alloy elements were manufactured by vacuum induction and remelting process weighing 2000 kg.
   The mechanical and physical properties were examined on those plates, and it is confirmed that these estimated values by alloy design coincide with the testing measured values.  As above test results, it is considered that the statistical alloy design is useful for developing new superalloys.  The new Ni-base superalloy also has good workability, good mechanical and physical properties for industrial gas turbine combustor.
