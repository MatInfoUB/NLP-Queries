AB [001] oriented DD6 alloy was prepared by directional solidification in
   this experiment. ?? phase precipitation phase structure of different
   morphology and size was obtained by different high temperature ageing
   heat treatment processes. Through this experiment, the feasibility of
   improving high temperature performance by adjusting the heat treatment
   process to change the microstructure of the single crystal was explored.
   The as-cast DD6 is first subjected to standard heat treatment(SHT). The
   single crystal sample after the standard heat treatment was further kept
   at 900 C?1300 C for 10 min, 30 min and 1 h, finally air-cooled
   respectively. Heat treatment process of DD6 was simulated using Jmatpro
   software. The individual phase transition temperatures of the alloy were
   determined by DSC experiments. And the size and volume fraction of
   precipitated phase of the alloy were estimated using Image-Pro Plus
   software. It is concluded that the microstructure of the alloy obtained
   after holding at 1100 C for 30 min after standard heat treatment has the
   most uniform microstructure distribution.

   Ni-based single-crystal superalloy had severe solidification segregation
   in the as-cast state, and a large amount of eutectic existed in the
   inter-dendritic region. To determine the heat-treatment window, the

   (75%MCrAlY:25%YSZ, 50%MCrAlY:50%YSZ, and 25%MCrAlY:75%YSZ) were prepared
   by mechanical alloying and subsequently plasma sprayed in a single

   Vanadium pentoxide and Sodium sulfate salts in a ratio of 55 to 45 wt%
   at 1050 degrees C in an atmospheric electrical furnace for 40 h. In
   spite of the fact that the corrosion mechanism was similar in all
   coatings and the amount of the phase transformation of ZrO2 from
   monoclinic to tetragonal was higher in these coatings, functionally
   graded nanocoatings had better resistance to corrosive salts. This
   feature can be attributed to the presence of highly porous nanozones
   which can improve strain tolerance ability. Moreover, the adhesion
   strength of the nanostructured functionally graded coating was higher
   than that of its conventional counterpart. The same trend was also
   observed in two-layer conventional and nano coatings.

   behaviour of coating a long term investigation was carried out at 650

   term heat treatment (i.e. 650 ;C/ 3000 h) on various characteristics of
   the detonation gun sprayed 75Cr(3)C(2)-25NiCr coating. Hardness and
   nanoindentation studies were carried out on Cr3C2-NiCr coating after
   fixed time intervals. The morphological and microstructural features of
   the coated surface were characterized using scanning electron microscope
   (SEM). The phases formed during the long term exposure were identified
   by x-ray diffraction (XRD) technique. The coating showed the presence of
   various Cr, Ni, based oxides, Fe and Ni based spinels. Vanadium,
   niobium, and molybdenum showed maximum tendency to diffusion from
   substrate to the coating. Hardness of the coating reached a maximum
   value of 870 HV after 2160 h of exposure. The hardness of coating
   observed an initial drop in hardness due to carbide coarsening which was
   recovered by precipitation of carbides from the solid solution.

   difficulties involved in the manufacturing of components used with
   turbine engines. The commercially available alloy Incone1718 is

   and experiments the effect of heat treatment process, using a
   combination of solutionizing at 1100 degrees C (2h) and aging at 845
   degrees C for 24h, followed by air cooling. The metallurgical changes
   were observed with the help of optical imaging, to perceive the
   phase/structural transformation. Further, the heat treated samples were
   subjected to electrochemical polarization studies with 1.0 M H2SO4 as an
   electrolyte. The influence of alloying elements, before and after the
   heat treatment process of samples were analysed through scanning
   electron microscope and energy dispersive spectroscopy. The experimental
   results prove that, corrosion resistance was found to be much better
   while following the sequence of DMLS HT > Bare DMLS > Bare Commercial >
   Commercial HT alloy. However, the heat treated DMLS sample obtained
   during experimentation had lower current density and more positive

AB Influence of pre-weld heat treatment on the microstructure and
   mechanical properties of electron beam welded IN738LC superalloy was
   investigated systematically. The microstructure of as-cast base metal
   (BM) mainly consisted of "ogdoadically" diced cube gamma' particles,
   fanlike gamma-gamma' eutectics, MC carbides, Cr-Mo borides and Ni-Zr
   intermetallics. Grain-boundary liquation cracking was observed in the
   HAZ of as-cast joint, resulting from the segregation of elemental boron.
   Pre-weld heat treatment had a significant influence on the size, volume
   fraction and distribution of gamma' particles. It also decreased the
   non-equilibrium segregation of boron during cooling, which inhibited the
   formation of grain-boundary liquid film and liquation cracking. The
   precipitation of MC carbides and nanoscaled gamma' particles in the
   fusion zone (FZ) improved the micro-hardness of the FZ. The
   micro-hardness of the BM and the HAZ were influenced by the volume
   fraction and the size of gamma' particles. All the joints fractured in
   the BM at RM and 900 degrees C. The as-cast and water quenched (WQ)
   joints failed with a quasi-cleavage fracture mode at RM and 900 degrees
   C while the tensile fracture of furnace cooled (FC) joint showed a
   ductile rupture at RM and 900 degrees C.

AB A newly developed third generation nickel-based powder metallurgy (PM)
   superalloy, designated as FGH100L, was produced through Selective Laser
   Melting (SLM). Post-treatments, including Heat Treatment (HT), Hot
   Isostatic Pressing (HIP) and combined HIP + HT treatment, were carried
   out on the as-SLMed alloy to improve its mechanical properties by
   controlling the microstructure and/or reducing the defects in the alloy.
   Both HT and HIP treatments facilitated the recovery and
   recrystallization of the superalloy, especially when the solution
   temperature reached 1150 degrees C, thereby homogenizing the
   microstructure and refining the grains. During the post-treatment, the
   number density of-gamma' precipitates increased obviously with the
   process varying from SLM, SLM + HIP, SLM + HT to SLM + HIP + HT, and
   both yield strength and ultimate strength increased accordingly,
   indicating that the precipitation strengthening played a major role in
   improving the alloy strength. During the HIP process, the size and
   quantity of the pores were greatly reduced, which contributed greatly to
   a much higher elongation of the SLM + HIP alloy than that of the SLM and
   SLM + HT alloys. The fracture surfaces of the SLM alloys after different
   post-treatments showed transgranular fracture features, while the
   intergranular fracture was the main fracture mode of the as SLM alloy.

   to evaluate the service stability of superalloys. In this work,
   precipitation and growth mechanisms of gamma ' phase in different areas
   of a newly designed Ni3Al-based superalloy were investigated under
   short-term thermal exposure conditions. Results showed that twinning
   gamma ' phase and foliated gamma ' phase precipitated in eutectic area
   and interface area, respectively. gamma ' phase went through from sphere
   to precursor plate and plate twinning eventually in eutectic area, which
   was related to preferred orientation of gamma ' phase and local
   segregation of Al element. Dislocation and sidestep interface between
   matrix and the precipitation were the main reasons for the formation of
   twinning gamma ' phase. Meanwhile, the morphology of gamma ' phases in
   interface area went through a process from sphere to rod-like, and
   foliated gamma ' phases formed eventually which grew toward eutectic
   areas with thermal exposure time increasing. Vacancies, distortions
   caused by different thermal expansion coefficients, lattice mismatch
   between dual-phase area and eutectic area contributed to the formation
   and growth of spherical phase. Moreover, reduction in interface energy
   promoted the transformation of spherical phase to rod-like and foliated
   gamma ' phases. In addition, concentration gradient of Al element and
   adequate holding time were responsible for the directional growth of
   foliated gamma ' phase.

   analysis, the average thickness of the coatings created by Ala, Alb and
   Alc powders in the pack aluminizing process was measured to be 92.4,
   89.6, 56.4 mu m, respectively. It was found that the thickness of
   aluminide coatings after the first step of LTHA process is directly
   influenced by the aluminum and nickel concentration gradient between the
   top and bottom of the coatings. The linear atomic distribution of Al,
   Ni, Cr, and Ti elements was compared throughout the coatings. According
   to the results, the coating produced by Alb had the highest Al
   concentration in its composition which shows the higher rate of AlCln
   production and deposition on the surface of the coating. The optimized
   aluminum to the alumina ratio can lead to enhancing gas-state diffusion
   due to inhibiting the local melting and sintering of Al particles.

   cycles of heating to 700 degrees C with a speed of 2 degrees C s(-1)
   followed by water quenching were operated to simulate the temperature

   after cycles of heating and water quenching were characterized by means
   of optical microscopy (OM), x-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive
   spectrometer (EDS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results
   indicated that, after ten cycles of heating and water quenching, the
   major precipitates of JLCo32 were carbides and there were more gamma ''
   phases in CHN327. The mechanical properties of the surfacing layer were
   investigated by microhardness tests and shear tests. High-temperature
   tensile tests at different temperatures were performed to examine the
   high-temperature behaviour of these two kinds of superalloy.
   Experimental results showed that, compared with CHN327, JLCo32 exhibits
   higher microhardness and more reliable bonding with ferrous alloy
   matrix. For the two superalloys, microhardness near the welding line
   tend to increase after cycles of heating and water quenching attributed
   to the diffusion of strengthening elements. Furthermore, in comparison
   to CHN327, JLCo32 own superior yield strength and ultimate tensile

AB Crack defects of material during hot forging processes cannot be
   accurately predicted using the current finite element (FE) codes. One of
   the main reasons for this is that mechanisms of material damage in hot
   metal forming processes are dependent on temperature and strain rate.
   Heavy backup rollers are a key part of rolling production lines. To
   effectively predict internal fracture of heavy backup rollers in hot
   forming processes, an elevated temperature damage model based on
   Cockcroft-Latham criterion was proposed to account the influence of
   elevated temperature and strain rate. Tensile tests of 45Cr4NiMoV steel
   for heavy backup rollers were implemented by a Gleeble-1500D
   thermal-mechanical simulator from 700 degrees C to 1150 degrees C and at
   three strain rates (0.01 s(-1), 0.1 s(-1), 1 s(-1)); this led to
   identification of material parameters of the proposed damage model.
   Finally, the developed damage model was integrated into commercial FE
   code FORGE, As well as the simulations of tensile tests at elevated
   temperature were conducted to validate its accuracy. The results show
   that the new damage model is able to predict crack defects in hot

   on the stress-controlled TMF experiments at different stress/temperature
   ranges, dwell times and phase angles. The fractographic observations
   revealed a creep-fatigue failure mechanism for in-phase thermomechanical
   fatigue (IP TMF) and an oxidation-fatigue failure mechanism for
   out-of-phase thermomechanical fatigue (OP TMF). According to the
   observed physical phenomenon of the slip along particular planes during
   the deformation process, selecting the steady-ratcheting shear-strain
   rate as the representative physical quantity, a new critical-plane-based
   lifetime prediction model which was suitable for a variety of experiment
   conditions was established. The predicted lifetimes for both standard
   specimens and turbine blades showed good agreements with the
   experimental data. The strong versatility and the concise mathematic
   form that made the model have some practical application value.

   tensile tests in a temperature range of 1070-1220 degrees C and hot
   compression tests in a temperature range of 1130-1190 degrees C,
   respectively. The accuracy of the models is verified using the finite

   perfect upsetting window in the aim of no cracks, high fraction of DRX
   and fine DRX grains for homogenized U720Li during the upsetting process.

AB Texture control is a major challenge in laser-assisted additive
   manufacturing of metal part due to the focused heat source and rapid
   cooling. In this study, a novel magnetic-field-assisted laser additive
   manufacturing method is proposed to obtain highly oriented texture.
   Inconel 718 samples are deposited under a transverse magnetic field of
   various intensities and different levels of laser power. The elemental
   distribution, grain morphology, and texture of as-built material are
   carefully analyzed using various material characterization techniques,
   including, SEM, EDS, and EBSD. The results indicate that the magnetic
   field changes the interdendritic microsegregation pattern from a
   continuous chain to discrete morphology. The <110> direction of
   deposited material tends to align with the transverse magnetic field.
   The orientation of stray crystals is more strictly constrained by both
   vertical heat flux and transverse magnetic field, resulting in a highly
   oriented <100> texture on horizontal cross-section and <110> texture on
   the vertical cross-section. It is also observed that by applying the
   transverse magnetic field, the average grain boundary misorientation
   angle significantly decreases from 32 degrees to 19 degrees, and the
   maximum multiple of uniform density increases from 3.0 to 5.3. The
   effects of laser power as well as magnetic field strength are
   investigated, and the underlying orientation effect is discussed.

AB High-temperature corrosion of the nickel based superalloy 617 OCC
   (Optimised Chemical Composition) was studied in the context of proposed
   application in ultra-supercritical (USC) power plants. Studies were
   carried out in USC power plant environment simulated in the laboratory.
   Simulation was performed by coating the alloy with a salt mixture
   consisting of K2SO4, Na2SO4, Fe2O3, SiO2 and Al2O3 and exposing it to a
   flowing gas mixture comprising of 15% CO2, 3.5% O-2, 0.25% SO2 and the
   rest N-2 (Vol%) at 700 degrees C. For the sake of comparison, corrosion
   studies were also carried out under the same conditions, but without the
   gas mixture. Progress of corrosion was monitored by thermogravimetry,
   XRD and cross sectional studies on corroded specimens using SEM/EDAX
   analysis. There was evidence for both external and internal sulfidation
   with the flowing gas mixture, suggesting that the SO2 present in the gas
   mixture plays a dominant role. Chromium present in the alloy reacted
   with the sulfur-containing species in the environment forming chromium
   sulfide. No internal oxidation of aluminum and titanium was observed in
   the presence of flowing gas mixture. Internal oxidation was observed, in
   contrast, without flowing gas mixture at longer exposure times. The
   paper discusses the findings and possible corrosion mechanisms, coming
   into play.

AB Heavy duty (HD) vehicles are projected to be the largest fuel-use
   subsector in transportation, with current demand for diesel fuel
   projected to grow 30% by 2040. Historically, a primary strategy for
   increasing diesel engine efficiency has been to increase peak cylinder
   pressure (PCP). However, increasing PCP imparts greater mechanical and
   thermal loads on engine components and materials. In recent years, the
   material property limits for many components have been reached and
   further increases in PCP above similar to 20 MPa have been difficult,
   while still maintaining the necessary affordability and longevity of
   on-road HD diesel engines. This paper reviews the historical evolution
   and major metallurgical advancements of high temperature materials in HD
   on road diesel engines (10-15 L displacement) up to the current state of
   the art, focusing on materials in the engine block, cylinder heads,
   pistons, valves, and exhaust components. These components cover a wide
   range of material classes, including cast iron, ferritic steel,
   austenitic steel, titanium alloys, nickel based super-alloys, and high
   temperature coatings. The micro structural degradation and failure
   mechanisms of the materials associated with the complex mechanical and
   thermal loading during service are discussed and key areas for future
   materials research are suggested that overcome technical barriers.

AB The precipitation and dissolution behaviors of delta phase inside a

   investigated. A new method for quantitatively evaluating the content of
   delta phase was proposed based on SEM micrograph, which was verified by
   X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. The effects of recrystallization
   during pre-annealing at 980 degrees C on the precipitation and
   dissolution behaviors of delta phase in the subsequent annealing
   treatment at 900 degrees C and 980 degrees C are discussed. Moreover,
   the improved precipitation and dissolution kinetics models are proposed
   to consider the effects of recrystallization fraction. The results show
   that: (1) for the precipitation of delta phase at 900 degrees C, delta
   phases precipitate first in grain boundaries and then within grains
   after a long incubation period. Moreover, the interval between adjacent
   delta phases increases first and then drops with the increasing
   recrystallization fraction during pre-annealing treatment. A balance
   between the precipitation and solution of delta phase at the aging
   temperature of 900 degrees C can be reached when the holding time is
   about 12 h; (2) for the dissolution of delta phase at 980 degrees C, the
   dissolution equilibrium can be obtained at approximate 200 min.
   Moreover, more rod-like delta phases can be remained with the increasing
   recrystallization fraction in pre-annealing treatment.

AB Laves phase segregation is a universal phenomenon in additive
   manufactured or as-cast Inconel 718 alloy, and the Laves phase usually
   degrades the mechanical properties of the matrix. In this work,
   nickel-based alloys designed with different Nb contents were
   successfully fabricated by laser metal deposition (LMD) via a dual-feed
   system, and the Laves phase distribution at the macro level was
   relatively uniform. The effects of Nb content on the microstructure,
   mechanical properties and surface potential of the as-received and
   heat-treated nickel-based alloys were investigated. The grain size of
   the as-received LMD nickel-based alloys decreased with the Nb content,
   and the Laves phase exhibited a universally higher nano-hardness but
   lower surface potential than the gamma matrix. The nano-hardness of the
   Laves phase linearly increased, whereas the Volta potential decreased
   with the Nb content. The strength improvement for the as-received LMD
   nickel-based alloys with different Nb contents was equally attributed to
   grain refinement and enhancement of the Laves phase (both hardness and
   content), while the increase in the precipitate content (main gamma '')
   as a function of Nb content contributed to the substantial improvement
   in hardness for the heat-treated LMD nickel-based alloys and the grain
   refinement strengthening effect was comparative minor after aging
   treatment. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.

   microstructure variation were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD),
   scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscope
   (TEM). It was found that the oxidation kinetics of un-irradiated and
   irradiated samples obeyed a parabolic law. The oxidation rate was lower
   in the sample with higher dose irradiation. The oxide layer was
   comprised of outer oxide scale (mainly Cr2O3) and inner oxide layer
   (mainly Al2O3 and TiO2). Irradiation raised the surface layer's energy
   and facilitated the nucleation of fine oxide particles. While fine oxide
   particles improved the densification of outer oxide scale. Due to the
   irradiation-induced defects, fast-diffusion paths were provided for Cr
   to the surface. This accelerated the forming of dense outer Cr2O3 oxide
   scale, and restricted the inward penetration of O. Therefore, the
   thickness of oxide layer especially the inner oxide layer significantly
   decreased. The enhanced oxidation resistance of irradiated samples was
   essentially attributed to the combination of improved surface layer's
   energy and irradiation defects.

AB The microstructure evolution and strengthening mechanism of a

   solid forming (LSF) were clarified by an investigation of the LSFed
   IN-738LC alloy with different solution treatments (at 1070 degrees C,
   1120 degrees C and 1160 degrees C). The results show that both the
   as-deposited and heat-treated deposits were dominated by the columnar
   grains with a width of 100-270 mu m. The equiaxed grains mainly
   originated from the columnar-to-equiaxed transition (CET) during LSF
   while a small portion of the equiaxed grains originated from
   recrystallization during the heat treatment, due to the relatively low
   temperature gradient in the induction-assisted LSF. Fine grain
   strengthening was still working in the columnar-grains dominated LSFed
   IN-738LC deposits. However, gamma' strengthening was found to play a
   major role in the strengthening mechanism by comparing the
   microstructure and properties of different heat-treated deposits. The
   gamma' dissolution and coarsening kinetics were calculated and the
   interaction mechanism between the dislocation and gamma' phase in LSFed
   IN-738LC was clarified. The deformation of the coarse (d > 200 nm) near
   cubic gamma' was found to be beneficial to the increase of ultimate
   tensile strength (UTS) and elongation (EL), while a brittle continuous
   phase formed at the grain boundary (GB) which was rich in Ni, Cr, Al and
   Ti was found to be detrimental to the deposit's plasticity. The gamma'
   phase deformation and desquamating, carbide breaking and GB phase
   breaking are the predominant fracture failure mechanisms. On the basis
   of relatively high strength, the IN-738LC deposits with a lower yield

   By using neutron diffraction and 2D-detector X-ray diffraction, the
   through-thickness residual stress distribution was determined in
   fabricated turbine discs via isothermal forging, solution treatment and
   aging treatment. The experimental results demonstrated that residual
   stress exhibited typical thermal stress distribution while plastic
   deformation-induced surface stress was relieved surprisingly after
   solution treatment. After aging treatment, the reduction of matrix
   supersaturation after long-time diffusion contributed to increase of
   compressive radial stress in the rim of disc. By introducing
   temperature-dependent supplementary phase transformation latent heat
   into the thermo-mechanical model, overall residual stress distribution
   after solution treatment was simulated by the finite element method.
   Numerical simulated stress distribution is in agreement with the
   experimental results, with the deviation < 40 MPa. (C) 2019 The Authors.

   mapped. In addition, analytical equations, taking into account various
   laser processing parameters, material properties and support geometries,
   were developed to calculate the heat build-up and cooling conditions
   during L-PBF. The results of microstructure characterization and
   analytical calculation showed a marginal effect of the support on the
   local microstructure and hardness due to the low heat input in L-PBF.
   Moreover, the comprehensive set of microstructure data is useful for
   future work of modelling processing-microstructure relation as well as
   optimizing post-fabrication heat treatment.

AB Fatigue crack propagation tests under both isothermal and non-isothermal
   thermomechanical fatigue conditions have been performed on wrought
   Haynes 230, a ductile combustor material. A number of specimens were
   thermally aged by pre-straining and subsequent furnace exposure for 3000
   h at 600 degrees C. The tests were performed both under load and strain
   control, between room temperature and 600 degrees C. The thermally aged
   notched specimens show a decrease in the crack initiation life, similar
   to results previously reported for smooth test specimens at room
   temperature. For the crack growth rates, the effects of thermal ageing
   were less pronounced than for crack initiation. Further, the tests have
   been simulated using the finite element method to calculate the crack
   driving force, where the plasticity induced crack closure is handled
   with a full history description. A temperature dependent linear
   kinematic hardening plasticity law has been adopted for describing the
   material behaviour between room temperature and 600 degrees C. A
   post-processing tool was used in which the plasticity induced crack
   opening level was calculated, followed by a calculation of the effective
   Delta J range for each crack length. The adopted procedure yields good
   correlation between the different tests, under both isothermal and
   non-isothermal conditions.

AB This paper systematically evaluated the effect of oxide, wire source and
   heat treatment on the mechanical properties of wire + arc additively
   manufactured (WAAM) INCONEL 718. Comparison of the as deposited grain
   structure was made with laser-powder based AM and wrought INCONEL 718.
   Results showed that oxides formed during deposition had no effect on the
   mechanical properties since a 0.5 mu m thick passivation layer
   consisting of Cr2O3 and Al2O3 formed upon deposition and prevented
   further oxides from forming inside the bulk. Wires from different
   suppliers resulted in around 50 MPa difference in UTS possibly due to
   the slight compositional variation and uncertainties in TiN inclusion.
   Standard heat treatment improved the strength from 824 MPa to 1110 MPa
   in the horizontal direction, but the average strength was 105 MPa lower
   than the wrought alloy. The as deposited WAAM INCONEL718 featured large
   columnar grains and numerous Laves phase, as compared to the fine grains
   of laser powder bed fusion and wrought INCONEL 718. This starting
   microstructure led to less favourable and less numerous precipitates
   forming during heat treatment, which is the main reason for the strength
   mismatch. A different heat treatment would not help due to the starting
   microstructure.

   the same nominal composition as the superalloy substrate. Subsequently,
   a second layer was deposited using a target with a composition of 70
   at.% Al and 30 at.% Cr, and the deposition was conducted in flowing
   oxygen to form Al-Cr-O. The thermal stability of the layer stack was
   investigated by means of a heat treatment at 1100 degrees C in air. The
   substrate-like coating recrystallized at elevated temperature and showed
   epitaxial growth on the superalloy single crystal, according to
   transmission Kikuchi diffraction measurements. A thin layer of pure
   alpha-alumina formed on top of the substrate-like coating and a compact
   Al-Cr-O phase with corundum structure developed towards the top of the
   coating. Microstructural and chemical analyses of the coating
   architectures in the as deposited and annealed states were performed by
   means of transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray
   spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and Rutherford backscattering
   spectrometry, and utilized to explain the recrystallization and
   diffusion processes in the layer stack.

AB The influences of solution cooling on the microstructures, mechanical

   resistance are greatly influenced by the solution cooling methods
   including furnace-cooling (FC), water-cooling (WC) and air-cooling (AC).
   For the FC superalloy, large amount of coarse gamma '' (Ni3Nb) and
   gamma' (Ni3Al) phases precipitate from the matrix, and delta (Ni3Nb)
   phase preferentially precipitates on grain boundaries. Besides, compared
   with the WC and AC superalloys, the ultimate tensile strength, yield
   strength and micro-hardness of the FC superalloy are higher, but the
   elongation to fracture is lower. Additionally, the hot corrosion
   behavior can be well described by the sulfidation-oxidation model and
   the alkaline-base melting model. Furthermore, the FC superalloy has the
   best hot corrosion resistance among the three solution cooled

AB According to the gradual changes of the microstructure of superalloys
   during harsh service condition of turbine blades and the detrimental
   effects of these changes on the mechanical properties of superalloys,
   performing of a rejuvenation heat treatment (solution treatment + aging
   process) on ex-serviced superalloys is necessary. In this work, the
   aging heat treatment was conducted on a serviced single crystal ZHS32
   superalloy in the temperature range of 950-1150 degrees C. It was found
   that while performing the aging process at 950 and 1050 degrees C for 10
   h did not provide appropriate conditions for the nucleation and growth
   of primary ? phases, conducting aging at the temperature of 1150 degrees
   C for 10 and 16 h yields to the formation of ? precipitates with the
   desired cuboidal morphology. The comparison of the microstructure of the
   rejuvenated samples with the un-rejuvenated samples confirms that with
   applying this procedure, the size of strengthening ? precipitates
   reduces and the volume fraction of these phases considerably increases,
   which yields to the recovery of the superalloy microstructure and
   improvement of its mechanical properties such as hardness.

AB Effect of Nb on the hot tensile deformation behavior of cast Haynes 25
   Co-Cr-W-Ni alloy was investigated in temperature range of 950-1200
   degrees C. In the base alloy, thermodynamic calculations showed that
   M23C6 and M6C are the stable forms of carbides at temperatures below
   1000 degrees C and over 1050 degrees C, respectively. For Nb-containing
   alloy, however, WC and NbC are observed below 1050 degrees C. At higher
   temperatures, W carbides dissolve and tungsten diffuses into NbC
   particles to form complex carbides. The yield point phenomena (YPP) were
   observed in both alloys at temperatures over 1050 degrees C due to the
   immobilization of matrix dislocations by W, Cr and C. Addition of Nb
   increased the strength and elongation due to the precipitation of NbC
   carbides. Absorbing the solute atoms and favoring dynamic
   recrystallization (DRX) seems to be the possible mechanisms. Loss of hot
   ductility occurred in both alloys at 1050 degrees C. It was attributed
   to the dissolution of carbides into matrix and their negative effects on
   dynamic recovery (DRV) and recrystallization. DRX was the major
   microstructural mechanism at high temperature, e.g. 1150 degrees C. At
   low temperatures, e.g. 950 degrees C, only DRV occurred. (C) 2018

   investigated by various tools, i.e., scanning electron microscope with

   x-ray diffraction analysis and Vickers hardness. Evaluation of
   microstructure shows that the weld zone mainly consists of columnar
   dendrites. The effect of aging heat treatment on the microstructure
   morphology and phase structure is very limited. Also, it was observed
   that there are obvious segregation and precipitates in intracrystalline

   backscatter diffraction results show that the weld zone and base metal
   have a clear difference in the grain boundary characterization and
   kernel average misorientation at room temperature and after aging heat
   treatment, which leads to a difference in microhardness of the weld
   zone. In addition, the relationship between microhardness and tensile

   Diffusion coating was carried out by pack cementation process at 1000
   degrees C for 8h. Cyclic oxidation tests of Nimonic 75 and its coated
   specimens were conducted at 900, 1000 and 1100 degrees C in air for a
   total period of 100h. During the first 30-h period, 5-h cycle was
   applied, and during the 40-100-h period, 10-h cycle was applied. The
   structures of the coated Nimonic 75 alloy before and after
   high-temperature oxidation were investigated using light microscopy,
   scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive spectroscopy and X-ray
   diffraction characterization techniques. The results indicated that
   Zr-doped chromo-aluminide coating is more effective than
   chromo-aluminide coating in increasing the oxidation resistance of
   Nimonic 75 alloy. The parabolic oxidation rate constant k(p) for cyclic
   oxidation of uncoated , Cr-Al-coated and Zr/Cr-Al-coated alloys are 1.7,
   0.77 and 0.61 10(-6)mg(2)cm(-4)s(-1) at 900 degrees C, and 10.08, 5.2

   18.13 10(-6)mg(2)cm(-4)s(-1) at 1100 degrees C. The improvement in
   oxidation resistance by zirconium addition to the chromo-aluminized
   coating is attributed to its effect on achieving better control of
   interdiffusion fluxes occurring between coating and substrate so as to
   reduce Kirkendall effect and voids formation, hence enhancing adhesion,
   in addition to reducing the outward diffusion of aluminum and

AB The interfacial energy between the gamma and gamma ' phase in Ni-Co base
   superalloy TMW-4M3 was investigated using both a kinetic analysis of
   experimental data and a thermodynamic analysis. The coarsening rate of
   gamma' precipitates during the aging treatment process was analyzed
   using extended Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner theory, including the
   contribution of a full diffusion matrix with a thermodynamic
   calculation. The interfacial energies calculated from the coarsening
   kinetics using only the diagonal components were half as large as those
   using the off-diagonal contributions as well. The interfacial energy
   with full diffusion matrix contributions is about 75 mJ/m(2) between
   1373 and 1413 K. In addition, the interfacial energy was also analyzed
   on the basis of the extended Becker's model (EBM), and the results,
   which ranged from 73.9 to 76.3 mJ/m(2 ), showed good agreements with
   those from the coarsening kinetics. A comparison of the interfacial
   energy between TMW-4M3 and several Ni base superalloys indicated an
   identical tendency of higher interfacial energy with a larger Ti/Al
   ratio. The off-diagonal terms of a diffusion matrix are very important
   in analyzing the coarsening kinetics of gamma' and gamma/gamma' the
   interfacial energy estimation using the EBM is a suitable method for

AB Inconel 738 is one of the widely used nickel-based superalloys in
   high-temperature applications, especially in land-based and aerospace
   gas turbine engines. This paper reports the feasibility of direct laser
   metal deposition (LMD) of Inconel 738. Cracks evolved during deposition
   at the substrate/deposit interface and within the deposit along high
   angle grain boundary for scanning speed of 6 and 12 mm/s due to the
   intense residual stress and incipient melting. Results showed liquation
   cracking due to low melting crack boundary gamma' and significant micro
   segregation of Al and Ti along the crack boundaries. By maximizing the
   energy density and by reducing the scanning speed to 3 mm/s, crack-free
   single wall specimens were successfully manufactured. Microstructural
   evolution of primary, secondary, grain boundary gamma', MC carbides, and
   M2B borides in the as-deposited and heat-treat specimens are discussed.
   Mechanical properties and microstructural development were investigated
   using tensile testing and scanning electron microscopy. Energy
   dispersive spectroscopy confirmed significant micro segregation on
   various elements along the interdendritic and grain boundaries. X-ray
   diffraction validated the presence of the observed carbides and boride
   in the as-deposited and heat-treated samples.

AB Long-striped Laves phases are considered to be crack sources in laser
   repaired Inconel 718 during stress rupture test. In order to obtain fine
   Laves phases, Nd:YAG pulse laser is used to fabricate Inconel 718
   superalloy on a wrought Inconel 718 substrate in this study. The
   microstructures and stress rupture properties of pulse laser repaired
   Inconel 718 superalloy after DA treatment (720 degrees C x 8 h/furnace
   cooling at 50 degrees C/h to 620 degrees C x 8 h/air cooling) and 900STA
   treatment (900 degrees C x 20 min/air cooling+720 degrees C x 8
   h/furnace cooling at 50 degrees C/h to 620 degrees C x 8 h/air cooling)
   are investigated by using SEM and TEM. The results shows that granular
   Laves phases can be obtained when pulse laser is used. The formation of
   granular Laves phase is related to high cooling rate (G.R) and low ratio
   of temperature gradient to growth rate (G/R). The critical values of G-R
   and G/R are 10(4) and 10(7), respectively. After 900STA treatment, delta
   phase precipitates around the granular Laves phases. But there is no
   delta phases existing in the DA samples. The surrounding delta phases
   can induce stress concentration, resulting in that the elongation of the
   900STA samples is worse than that of the DA samples. However, the
   regions denuded in Nb element around the delta phases can delay the
   formation of the vacancies, which leads to that the stress rupture life
   of the 900STA samples is better than that of the DA samples. (C) 2018

AB Herein, we demonstrate the creep performance of a turbine disk
   superalloy - FGH1OOL - at 705 degrees C and 897 MPa. The effect of
   solution treatment and cooling rate on the microstructure, fracture and
   creep performance is presented in detail. The microstructure and
   fracture are characterized by optical microscopy (OM), transmission
   electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The
   results reveal that instead of air cooling (AC), after solution
   treatment (ST), the combination of slow and fast cooling improves the
   creep performance of the alloy at 705 degrees C and 897 MPa. Both during
   AC and the combination of slow and fast cooling, followed by ST, the
   creep process is dominated by the accumulation of dislocations and
   stacking faults, cutting through the gamma' phase. The microstructural
   evolution is the main cause of creep acceleration, which mainly
   manifests as coarsening and morphology change of the gamma' phase. Our
   proposed heat treatment scheme generates the serrated grain boundaries,
   which play a vital role in improving the creep performance. In the case
   of AC, the creep pores sprout and develop into wedge-shaped cracks at
   the trigeminal intersection of the grain boundary, while the combination
   of slow and fast cooling results in opening-mode cracks at the grain
   boundary and carbide interface. Both creep ruptures, under two different
   heat treatment processes, are intergranular fractures. (C) 2018 Elsevier

AB Thin sections of Inconel 718 sample was treated with laser-based metal
   deposition using a CW CO2 laser. The Taguchi-based grey relational
   approach was incorporated for determining the optimized process
   characteristics of the laser treatment. Laser scan speed was varied at a
   constant laser power in order to analyze the effect of cooling rate and
   the subsequent thermal gradient on the microstructure and other
   properties of the base alloy. The presence of -(Ni3Al, Ni3Ti) and -Ni3Nb
   precipitates in the interdendritic boundaries was evidenced in the
   deposition zone. The increase in laser scan speed to 600m/min changed
   the microstructure from coarse to fine grains, and a further increase to
   maximum laser power of 1.75kW showed the transformation to still finer
   dendritic structure. Even though the fine dendritic structure, it also
   resulted in delamination of bonding layers which could be deleterious.
   X-ray diffraction spectrum revealed the precipitation of -NiCr, -Ni3Al
   and -Ni3Nb in the -Ni matrix and there was no evidence for the
   transformation of -Ni3Nb to -Ni3Nb. It indicated that the selected laser
   parameter had the least possibility of influence in the formation of
   intermetallics after treatment. The significant effect of grain
   refinement improved the hardness by 15-20%. The tensile test on Inconel
   718 showed the Ni3Nb precipitate particles initiated the interfacial
   failure and was encountered with ductile mode of fracture.

AB The degradation of high-temperature components in the aerospace industry
   becomes a greater concern with the use of higher operating temperatures
   and increased operating cycles. Although the repair of defects can
   extend component lifespans, welding often results in a heat-affected
   zone (HAZ) or fusion zone with reduced mechanical properties. Due to the
   low energy input of electrospark deposition (ESD), repaired components
   shouldbeless susceptible to mechanicalproperty deterioration. ESD of
   alloy 718 on solution-annealed and aged alloy 718 base metal is
   evaluated in the as-deposited and direct-aged condition. HAZ formation
   is measured at 80 mu m on an annealed substrate and 40 mu m on an aged
   substrate. Direct aging of depositions eliminates the heat-affected zone
   and introduces strengthening phases in the deposition that results in a
   hardness equivalent to that of the aged base metal. The yield strength
   of as-deposited and direct-aged alloy 718 depositions is equivalent to
   the annealed and aged base metal, respectively, whereas the ultimate
   strength is, respectively, 16 and 8 pct lower. Decreased ultimate
   strength is attributed to lower fracture toughness of brittle secondary
   phases and splat boundaries from the ESD process that remain after the
   direct aging heat treatment.

AB Selective laser melting (SLM) was used to prepare notched high-cycle
   fatigue test specimens made from nickel-based superalloy Inconel 718.
   Samples were designed to have 1 of 3 different notch geometries,
   including V notches with K-t of 2.2 or 3.1, a U notch with K-t of 2.0,
   and were printed in either vertical or horizontal orientations. Samples
   were tested with as-printed dimensions and surfaces after heat
   treatment, but a separate set of SLM samples were printed as plates and
   machined to final dimensions comporting to the V-notch specimen with K-t
   = 3.1. High-cycle fatigue testing showed that machined SLM specimens
   behaved similar to wrought Inconel 718 plate specimens, but testing with
   as-produced surfaces led to a decrease in fatigue life. The explanation
   for this difference is based on approximations of linear elastic
   fracture mechanics solutions for short cracks emanating from notch
   roots, with intrinsic surface features of SLM materials serving as the
   cracks. Analysis of the actual notch geometries after SLM fabrication
   indicates that stress intensity in the presence of these features plays
   a prominent role in determining number of cycles before fatigue crack
   initiation and propagation occurs.

AB Powder metallurgy (P/M) nickel-based superalloy FGH96 is widely used for
   turbine discs in aero-engines. With an increasing trend towards powder
   metallurgy routes for turbine discs, undesired non-metallic inclusions
   comparable to the grain size are unavoidably introduced during the
   manufacturing process. In this study, a series of strain controlled low
   cycle fatigue (LCF) tests were conducted on the specimens cut from a P/M
   FGH96 turbine disc at elevated temperature. The microscopic mechanisms
   of the effects of the size and inclusion location on LCF lifetime were
   investigated by using scanning electronic microscope (SEM) with energy
   dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) for the fractographic analysis of
   specimens. It is revealed that the P/M FGH96 superalloy is sensitive to
   surface defects, such as surface scratches and surface inclusion; while
   the specimen for which the crack nucleates from internal inclusion
   usually has a longer fatigue lifetime due to smaller stress
   concentration at the crack tip. Moreover, the inclusion involving its
   location and size has a significant influence on the P/M FGH96
   suPeralloy's LCF lifetime. Then, a modified model was proposed to
   quantify the inclusion effect on the LCF lifetime. Finally, a
   probabilistic model based on Bayesian approach was formulated to
   describe the scattering in LCF lifetimes induced by random inclusions.

AB The microstructure and hardness of solid solution heat treated (ST) and

   melting are investigated. The temperature range for the ST is between
   970 and 1250 degrees C, while the two-step precipitation hardening was
   done at 760 and 650 degrees C, each for 10h. The result demonstrates the
   effects of homogenization and consequently the effects of aging on the
   microstructure and hardness of the samples studied. Complete
   recrystallization occurred for the specimens ST at and higher than 1180
   degrees C. The grain structures of ST specimens qualitatively appear
   identical with those specimens ST and aged, implying that aging does not
   induce noticeable changes in the grain structures. Precipitation
   hardening generates uniformly distributed good yield of ellipsoidal
   precipitates with average size of minor and major axis of 11-17nm and
   48-81nm, respectively. In addition, smaller quantities of precipitates
   with an average size of 24nm are observed for the aged specimens.
   Increasing the hold time of ST for a particular temperature leads to
   coarsening of precipitates, which have a negative impact on the hardness
   of the material. After aging, the hardness of the specimens is increased
   by 32-43% relative to that of the as-printed specimen. The increments in
   hardness for the specimens ST at and lower than 1100 degrees C (and
   aged) are the result of the combined effects of hardening precipitates
   and strain associated with the lattice defects, such as dislocation
   networks and subgrain boundaries that remain undissolved. The
   microstructures of the specimens ST at higher temperatures (e.g., 1250
   degrees C) have attained minimal lattice defects due to completed
   recrystallization. Hence, the increment in hardness for these specimens
   after aging is mainly due to the hardening precipitates. Needle-shaped
   phase is also precipitated along/near grain boundaries during solid
   solution heat treatment at 970 degrees C. Formation of phase can consume
   a lot of Nb, which otherwise be used for the precipitation of hardening
   phases.

   structure of the grain boundary on sensitization was assessed through
   double loop electrochemical potentiokinetic reactivation test and
   measured in terms of degree of sensitization (DOS). DOS was found to be
   in a direct relation with the fraction of random high-angle grain
   boundaries and their connectivity, while it was inversely related to the
   fraction of low-sigma coincidence site lattice boundaries and special
   triple junctions. Residual strain and the fraction of low-angle grain

AB Inconel 718, a nickel-based superalloy widely used in the aviation

   method forInconel 718 due to its effective and economical processing
   characteristics. This paper investigates the dissolution effects on
   surface integrity in ECM of Inconel 718. Two types of materials with
   different heat treatments, solid solution, and solution and aging were
   studied to analyze their electrochemical behavior. They have different
   metallographic microstructures and precipitate phases. There are many
   Laves phase (Fe2Nb), delta phase (Ni3Nb), and carbides in material of
   solid solution state, while there are fewer in material of solution and
   aging state. Experiments were then performed on these materials under
   identical ECM conditions. The results show that the surface roughness of
   the solid-solution material was about Ra 1.378 mu m while it was Ra
   0.188 mu m for the solution and aging material. A dissolution model was
   proposed to illustrate the electrochemical behavior of solid solution
   Inconel 718, revealing that the uneven distribution of the
   metallographic phase and the rich content of the element niobium (Nb)
   will influence the surface integrity of the ECMed sample. (c) The

AB The dynamic response and impact resistance of wire-arc additive
   manufactured (AMed) and wrought ATI 718Plus in different heat treatment
   conditions are characterised by using a direct impact Hopkinson pressure
   bar system. In addition, microstructural analyses of the alloys, before
   and after impact, are characterised by using advanced microscopy
   techniques, including scanning electron and transmission electron
   microscopies. The experimental results show that the impact resistance
   of the AMed alloy in the as-processed condition is inferior to that of
   the wrought alloy. The lower impact resistance is attributed to the
   presence of eutectic solidification constituents in the interdendritic
   regions and to the inhomogeneous distribution of the strengthening
   precipitates in the deposit. After the application of the recommended
   heat treatment for ATI 718Plus, excessive formation of eta-phase
   particles are observed in the microstructure in addition to Laves phase
   particles. Since the recommended heat treatment for ATI 718Plus is not
   sufficient to eliminate the deleterious phases and optimise the
   properties of the alloy, a novel heat treatment procedure is proposed.
   Dynamic impact study of the AMed alloy after the application of the
   proposed approach shows that the alloy exhibits a dynamic response and
   impact resistance comparable to those of the wrought alloy. Furthermore,
   under high impact momentum, both the wrought and the AMed alloys fail
   due to the adiabatic shear band. A transmission electron microscopy
   analysis of the deformed alloys suggests the dissolution of the gamma'
   precipitates in the shear band as well as in the adjacent regions to the
   shear band. Increase in the rate of dissolution of the precipitates due
   to strain-assisted diffusion coupled with an increase in the adiabatic
   temperature during deformation, are likely causes of the dissolution of
   the precipitates in the shear band regions.

AB Nickel-based superalloy C263 has been consolidated with Laser Powder Bed
   Fusion (LPBF) with two perpendicular build orientations and exposed to
   either of two heat treatment programmes. This study analyses the effects
   of build orientation and heat treatment on the resulting microstructures
   produced in LPBF C263 variants, evaluated against a cast equivalent.
   Results show that although a strongly anisotropic microstructure was
   present in standard heat-treated (HT1) LPBF material, this was
   eradicated following an alternate heat treatment regime (HT2) through
   recrystallisation, aided by high local strain. Subsequently, their
   mechanical properties have been assessed by means of the Small Punch
   (SP) creep test. A contrasting presence of Sigma 3 formations was
   observed between the two LPBF heat treatment programmes with the
   resulting random grain boundary network (RGBN) revealing shorter
   potential intergranular crack paths in the HT2 material, although grain
   boundary carbides were found to be the dominant strengthening mechanism
   for improved creep resistance. Adapted Wilshire equations have been
   implemented to predict the long-term creep lives of the C263 variants
   and their apparent activation energies have been determined. (C) 2018

AB The influences of EBM processing and post-processing on microstructure,
   mechanical properties and cracking behaviour in gamma'
   precipitation-strengthened nickel-base superalloy DZ125 are critically
   assessed. Results show that a solution treating and ageing (STA) is
   required to obtain gamma' precipitates with a cuboidal shape. The
   columnar grain width was found to gradually increase from the bottom to
   the top of the as-EBM sample having a total build height of 80 mm,
   whereas there was little gradient in gamma' size. The presence of EBM
   induced intergranular cracks can be closed by hot isostatic pressing
   (HIP), however reappearance of intergranular cracks with a much wider
   crack opening width was observed after STA treatment. EBM induced cracks
   are classified as liquid-state cracking, as the classic dendritic
   morphology were found on the cracked surfaces. The post-processing
   induced cracks can be attributed to the effect of gamma' dissolution and
   re-precipitation of fine gamma' during the cooling stage of solution
   treatment. The results suggest that HIP is not an effective approach in
   healing liquid-state cracks in EBM fabricated gamma'
   precipitation-strengthened superalloys. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All

TI Impact of forging direction on the recrystallization behaviour of nickel

AB AD730 (TM) is a newly developed Ni-based superalloy for turbine disk
   applications produced by cast and wrought processes. Conventional
   ingot-to-billet conversion is an expensive and very complex operation.
   Because of the difficulties to achieve a uniform strain for
   recrystallization, large unrecrystallized grains are retained along this
   process. Heterogeneities of grain size have a negative impact on
   subsequent forging processes as well as ultrasonic inspectability of the
   destination part. The main aim of this work is to analyse the impact of
   both forging direction (billet, cogging) and strain (epsilon = 0.3-2) on
   the microstructural evolution of AD730 at subsolvus temperatures from a
   semi-finished product (billet) under conditions representative of both
   cogging and hot forging operations. Special attention to the presence of
   large unrecrystallized grains was paid. Double truncated cones (DTCs)
   were hot forged at subsolvus temperatures followed by air cooling. SEM
   and EBSD analysis were conducted in the as-received (billet) and the
   as-forged conditions. AD730 alloy presents a complex microstructure
   characterized by the presence of large unrecrystallized grains, aligned
   in the billet direction, with remarkable differences in gamma'
   precipitates distribution as compared to recrystallized structures. The
   fine distribution of primary gamma' precipitates (pinning effect) plays
   a key role on grain size control but also on the recrystallization
   behaviour. Continuous dynamic recrystallization (CDRX) mechanism was
   found to be operating in the large unrecrystallized grains, promoting
   the formation intragranular DRX grains and the gradual recrystallization
   of these grains. Strain presents a strong effect on the microstructural
   evolution of AD730, increasing the recrystallization fraction and
   refining the structure. By contrast, no significant effect associated to
   the forging direction was found. Conditions representative of cogging
   operations (epsilon <= 0.6) at subsolvus temperatures were translated
   into large fractions of unrecrystallized structures (strain
   accumulation).

AB Failure of as-welded Hastelloy C-276 specimen in uni-axial tensile test
   has been reported to occur at the weld joint with around 50% reduction
   in elongation length relative to that of as-received Hastelloy C-276
   specimen. The proposed reason for such an occurrence is due to the
   micro-segregation of elements during solidification of the weld zone.
   Micro-segregation causes formation of brittle inter-metallic phases,
   mainly at the grain boundaries of the weld zone, leading to a change in
   deformation behavior of the welded specimen. Reduction in the linear
   heat input required for welding tends to reduce micro-segregation.
   Ytterbium fiber laser with its higher melting efficiency, requires lower
   linear heat input for welding, in comparison to other sources of heat.
   In the present investigation, Ytterbium fiber laser has been used for
   welding of 3 mm thick Hastelloy C-276 sheet and the tensile strength
   properties of the as-welded specimens have been studied. It is observed
   that the fiber laser as-welded specimens fail at the base metal, and the
   percent elongation is found to be increase twice as compared to that of
   previous reported literatures. Analysis of the fiber laser as-welded
   specimen showed (a) Reduction in micro-segregation within the weld zone
   due to high cooling rate (=MOO degrees C/s) of the melt pool; (b)
   Cooling time through the sensitization temperature range at the
   heat-affected zone was found to be 1.01 s as compared to 360 s required
   for precipitation of inter-metallic phase; (c) Ductile nature of the
   weld zone due to presence of inclined cellular dendrites at the weld
   centerline facilitating plastic deformation; and (d) Significant
   increase in elongation of heat-affected zone grains as compared to that
   of the base metal grains. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   obtained by high-speed direct laser deposition were discussed in the
   paper. The technology of high-speed direct laser deposition has been
   successfully applied during the formation of samples with the various
   operating parameters of the experimental device. The laser power was
   between 450 and 1200W, the scanning speed was 1.2mm/s, the powder feed
   rate was 45g/min, and the laser beam diameter was 1.2mm. The structure
   and phase composition of the initial material and as-deposited samples
   were studied using optical and scanning electron microscopy, x-ray
   analysis and transmission electron microscopy. The investigation has
   shown that spherical particles of powder (EP741) can be used to form
   products by additive manufacturing with the presence of additional heat
   treatment, since almost all the as-deposited samples obtained do not
   contain cracks, and large volume of pores was observed only in the
   sample obtained with the power of 450W. In addition, the phase
   composition of the as-deposited samples showed a high content of
   precipitating phase Ni-3(Al, Ti) in matrix, which is coherent to the
   solid solution based on nickel. In theory, the presence of Ni-3(Al, Ti)
   phase corresponds to the heat-treated nickel-base alloy obtained by
   standard methods of processing.

AB In order to clarify the microstructure evolution characteristics during
   holding period after slight degree of deformation for a Ni-Cr-Mo-based
   C276 superalloy, two-stage isothermal compression tests have been
   performed at the temperature range of 1000-1150 degrees C and the strain
   rate range of 0.1-5s(-1). The stress-strain curves and microstructure
   observation infer that both static recovery (SRV) and static
   recrystallization (SRX) took place during the holding period when the
   specimens were deformed at 1100-1150 degrees C and only SRV occurred in
   the specimens that deformed at the temperatures lower than 1100 degrees
   C. The softening effects increase with the increasing temperature and
   deformation degree, while the influence of strain rate seems less
   pronounced because of the limited stored energy resulted from the small
   deformation. The grain boundary characteristics, analyzed using electron
   backscatter diffraction technique, indicate that high densities of twins
   and sigma 3 grain boundaries form associated with the nucleation and
   growth of SRX grains. Finally, the recrystallization during and after
   deformation, i.e., dynamic recrystallization, SRX and metadynamic
   recrystallization, was discussed concurrently.

   with Os addition generally increases first, and then decreases. Thirdly,
   the further comprehensive discussion on possible substitution of Re by
   Os in new-generation nickel-based single-crystal superalloys were

   m thickness as the interlayer. The progression of isothermal
   solidification was completed at 1120 degrees C in the bonding time of 45
   minutes and a single-phase gamma solid solution was formed at the
   centerline. Insufficient bonding times led to a formation of centerline
   eutectic products composed of gamma solid solution, Ni-rich boride, and
   Cr-rich boride phases. A reverse relationship between the bonding time
   and the width of eutectic micro-constituents was perceived. Some
   precipitates with blocky and widmanstatten morphologies were observed in
   the diffusion-affected zone (DAZ) which seemed to be Cr-rich borides.
   The maximum precipitation depth, the number, and the area fraction of
   DAZ precipitates were investigated. It was revealed that the
   microhardness distribution across the joints was governed by changes in
   the area fraction of DAZ precipitates. The applied shear tests
   demonstrated an increment in shear properties of the bonds by increasing
   the bonding time. A remarkable joint efficiency of 83pct accompanied by
   a high failure energy (35 J) and displacement (1.8 mm) was achieved in
   the bond made at 1120 degrees C for 60 minutes. The fractographic
   examination of the fracture surfaces illustrated two different
   dimple-like and semi-cleavage morphologies for the bonds with complete
   isothermal solidification and partial isothermal solidification,

   between the grain orientation evolution and the changes of stress
   rupture properties were also studied. The results show that the
   specimens with different initial grain sizes present different grain
   orientation evolution behaviors during the constant stress loading
   process, and the stress rupture lives of alloy are closely related to
   the orientation changes. Specimen with large initial grain size
   generally exhibits a small lattice rotation, in the [101] orientation
   and consequently, a long stress rupture life. On the converse, the fine
   grain specimen exhibits significantly shorter life with much more [111]
   orientation, since the lattice is obviously rotated and the deformation
   has little coordination. Further analysis shows that initial grain size
   affects the misorientation distribution in the grain, which has a
   significant influence on the stress rupture life. The lower the
   misorientation angle and the higher the proportion of the low-angle
   misorientation is, the longer the rupture time it exhibits.

   of a gamma-gamma' structure and minor precipitates, such as MC carbide.
   FSP tests evaluated the tool performance at different rotation and
   welding speeds and the effect of shielding gas was also analyzed. Prior
   to FSP tests, hot compression tests showed that the tool material
   microstructure was stable below 950 degrees C, which affected positively
   its mechanical strength. It was observed the FSP tool overheating at
   rotation speed of 400 rpm. In this condition the gamma-gamma' structure
   was destabilized forming "gamma' free zones" at the tool shoulder. In
   these zones new gamma-grains were formed by recrystallization. Oxygen
   diffusion occurred at gamma-grain boundaries embritding the gamma' free
   zones that were ripped out by abrasion during FSP tests. The tool wear
   damage was mitigated by controlling friction processing parameters, such
   as rotation and welding speeds, Z-force values and gas shielding. The
   FSP made in this work improved surface properties of X70 steel.

AB The microstructural and chemical evolution after different processing
   steps of Ta-containing NiCoCrAlY bond coats (BC) sprayed by high
   velocity oxy-fuel on Ni-base superalloy (SA) substrates, top-coated with
   7YSZ and furnace cycled at 1100 degrees C focusing along the BC/SA
   interfaces is presented. Three superalloys were selected considering
   their Ta content relative to that within the BC: a) no Ta in the
   superalloy composition (IN100) and either b) similar or c) higher Ta
   content with respect to the BC (M247LC SX and CMSX-4, respectively). The
   processing conditions were as-sprayed, as-annealed, after EB-PVD
   deposition of a 7YSZ top coat, and after furnace cyclic tests (1100
   degrees C/120 h). The evolution of chemical composition after the
   different process steps are presented that include a normalization
   criteria to a Ni-Al-Cr system, elemental profiles as well as Weibull
   distribution plots of minor containing elements such as Ti, Ta, Mo, or W
   at the BC/SA interface. The effect of Ta was activated in some coated
   substrates by the presence of Ti and C in the superalloy consisting of
   inward Tadiffusion, trapping of outward diffusing Ti and the subsequent
   formation of (Ta, Ti)-rich carbides in the BC avoiding possible
   segregation effects as titanium oxide in the oxide scale.

AB In the present work, the high-temperature deformation behavior of a
   U720LI alloy was investigated by means of hot compression tests at
   temperatures of 1060-1180 degrees C, strain rates of 0.001-10s(-1) under
   true strain of 0.8. The Arrhenius-type model, considering the
   dissolution of gamma' precipitates, was established on the basis of the
   friction and adiabatic heating corrected flow stress data. The hot
   deformation activation energies for quasi-gamma phase and gamma+gamma'
   dual-phase microstructures were determined as 417 kJ mol(-1) and 687 kJ
   mol(-1), respectively. The high activation energy for gamma+gamma'
   dual-phase microstructures was mainly attributed to the precipitation
   hardening effect of gamma' (Ni-3(Al,Ti)) particles which hindered
   dislocation slip via the pinning effect during hot deformation. The
   processing map was developed based on the dynamic material model.
   According to the detailed microstructural investigations, the optimum
   hot deformation domains of U720LI alloy were identified as 1080-1100
   degrees C/0.01-0.3s(-1) for gamma+gamma' dual-phase microstructure and
   1140-1160 degrees C/0.01-0.1s(-1) for quasi-gamma phase microstructure,

   reducing the density, increasing the gamma' volume fraction and
   coarsening rate, reducing the Vickers hardness but increasing the yield
   strength at 750 degrees C. The replacement of 1 at% W by 1 at% Mo
   remarkably reduced the density with a negligible effect on the gamma'
   coarsening rate; Meanwhile, this slightly reduced the gamma' solvus
   temperature and volume fraction causing a slight decrease of Vickers
   hardness and yield strength at 750 degrees C. The experimental alloys
   all show relatively low density, large processing window, good
   microstructure stability at 750 degrees C and mechanical properties,

   solidification quenching experiments. The results showed that the
   as-cast microstructure of the Co-7Al-8W alloy (Base alloy) is the gamma
   single phase. The Al element slightly segregates to the interdendritic
   regions, the W element slightly segregates to the dendritic core, and Co
   has almost no segregation. The solidification path of the Co-7Al-8W-4Ti
   alloy is L -> L-1+gamma -> L-2+gamma+(beta+gamma')(e) ->

   the addition of 1 at.% Ti, there is no change in the segregation of
   elements, the microstructure and the solidification path of the alloy.
   The Ta element strongly segregates to the interdendritic regions in the
   Co-7Al-8W-1Ta alloy. With the addition of 4 at.% Ti, the Ti element
   strongly segregates to the interdendritic regions, and the segregation
   of Al and W elements increases. Blocky gamma' phase and (beta+y')(e)
   eutectics form in the interdendritic regions. The solidification path of

   L-3+gamma+(beta+gamma')(e)+gamma' ->gamma+(beta+gamma')(e)+y', After the
   addition of 1 at.% Ta+4 at.% Ti, the segregation of Al, Ta and Ti
   decreases, while the segregation of W increases. Laves phase, blocky
   gamma' phase and ((beta+y')e eutectics form in the interdendritic

AB The relationship between the microstructure and impact toughness,
   especially the formation of the lamellar carbides and its effect on the
   impact toughness of theheat-affected zone of Alloy 617 (Alloy 617-HAZ),
   was systematically investigated. Impact test was performed on Alloy
   617/9%Cr dissimilar welded joints aged for different time at 620 degrees
   C. The results showed that the characteristic zones of the whole welded
   joint revealed decreased impact toughness with increasing the aging
   time. The impact energies in weld metal showed high stability despite
   the aging process, while the Alloy 617-HAZ for all testing specimens
   presented the lowest impact toughness with various aging time.
   Meanwhile, the mixed grains were found in the base metal(BM) and
   heat-affected zone of Alloy 617, together with the twins with different
   widths located in the interior of the large grains. The columnar and
   equiaxed grain zones appear alternately due to the multilayer and
   multi-pass welding technique. In particular, compared with Alloy 617-BM,
   coarsened and even lamellar carbides were observed in Alloy 617-HAZ.
   These special carbides can separate the grains and therefore result in
   the formation of intergranular fracture morphology in Alloy 617-HAZ.
   Besides, the microhardness distribution was tested with a proper load,
   and the results exhibited that the weld possessed the highest hardness
   for all specimens with various aging time. The higher microhardness in
   Alloy 617-HAZ compared with that in Alloy 617-BM was attributed to the
   high density of the dislocations, which could be detected by
   transmission electron microscope. As a result, the coarsened carbides
   aggregated in the grain boundaries to form the lamellar layer are deemed
   as the main factor to reduce the impact toughness in Alloy 617-HAZ.

AB Up to now, there are few reports on the yield behavior of Ni-based
   superalloy during plastic deformation. However, an accurate yield stress
   model is significant for simulating the plastic forming process by
   cellular automaton or finite element methods. Therefore, the yield
   behavior of a solution-treated Ni-based superalloy is studied by hot
   compression tests. In order to evaluate yield stresses from the measured
   flow stress curves, the yield process is analyzed in terms of
   dislocation theory. Then, yield stresses at different deformation
   temperatures and strain rates are clearly determined. The experimental
   results show that the yield stresses are highly sensitive to deformation
   temperature and strain rate. The determined yield stress almost linearly
   increases with the increase of the logarithm of strain rate or the
   reciprocal of deformation temperature. A yield stress model is developed
   to correlate the yield behavior of the studied solution-treated Ni-based
   superalloy with deformation temperature, strain rate, and strengthening
   effect of alloying elements. The developed model can well describe the
   yield behavior of the studied solution-treated Ni-based superalloy.

AB Critical rotating components used in the hot section of gas turbine
   engines are subject to cyclic loading conditions during operation, and
   the life of these structures is governed by their ability to resist
   fatigue. Since it is well known that microstructural parameters, such as
   grain size, can significantly influence the fatigue behavior of the
   material, the conventional processes involved with the manufacture of
   these structures are carefully controlled in an effort to engineer the
   resulting microstructure. For a commercial Ni-base superalloy, RR1000,
   the development of process models and deformation mechanism maps has
   enabled not only control of the resultant grain size but also the
   ability to tailor and manipulate the resulting grain boundary character
   distribution. The increased level of microstructural control was coupled
   with a physics-based fatigue model to form an integrated computational
   materials engineering framework that was used to guide the design of
   damage-tolerant microstructures. Simulations from a 3D crystal
   plasticity finite element model were used to identify microstructural
   features associated with strain localization during cyclic loading and
   to guide the design of polycrystalline microstructures optimized for
   fatigue resistance. Conventionally processed and grain boundary
   engineered forgings of a commercial Ni-based superalloy, RR1000, were
   produced to validate the design methodology. For nominally equivalent
   grain sizes, high-resolution strain maps generated via digital image
   correlation confirmed that the high density of twin boundaries in the
   grain boundary engineered material were desirable microstructural
   features as they contribute to limiting the overall length of persistent
   slip bands that often serve as precursors for the nucleation of fatigue
   cracks.

AB Inconel 718 is a precipitation-strengthened Ni-based superalloy which
   finds applications across a wide temperature range (up to 650 degrees
   C). It shows excellent yield strength, ductility, creep resistance and
   fatigue strength. Surface treatment is known to improve the fatigue life
   of materials via nano-crystallization of the surface layer. However, the
   precipitation behavior of the surface-treated layer is largely
   unexplored. In this regard, the present study aims to investigate and
   compare the precipitation in the surface-treated layer and the bulk
   solution-treated IN718. The material is subjected to surface mechanical
   attrition treatment (SMAT) after solution treatment and is followed by a
   two-step aging treatment which promotes the precipitation of / in the
   alloy. The precipitation behavior shown by the bulk and SMAT layer was
   different. After aging, the bulk shows a microcrystalline matrix
   containing precipitates, whereas the microstructure of the surface layer
   consists of nanograins with nanotwins. No evidence of / precipitates
   were observed in the SMAT layer. The formation of nanograins in the
   surface layer after aging is attributed to recrystallization with
   controlled grain growth. The differential microstructures due to the
   chosen processing route have resulted in increased hardness of the
   surface layer and increased wear life of the material.

   long-term thermal exposure (LTTE) and the effects on creep deformation
   mechanisms of a hot corrosion-resistant single-crystal Ni-based
   superalloy with a low gamma' volume fraction and gamma/gamma' lattice
   misfit were investigated in detail. The kinetic of gamma' coarsening in
   the experimental alloy conforms well to the Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner
   theory during LTTE at 900 degrees C up to 10,000 hours. The evolution of
   gamma/gamma' lattice misfit during the LTTE was also investigated by a
   first attempt. The focused research emphasized on the influences of
   gamma/gamma' lattice misfit evolution after the LTTE on the
   microstructural degradation, dislocation motion, and different creep
   mechanisms during high-temperature low-stress creep and high-temperature
   high-stress creep. The results show that the decreasing of the absolute
   values of gamma/gamma' lattice misfit and change of gamma' size and
   morphology after the LTTE contribute to the weakening of barrier to the
   dislocation cutting process into gamma' precipitates during creep and
   the sharp reduction of stress-rupture lifetime at 950 degrees C/280 MPa
   after 1000 hours exposure. As the applied stress decreased to 230 MPa at
   950 degrees C, the creep mechanisms change from the dislocation cutting
   through gamma' precipitates at high applied stress to the dislocation
   glide and climb around gamma' precipitates. The dislocation glide and
   climb by-pass deformation mechanism were not significantly influenced by
   the change of gamma' precipitates morphology and magnitude of
   gamma/gamma' mismatch within 1000 hours thermal exposure, and the
   minimum creep rate and creep lifetime after 1000 hours thermal exposure
   were similar to that of the original heat-treated samples. (C) The

   mainly showed epitaxially grown columnar grains with fine equiaxed

   discontinuous DRX (DDRX) and continuous DRX (CDRX) processes, which were
   induced by the cyclic thermal stress resulting from the repeated laser
   deposition. The bulging of pre-existing grains and sub-grain rotation
   were the main mechanisms of the DDRX and CDRX phenomena, respectively.
   Additionally, after the occurrence of DRX, the dislocations were
   released and there was no distortion in the recrystallised grains.
   Coarse equiaxed grains were present in the top zone of the deposit;
   these grains were formed by the columnar-to-equiaxed transition during
   the solidification of the molten pool after the end of the laser
   re-melting and deposition process.

AB In this study, the effect of solution heat treatments on the

   fabricated by laser solid forming was investigated. The microstructure
   of deposit was mainly composed of columnar grains, which didn't change
   until the solution temperature reached 1200 degrees C after solution
   heat treatment. Due to the large size Laves phase which can pin grain
   boundary and obstruct grain boundary migration, the recrystallization
   fully occurred when the solution temperature exceeded 1200 degrees C.
   With the increment of the solution temperature, the average diffusion
   coefficient of solute elements and the dissolution velocity increased
   obviously. Besides, the volume fraction and size of Laves phase
   decreased, and the dislocation density decreased apparently. As a
   result, the microhardness and yield strength decreased with the
   increment of the solution temperature, but the tensile strength didn't
   change much after solution heat treatment, and the elongation increased
   significantly with the solution temperature improving. The
   room-temperature tensile properties in different states of Inconel 625

AB The research of Nickel-based superalloys with excellent mechanical
   properties is of significance for aerospace. Here we report the effect
   of sintering temperature of 850 degrees C, 900 degrees C and 950 degrees
   C with the heating rate of 100 degrees C/min via spark plasma sintering
   (SPS) on Inconel 718 (IN718) superalloy reinforced with 0.25 wt. %
   reduced oxide graphene (RGO). The microstructures and mechanical
   properties of IN718-RGO composite were investigated by scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM) and MTS servo hydraulic testing machine, respectively.
   SEM results demonstrate that the RGO is almost uniformly distributed
   into the IN718 powders after 3D rock-milling for 8 h. The mechanical
   properties of the composite increase with increasing the sintering
   temperature. When the sintering temperature is 950 degrees C, a relative
   density of 92.5%, a microhardness of 375 Hv and an ultimate compressive
   strength of 1748.20 MPa after aging heat treatment was obtained for the
   IN718-0.25 wt. % RGO, respectively. The fracture mechanism of the
   composite changes from intergranular fracture to transgranular fracture
   with the sintering temperature increasing. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All

AB The microstructure, stress rupture properties and deformation mechanisms
   of a new alloy during long-term aging were investigated. The
   microstructure evolution mainly included the coarsening of gamma' phase
   and the precipitation of eta phase. During aging at 700 degrees C, 750
   degrees C and 800 degrees C, the coarsening rate k of gamma' phase was
   about 7.818 nm(3)/h, 42.927 nm(3)/h and 178.226 nm(3)/h, respectively.
   The activation energy Q for gamma' coarsening was about 279.98 kJ/mol,
   which meant that element diffusion controlled the coarsening of gamma'
   phase. After aging at 750 degrees C for 3000 h and 800 degrees C for
   2000 h, a new needle-like eta phase was precipitated near GBs and around
   MC carbides, then grew into the grain interiors. The quantity of eta
   phase increased with the increase of aging time. With the growth of eta
   phase, gamma' depleted zones were found around eta phase. This was
   principally because both gamma' phase and eta phase were enriched in Ni
   and Ti, and the growing up of I phase absorbed gamma' phase. After aging
   at 700 degrees C for 300-3000 h and 750 degrees C for 300-2000 h, the
   stress rupture life at 750 degrees C/430 MPa remained at a high level
   and most of them were higher than 100 h. That was because the slightly
   grown-up gamma' phase acted as strong obstacles to the dislocation
   motion, Orowan bypassing combing stacking fault shearing acted as the
   dominant mechanism during stress rupture deformation. After aging at 750
   degrees C and 800 degrees C for 3000 h, the stress rupture life
   decreased to 45.7 h and 7.68 h, respectively. One reason was that the
   seriously grown-up gamma' phase was very hard to impede the dislocation
   motion, almost all gamma' phases were cut by dislocations with leaving
   stacking faults inside them during stress rupture deformation. The other
   reason was that needle-like eta phase promoted dislocation pile-up and
   contributed to the nucleation of micro-cracks, meanwhile the gamma'
   depleted zones could be conductive to the propagation of micro-cracks.

AB The efficiency of generating electricity from heat using concentrated
   solar power plants (which use mirrors or lenses to concentrate sunlight
   in order to drive heat engines, usually involving turbines) may be
   appreciably increased by operating with higher turbine inlet
   temperatures, but this would require improved heat exchanger materials.
   By operating turbines with inlet temperatures above 1,023 kelvin using
   closed-cycle high-pressure supercritical carbon dioxide (sCO(2))
   recompression cycles, instead of using conventional (such as subcritical
   steam Rankine) cycles with inlet temperatures below 823 kelvin(1-3), the
   relative heat-to-electricity conversion efficiency may be increased by
   more than 20 per cent. The resulting reduction in the cost of
   dispatchable electricity from concentrated solar power plants (coupled
   with thermal energy storage(4-6)) would be an important step towards
   direct competition with fossil-fuel-based plants and a large reduction
   in greenhouse gas emissions(7). However, the inlet temperatures of
   closed-cycle high-pressure sCO(2) turbine systems are limited(8) by the
   thermomechanical performance of the compact, metal-alloy-based,
   printed-circuittype heat exchangers used to transfer heat to sCO(2).
   Here we present a robust composite of ceramic (zirconium carbide, ZrC)
   and the refractory metal tungsten (W) for use in printed-circuit-type
   heat exchangers at temperatures above 1,023 kelvin(9). This composite
   has attractive high-temperature thermal, mechanical and chemical
   properties and can be processed in a cost-effective manner. We
   fabricated ZrC/W-based heat exchanger plates with tunable channel
   patterns by the shape-and-size-preserving chemical conversion of porous
   tungsten carbide plates. The dense ZrC/W-based composites exhibited
   failure strengths of over 350 megapascals at 1,073 kelvin, and thermal
   conductivity values two to three times greater than those of iron- or
   nickel-based alloys at this temperature. Corrosion resistance to sCO(2)
   at 1,023 kelvin and 20 megapascals was achieved 19 by bonding a copper
   layer to the composite surface and adding 50 parts per million carbon
   monoxide to sCO(2). Techno-economic analyses indicate that ZrC/W-based
   heat exchangers can strongly outperform nickel-superalloy-based
   printed-circuit heat exchangers at lower cost.

AB The phase transformation characteristics of alloy 617B are investigated
   in the temperature range of 600 -800 degrees C for up to 10000 h using a
   combination of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron
   microscopy (TEM) and precise chemical analysis. The gamma' phase is
   stable during 600-720 degrees C aging but degenerates quickly at 800
   degrees C. The M23C6 carbide shows a plate-like shape and has a
   cube-on-cube orientation relationship with the gamma matrix. The
   chemical composition and lattice parameter of phases are determined by
   precise chemical analysis. The phase evolution is an element
   diffusion-related process, and the element redistribution relationship
   is established here. In the precipitation and coarsening process, the
   gamma' phase absorbs the elements Al and Ti and rejects Cr and Mo
   elements into the matrix. M23C6 carbide is confirmed by chemical
   analysis to be rich in Cr and Mo. The rejected Cr and Mo elements from
   the gamma' phase can transfer into M23C6 carbide during the coarsening
   of M23C6 carbide. In addition, the Mo- and Cr-rich mu phase is detected,
   and the precipitation of the mu phase competes with M23C6 carbide for Mo
   and Cr. Hence, the interaction between phases should be taken into
   consideration for better control of microstructure stability in the
   alloy 617B. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   bond coated Inconel 718 superalloy substrate using air plasma spray
   process. The hot corrosion study was conducted in simulated gas turbine
   environments (molten mixtures of 50 wt% Na2SO4 + 50 wt% V2O5 and 90 wt%
   Na2SO4 + 5 wt% V2O5 + 5 wt% NaCl) for two different temperatures of 700
   and 900 degrees C. A developed SSA TBCs showed about 8% and 22% lower
   lifetime at 700 and 900 degrees C, respectively than YSZ TBCs in 50 wt%
   Na2SO4 + 50 wt% V2O5 (vanadate). The hot corrosion life of SSA TBCs
   being found about 13% and 39% lower than YSZ TBCs in 90 wt% Na2SO4 + 5
   wt% V2O5 + 5 wt% NaCl (chloride) at 700 and 900 degrees C, respectively.
   X-ray diffraction results showed the formation of SmVO4, SrV2O6 and
   SrSO4 as a major hot corrosion product in 50 wt% Na2SO4 + 50 wt% V2O5
   and 90 wt% Na2SO4 + 5 wt% V2O5 + 5 wt% NaCl environments respectively
   for SSA TBCs. Similarly, YSZ TBCs also showed YVO4 as hot corrosion
   product in vanadate and chloride environments. Both the TBCs suffer a
   more severe hot corrosion attack in chloride environment at 900 degrees
   C. The leaching of Sr2+ and Y3+ ions from SSA and YSZ respectively play
   a vital role in the destabilization of coating in vanadate and chloride
   environments at 700 and 900 degrees C. In both SSA and YSZ TBCs, the
   leaching of ion has significantly low influence as compared to attack by
   chloride ions at the bond coat-top coat interface in the presence of
   chloride environment. The hot corrosion resistance of SSA TBCs was
   improved three times higher in the presence of MgO and NiO inhibitor in
   vanadate environment at 900 degrees C mainly due to the formation of a
   stable Ni3V2O8 phase at the surface.

AB High-temperature compressive experiments of a Ni-based superalloy

   behavior of delta phase in hot deformation process is quantitatively
   investigated. The dissolution mechanisms of delta phase are analyzed by
   Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and first-principles
   calculations. Results reveal that the dissolution of delta phase is
   accelerated with increasing deformation temperature or deformation
   degree. But, the dissolution of delta phase becomes weaken as the strain
   rate is raised. The shear modulus (G) and bulk modulus (B) of delta
   phase decrease with increasing temperature or reducing pressure. The
   positive Cauchy pressure (C-12-C-44) and the larger ratio of B/G
   (greater than 1.75) reveal that delta phase is ductile at high
   temperatures or pressures. The intense interactions between dislocations
   and delta phase induce the stress concentration and the rapid diffusion
   of Nb atoms, which accelerate the precipitation/dissolution of delta
   phase. A phenomenological model is established for depicting the
   dissolution behavior of delta phase in hot deformation process. The
   measured results are identical with the forecasted ones, which
   demonstrates the established model is feasible to accurately depict the
   dynamic dissolution behaviors of delta phase in hot deformation process.

   technology was applied to manufacture a series of Inconel 718 thin walls
   (ultra-thin plates) to explore their printability, microstructures,
   crystallographic features and microhardness under keyhole and conduction
   modes. Results show that it is feasible to manufacture Inconel 718 thin
   walls with a thickness of similar to 0.2 mm by SLM. Keyhole mode is
   favorable for a better printability, finer dendrites, the precipitation
   of strengthening phases of gamma'/gamma '', a stronger < 001 > texture
   in- tensity and a higher microhardness in the center zone of the SLMed
   thin wall. Conduction mode contributes to the uniform microstructures
   and microhardness in the marginal and center zones of the thin wall.
   Also, the decrease of area fraction in strengthening phases and the
   increase of Laves phase result in a decreasing trend of microhardness
   along the deposition direction. Finally, microstructural formation and
   evolution mechanisms of SLMed thin walls under two modes are proposed
   based on the solidification conditions and vertical thermal cycles. (C)

AB Cold spray is capable to additively manufacture oxide-free metallic
   parts in open air due to its low processing temperature. However, for
   metals with relatively high hardness such as Inconel 718 superalloy
   (IN718), it is still a big challenge to get dense deposits by using
   low-priced nitrogen gas. In this work, In-situ micro-forging (MF) was
   introduced to cold spray by mechanically mixing big-sized 410 stainless
   steel (410SS) particles into the IN718 powder so that the deposited
   IN718 layer can be hammered and plastically deformed by the MF particles
   during spraying and results in fully dense deposits. As 50 vol% MF
   particles were mixed into the IN718 powder, the porosity was decreased
   from 5.6% to 0.26%. Due to the low impact velocity, 410SS particles were
   not embedded into the IN718 deposits and the possible contamination was
   avoided. An oxide scale removal induced increment in deposition
   efficiency was detected for the first time. Due to the lower porosity
   and enhanced inter-particle bonding, a great improvement in ultimate
   strength from 96 to 464 MPa was achieved by the in-situ MF effect. After
   heat treated at 1200 degrees C for 6 h, the sample fractured at a high
   strength of 1089 MPa and revealed a ductile fracture manner. (C) 2018

   The grinding also affected the oxide scale morphology, resulting in a
   protective alumina scale, while the polished samples developed
   Ni-/Cr-rich mixed oxides on the surface. Better oxidation resistance of
   the ground surfaces is related to a higher concentration of defects in
   the near-surface region introduced by cold working. These defects
   facilitate the outward transport of the scale-forming element Al and
   thus are beneficial for protective oxidation. The oxidation mechanism at
   lower temperatures was introduced. The model based on the generalized
   Darken method and multiphase approximation was proposed.

   components for the long-term service. Here, the authors found that
   fatigue strength of SLM-fabricated Inconel 718 is significantly improved
   after the proper heat treatment route not only due to the elimination of

   the appearance of ultrafine-scale acicular phases, which effectively

AB Nickel-based superalloys are widely used in the aeronautical industry,
   especially in components requiring excellent corrosion resistance,
   enhanced thermal fatigue properties, and thermal stability. Haynes 282
   is a nickel-based superalloy that was developed to improve the low
   weldability, formability, and creep strength of other
   gamma'-strengthened Ni superalloys. Despite the industrial interest in
   Haynes 282, there is a lack of research that is focused on this alloy.
   Moreover, it is difficult to find studies dealing with the machinability
   of Haynes 282. Although Haynes 282 is considered an alloy with improved
   formability when compared with other nickel alloys, its machining
   performance should be analyzed. High pressure and temperature localized
   in the cutting zone, the abrasion generated by the hard carbides
   included in the material, and the tendency toward adhesion during
   machining are phenomena that generate extreme thermomechanical loading
   on the tool during the cutting process. Excessive wear results in
   reduced tool life, leading to frequent tool change, low productivity,
   and a high consumption of energy; consequentially, there are increased
   costs. With regard to tool materials, cemented carbide tools are widely
   used in different applications, and carbide is a recommended cutting
   material for turning Haynes 282, for both finishing and roughing
   operations. This work focuses on the finishing turning of Haynes 282
   using coated carbide tools with conventional coolant. Machining forces,
   surface roughness, tool wear, and tool life were quantified for
   different cutting speeds and feeds.

AB The effect of the delta phase (Ni3Nb) on the electrically-assisted (EA)
   deformation responses, particularly stress, elongation and dislocation
   distribution, of the Ni-based superalloy is still unknown up to now,
   though it is clear as nonnegligible on the quasi-static and hot
   deformation processes. Therefore, the effect of the delta phase during
   the electrically-assisted tension were experimentally investigated and
   analyzed with comparison to that in the hot tension process. Generally,
   the delta phase existing in the Ni-based superalloy always causes the
   reduction of flow softening and elongation during cold and the initial
   stage of hot tension processes. What is distinct, the delta phase
   promotes the flow softening effect and elongation during the EA tension.
   In addition, the dislocation-free ring around the delta phase was
   firstly observed during the EA tension. The mechanism of these macro and
   micro extraordinary phenomena is concluded as that the delta phase
   causes serious lattice distortion and dislocation pile-up around itself,
   which leads to an extremely high temperature due to the local Joule
   heating effect. The faster elimination of dislocation pile-up in the
   local area because of the local higher temperature results in the
   dislocation-free ring phenomenon and the significant improvement of flow
   softening effect and elongation.

   and true strains ranging from 0 to 0.5 at a strain rate of 0.001 s(-1).
   The effect of HCB process parameters on the tensile strength was
   analyzed. Both the as-deformed and the interfacial microstructures were
   characterized using the optical microscope, electron backscattered
   diffraction and transmission electron microscope (TEM) analysis. The
   results of tensile property revealed that the degree of metallurgical
   bonding is promoted by increasing deformation temperature and strain.
   The evolution of the interfacial microstructure showed that the
   migration of interfacial grain boundary (IGB), which is characterized by
   discontinuous dynamic recrystallization, is the dominant metallurgical
   bonding mechanism in the early stages of bonding. TEM analysis indicated
   that the dislocation density is distributed heterogeneously over both
   sides of IGB, which is the significant reason for the migration of IGB,
   during the initial stage of HCB process.

AB Recently, cobalt-based gamma-gamma' microstructured superalloys have
   attracted attention. However, studies on their processing behavior
   [i.e., processing maps (the variation of strain rate sensitivity (m)
   with temperature)] are limited. Thus, the high-temperature flow behavior
   of a gamma-gamma' Co-30Ni-10Al-5Mo-2Ta-2Ti-5Cr (at. pct) superalloy was
   investigated using isothermal compression tests between 1348 and 1498 K
   at strain rates from 0.001 to 10 s(-1). The m contour map was generated
   using the experimental flow stress values, which were used to locate the
   optimum hot workability and desired microstructural processing range. A
   strong dependence of m on the deformation parameters (temperature,
   strain rate, and strain) was observed. A maximum m value of around 0.3
   at 1460 K to 1498 K and strain rates of 0.01 to 0.5 s(-1) was found. The
   deformed samples show a fully recrystallized microstructure at high m.
   Unstable domains showed the formation of cavities at the grain boundary
   triple points and cracks along the grain boundaries at high strain rates
   (1 to 10 s(-1)), corresponding to m < 0.10. A constitutive model was
   developed using an Arrhenius hyperbolic sine function, yielding an
   apparent activation energy of 540 +/- 30 kJ mol(-1) for hot deformation.
   This study indicates reasonable formability under certain conditions
   below the solvus, thus opening possibilities for further
   thermomechanical treatment. (C) The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society

AB The heat-affected zone (HAZ) liquation cracking mechanism of
   nickel-based superalloys with high (Al + Ti) content during the laser
   solid forming (LSF) process was investigated via laser remelting of an
   as-deposited IN-738LC superalloy. Microstructural HAZ analysis revealed
   that cracks consistently propagated from the HAZ to the remelting zone
   along the grain boundary (GB). The formation of a liquid film during GB
   liquation was mainly owing to localized melting of the semicontinuous
   gamma-gamma' eutectic distributed along the GB. The solute segregation
   behavior of the IN-738LC alloy during LSF was analyzed using the
   Giovanola-Kurz model and Scheil models, revealing that a significant
   enrichment of gamma-gamma' eutectic-forming elements in the residual
   liquid at the final stage of solidification (solid fraction similar to
   0.87) in the molten pool was the main cause of semicontinuous
   gamma-gamma' eutectic formation along the GB. Further, a B enrichment at
   the GB was identified in LSF-fabricated IN-738LC, which promoted
   cracking by lowering the GB liquation temperature and promoting wetting
   of the GB by the liquid film. Unlike the phenomenon observed in the
   welding of cast IN-738LC, the coherence between the gamma' phases and
   the gamma matrix in LSF-fabricated IN-738LC can suppress the occurrence
   of constitutional liquation of the gamma' phase. To understand the
   interaction between the thermal stress and the liquid film in the LSF
   process, thermal stress as a cracking driving force was also estimated
   based on the measurement of the residual stress from the substrate to
   the remelting zone of the IN-738LC deposit by the Vickers
   micro-indentation method. (C) The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society

   brittle boride precipitates near the brazing seam decreased. Graphene
   was effective in retarding solute atoms diffusion thus impeding the

   concentration of the brazed joints during the cooling process. The shear
   strengths of brazed joints were significantly improved by exerting the

AB In their operating environments, turbine blades usually suffer from
   microstructural degradation and a corresponding reduction in mechanical
   performance. Load-free and load-assisted experiments were conducted to
   determine the microstructural degradation kinetics of a directionally
   solidified (DS) Ni-based superalloy, DZ125, commonly applied as a
   first-stage blade material in aero-engines. The results show that a
   transition time from the linear law to the power law exists during
   isotropic coarsening in load-free testing. The directional coarsening
   behaviour of DZ125 under load-assisted intensifies with the increase in
   exposure temperature and applied stress. A unified analytical model for
   gamma' precipitate evolution of DZ125 superalloys, based on
   Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner (LSW) theory, was proposed to predict the
   experimentally observed increase in the coarsening extent associated
   with increase in temperature, time, and applied stress. Microstructural
   information, such as gamma' precipitate width and channel width in
   modelling work, was extracted using the cross correlation analysis
   algorithm. The model can accurately estimate the gamma' precipitate
   evolution of DS DZ125 superalloys. In addition, based on the model, the

   work, the microstructure changes and high-temperature flow
   characteristics of a Ni-based superalloy containing delta phases were
   researched by isothermal two-stage high-temperature compression
   experiments with stepped strain rates. It is revealed that the true
   stress of the later stage distinctly increases when the true
   strain/strain rate of the former stage or the strain rate of the later
   stage are raised. Meanwhile, the dynamic recrystallization (DRX) grains
   become finer, and the dissolution of delta phase is weakened. But, the
   coarsening of DRX grains and the dissolution of delta phase are enhanced
   as the deformation temperature is raised. The primary DRX nucleation
   mechanism is the discontinuous DRX. Based on the measured flow stress,
   an e-insensitive support vector regression (e-SVR) model is established
   for depicting the flow behavior of the researched alloy. The measured
   results are consistent with the forecasted ones, which illustrating that
   the developed e-SVR model is feasible to accurately describe the flow
   behaviors of the researched alloy during two-stage high-temperature
   deformation with stepped strain rates. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   fine grained microstructure with a high fraction of carbides and a
   gamma/gamma' microstructure was obtained. The compressive yield strength
   at room temperature was found to be 45% higher than that of previously
   reported results for Co-based superalloys. A similar level of strength
   was found at 700 degrees C. These extraordinary properties can be
   explained due to the multitude of hardening mechanisms that sintered
   Co-based superalloys possess: gamma' precipitation, carbide formation
   and the ultra-fine se-grain size promoted by the fast consolidation

AB Nickel-based superalloy is mainly used for fabricating the important
   high temperature parts including the turbine disk, turbine baffle,
   compressor disk, and other critical components. Ceramic inclusions in
   powder metallurgy (PM) superalloy could promote fatigue crack
   initiation, and thus accelerating the crack propagation under certain
   conditions. In this case, the ultra-clean nickel-based superalloy powder
   is critical for PM superalloy components. Generally, there are two
   well-known methods of fabricating superalloy powders, i.e., argon gas
   atomization (AA) and plasma rotating electrode process (PREP). Electrode
   induction melting gas atomization (EIGA) process is a newly developed
   method of preparing ultra-clean metal powders. The EIGA process is a
   completely crucible-free melting and atomization process developed by
   ALD vacuum technologies. In this process, a slowly rotating prealloyed
   bar is fed into a conical induction coil. The end of the bar is
   inductively heated and molten alloys falls into an atomizer where the
   liquid alloy is atomized with a high-pressure inert gas. The EIGA
   prepared powders possess the advantages of AA (more fine powders) and
   PREP (ultra-clean powders) processes. Generally, there are two key
   issues in EIGA process, and the free-fall gas atomizer design is one of
   the critical issues for the powder yield and quality. Free-fall gas
   atomizers are some of the first two fluid atomizer designs to be used
   for molten metal atomization. In a simple open (unconfined stream)
   design a melt stream falls from a tundish exit via gravity into the
   convergence of focused atomization gas jets where it is disintegrated.
   The gas-melt interaction is complex, and it is difficult to characterize
   the interaction process directly. To have a good understanding of the
   atomisation technology, the physical break-up process instead of
   correlating the gas dynamics with droplet fragmentation indirectly must
   be able to be examined. And it will be desirable, if we input the
   atomization parameters, we can obtain the particles' distributions
   directly. In this work, a computational fluid dynamic approach to
   simulating the primary and secondary atomization processes is developed
   by using the volume of fluid method and discrete phase model. By
   integrating the metal stream break-up (in primary atomization) with the
   flow field and particles distribution simulation (in second
   atomization), this numerical simulation method is able to provide the
   direct assessment for the atomisation process. To verify the method
   performance, the melt stream is initialized into a 4 mm-diameter stream,
   which is then injected into the gas flow field for further
   fragmentation. The experimental results show that the simulated
   particles' diameter distribution is consistent with the experimental
   results in the same conditions.

AB Pores and carbides inherited from SX superalloy manufacturing processes
   usually act as stress concentrators and are preferential sites for
   fatigue crack initiation. In this study, pore & carbide size, morphology
   and distribution in a SX superalloy MD2 has been evaluated by X-ray CT.
   Strain accumulation and fatigue cracking behaviour in MD2, particularly
   around the pores and carbides, has been investigated by ex-situ SEM-DIC
   at room temperature along with image-based modelling of the observed MD2
   defect populations obtained through X-ray CT imaging. The deformation
   structures have also been examined by electron channelling contrast
   imaging under controlled diffraction conditions. The results indicate
   that the pores & carbides with complicated three-dimensional features
   are the dominant fatigue crack initiation sites. Deformation is
   concentrated within intense slip bands and an enhanced strain
   accumulation around pores is captured by SEM-DIC. Dislocation motion is
   mainly confined to the gamma matrix channels with some dislocation shear
   cutting of gamma' precipitates also observed ahead of the crack tip. As
   the crack propagates, strain band density and dislocation density at the
   crack tip increases correspondingly. Image-based modelling using the
   observed defect populations in MD2 (micro)structure can effectively
   predict the stress concentrations and the resultant hot spot for
   subsequent fatigue crack initiation, which is consistent with the
   experimental observations.

   for 100 h. Fatigue life of the pre hot corroded specimens was
   drastically reduced at all the stress amplitudes studied. The variation
   of fatigue life with stress amplitude followed the Basquin relationship.
   The endurance limit of pre hot corroded specimens was reduced by 100 MPa
   in respect of that of the as heat treated sample. The reduction in
   fatigue life was found to be associated with pits formed on the surface
   due to evaporation of chlorides, from the prior hot corrosion in the
   above salt mixture, which led to early fatigue crack initiation and
   rapid crack propagation.

   Therefore, the developed brazing filler also avoids the need to perform
   post-brazing heat treatments that aim to eliminate detrimental extensive

AB Select laser melting (SLM) is one of the practical metal additive
   manufacturing processes to fabricate complex structures. The
   inhomogeneous microstructure and high residual stress are typically
   resulted from a non-uniform melting and rapid solidification during a
   SLM process, which has the significant impact on part dimensional
   instability, corrosion resistance, and mechanical properties. The bulk
   of current research is limited to the general characterization of grain
   size, texture, and mechanical properties. However, grain boundary
   character distribution (GBCD) and its relationship with texture are yet
   to be understood. This study has shown that the preferred <110> along
   building direction and <100> along laser scanning direction were
   produced. The high density of low angle grain boundary (LAGB) can be an
   indicator of residual stress levels in the as-SLMed samples. The
   newly-developed Sigma 3, Sigma 9 and Sigma 27 grain boundaries were
   heavily populated, and the cluster of grains interfaced by Sigma 3(n) (n
   = 0, 1, 2...) was introduced at the expense of LAGB only at high
   recrystallization annealing (1150 degrees C or over). The research
   results suggest that GBCD optimization be possible in the SLMed Inconel
   625 alloy via suitable post annealing, which allows improving
   intergranular corrosion resistance and enhancing mechanical properties.

   The dendritic solidification provides two phases in the dendritic cores
   and two different ones in the interdendritic regions. Three of the four

PY 2018
AB Alloy 718 is a Ni-based superalloy commonly used for parts of aircraft
   engines and power plants where very high demands on high-temperature
   yield strength, creep and corrosion resistance must be met.
   Polycrystalline parts such as turbine discs are industrially
   manufactured via hot-forging followed by solution annealing and dual
   ageing to form nanoscale gamma' and gamma '' precipitates. However,
   through the alternative process of 'direct ageing', increased yield
   strength contributions of similar to 10% can be achieved while
   maintaining sufficient creep resistance. In addition to this so-called
   'direct ageing effect', the omission of solution annealing between
   forging and ageing is economically attractive. Therefore, to date,
   direct ageing is widely implemented in the production of forged
   aerospace parts. However, the detailed mechanisms behind the direct
   ageing effect yet remain unclear. We present a correlative microscopy
   approach to identify the detailed microstructural evolution during
   conventional versus direct ageing. Our results confirm higher
   dislocation densities, lower delta-phase volume fractions and the
   absence of selected gamma-matrix grain growth, as suggested in previous
   research. However, a key finding reported here via the use of atom probe
   microscopy is a remarkable structuring within and between the nanoscale
   gamma' and gamma '' precipitation. Not only do we find an increase in
   both the volume fraction and size of the gamma '' precipitates after
   direct ageing, we report a prevalence of stacked co-precipitation in
   various sequences depending on the nucleation condition. The findings
   are summarized in a microstructural model for conventional and direct
   ageing. (C) 2018 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

AB A multi-phase, multi-component mean-field model has been developed for

   aim of this work is to develop predictive capability to aid in process
   optimisation and explore precipitation kinetics during additive

   during typical solid solution treatment and aging operations, and during

   Thermochemistry (CALPHAD) based modelling approach provides a unified
   particle growth rate which can capture the growth, coarsening and
   dissolution of gamma', gamma* and delta precipitates under relevant heat
   treatment conditions. To apply the model to AM, finite element
   simulations of a simple rectangular build have been carried out, using a
   property switching method to simulate the material deposition. The
   component level simulation provides the thermal fields to calculate
   precipitation kinetics during deposition, also allowing for the
   examination of the heat affected zone in the substrate. The modelling
   approach can capture the repeated nucleation and dissolution of
   precipitates that occurs during AM. The model shows good agreement with

AB Transient liquid phase (TLP) bonding has been broadly utilized to join

   its diffusion kinetics is still in infancy due to challenges in in situ
   experimental characterization under high operating temperatures. In this
   research, we examine detailed diffusion kinetics of Ni-based superalloy
   bonding with Ni nanoparticles employing molecular dynamics (MD), aiming
   to advance TLP bonding by achieving a desirable diffusion-induced joint
   microstructure. Diffusion kinetics of TLP bonding is compared with
   traditional constant heating method (CHM) bonding, by examining
   diffusion behaviors and microstructure. Self-diffusivity of each
   specific element is firstly calculated using MD, demonstrating a good
   agreement with the reported experimental values. The nanoscale size of
   Ni fillers and high operating temperature induce a large mobility, thus
   less porosity, while a slower diffusion in TLP bonding than CHM leads to
   a more crystallized microstructure with nano-sized grains. In addition,
   non-uniform diffusivity distribution of the surrounding elements
   influences diffusion pathway and joint microstructure. Therefore,
   desirable bonding properties can be achieved through Ni nano-filler,
   optimal temperature, as well as effective composition of atomic
   surroundings.

   in nearly all industrial sectors. AM is already well established in
   fields such as medicine or spare part production. Nevertheless,
   processing of high-performance nickel-based superalloys and especially
   single crystalline alloys such as CMSX-4 (R) is challenging due to the
   difficulty of intense crack formation. Selective electron beam melting
   (SEBM) takes place at high process temperatures (similar to 1000 A
   degrees C) and under vacuum conditions. Current work has demonstrated
   processing of CMSX-4 (R) without crack formation. In addition, by using
   appropriate AM scan strategies, even single crystals (SX SEBM CMSX-4
   (R)) develop directly from the powder bed. In this contribution, we
   investigate the mechanical properties of SX SEBM CMSX-4 (R) prepared by
   SEBM in the as-built condition and after heat treatment. The focus is on
   hardness, strength, low cycle fatigue, and creep properties. These
   properties are compared with conventional cast and heat-treated
   material.

AB Alloy718 specimens built by selective laser melting (SLM) and electron
   beam melting (EBM) were comparatively examined. The higher cooling rate
   resulted in a high dislocation density and interdendritic precipitates,
   which brought about inferior creep properties in SLM alloys. However, a
   low dislocation density, distributed delta precipitates and a strong 
   001  texture were observed in the EBM material. As a result, the creep
   life of the direct-aged EBM specimen approached 1100 hours and was
   comparable to that of conventional cast-and-wrought alloys at 650
   degrees C.

AB A Co-Ni-based alloy strengthened by gamma'-(L1(2)) precipitates was
   utilized to investigate the precipitation evolution after various
   cooling rates and several aging conditions. In this study, the
   precipitate size and volume fraction have been studied via scanning
   electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The influence
   of the precipitation evolution was measured via microhardness tests. The
   cooling rate study shows a more sluggish gamma' precipitation reaction
   compared to that observed in a Ni-based superalloy. Following a rapid
   cooling rate, the application of appropriate double aging treatments
   allows for the increase of the gamma' volume fraction as well as the
   control of the size and distribution of the precipitates. The highest
   hardness values reach those measured on supersolvus cast and wrought
   Ni-based superalloys. The observed gamma' precipitation behavior should
   have implications for the production, the heat treatment, the welding,
   or the additive manufacturing of this new class of high-temperature
   materials.

AB Very high cycle fatigue (VHCF) properties at high temperature of
   Ni-based single-crystal (SX) superalloys and of a directionally
   solidified (DS) superalloy have been investigated at 20 kHz and a
   temperature of 1000 degrees C. Under fully reversed conditions (R = -
   1), no noticeable difference in VHCF lifetimes between all investigated
   alloys has been observed. Internal casting pores size is the main VHCF
   lifetime-controlling factor whatever the chemical composition of the
   alloys. Other types of microstructural defects (eutectics, carbides), if
   present, may act as stress concentration sites when the number of cycles
   exceed 10(9) cycles or when porosity is absent by applying a prior hot
   isostatic pressing treatment. For longer tests (> 30 hours), oxidation
   also controls the main crack initiation sites leading to a mode I crack
   initiation from oxidized layer. Under such conditions, alloy's
   resistance to oxidation has a prominent role in controlling the VHCF.
   When creep damage is present at high ratios (R >= 0.8), creep resistance
   of SX/DS alloys governs VHCF lifetime. Under such high mean stress
   conditions, SX alloys developed to retard the initiation and creep
   propagation of mode I micro-cracks from pores have better VHCF
   lifetimes.

AB The direct and complete recycling method for Ni-base superalloy is being
   developed and studied to reduce the material cost for cost-effective
   operation of gas turbine systems. Understanding the effect of sulfur
   contamination is important to determine allowable sulfur content after
   the recycling. However, in the case of single-crystal superalloys, this
   effect on material properties is not well known except for the
   detrimental effect on the oxidation resistance. In the present study,
   creep tests, aging tests, and cyclic oxidation tests have been performed
   on PWA1484 with varying sulfur content. The increasing sulfur content
   has been found to correlate with degradation of properties evaluated
   here. It is observed that the decrease in creep life in PWA1484 due to
   sulfur doping is primarily due to coarsening of the gamma/gamma'
   interfacial dislocation network, increase in precipitation kinetics of
   topologically closed-packed phase, and decrease in oxidation resistance.
   For recycling purposes, a CaO crucible was used in the casting process,
   which successfully decreased the sulfur level in the alloy, and the
   resulting material showed comparable or even better properties in
   comparison to the low sulfur content material.

   (gamma') in coarse-grained RR1000 after isothermal exposure for various
   times (50 to 500 hours) at 700 degrees C and 750 degrees C. The impact
   of these isothermal treatments is then studied by carrying out dwell (1
   hour) fatigue crack growth tests at 700 degrees C in air. Such dwell
   periods can increase crack growth rates by nearly two orders of
   magnitude compared with baseline (0.25 Hz trapezoidal waveform) fatigue
   crack growth tests. Predominantly, scanning electron microscopy was used
   for gamma' analysis. Transmission electron microscopy was also utilized
   when necessary. Overaging as a thermodynamically driven and
   diffusion-controlled process strongly affects tertiary gamma'
   precipitates for the temperatures and treatment times investigated here.
   No influence of overaging on baseline fatigue behavior is observed.
   However, after overaging at 750 degrees C for 500 hours (which increases
   the mean tertiary gamma' size by a factor of two from 17 to 37 nm),
   dwell crack growth rates at 700 degrees C are reduced by one order of
   magnitude. Increased dwell fatigue crack growth resistance is also
   measured after overaging for 100 hours at 700 degrees C. The potential
   influence of gamma' distributions on dwell fatigue crack growth
   resistance is discussed in terms of stress relaxation behavior during
   dwell periods.

AB The effect of Nb on the properties and microstructure of two novel
   powder metallurgy (P/M) Ni-based superalloys was evaluated, and the
   results critically compared with the Rolls-Royce alloy RR1000. The
   Nb-containing alloy was found to exhibit improved tensile and creep
   properties as well as superior oxidation resistance compared with both
   RR1000 and the Nb-free variant tested. The beneficial effect of Nb on
   the tensile and creep properties was due to the microstructures obtained
   following the post-solution heat treatments, which led to a higher
   gamma' volume fraction and a finer tertiary gamma' distribution. In
   addition, an increase in the anti-phase-boundary energy of the gamma'
   phase is also expected with the addition of Nb, further contributing to
   the strength of the material. However, these modifications in the gamma'
   distribution detrimentally affect the dwell fatigue crack-growth
   behavior of the material, although this behavior can be improved through
   modified heat treatments. The oxidation resistance of the Nb-containing
   alloy was also enhanced as Nb is believed to accelerate the formation of
   a defect-free Cr2O3 scale. Overall, both developmental alloys, with and
   without the addition of Nb, were found to exhibit superior properties
   than RR1000.

AB Time-dependent plastic deformation through stress relaxation and creep
   deformation during in-situ cooling of the as-cast single-crystal
   superalloy CMSX-4((R)) has been studied via neutron diffraction,
   transmission electron microscopy, electro-thermal miniature testing, and
   analytical modeling across two temperature regimes. Between 1000 degrees
   C and 900 degrees C, stress relaxation prevails and gives rise to
   softening as evidenced by a decreased dislocation density and the
   presence of long segment stacking faults in gamma phase. Lattice strains
   decrease in both the gamma matrix and gamma' precipitate phases. A
   constitutive viscoplastic law derived from in-situ isothermal relaxation
   test under-estimates the equivalent plastic strain in the prediction of
   the stress and strain evolution during cooling in this case. It is
   thereby shown that the history dependence of the microstructure needs to
   be taken into account while deriving a constitutive law and which
   becomes even more relevant at high temperatures approaching the solvus.
   Higher temperature cooling experiments have also been carried out
   between 1300 degrees C and 1150 degrees C to measure the evolution of
   stress and plastic strain close to the gamma' solvus temperature.
   In-situ cooling of samples using ETMT shows that creep dominates during
   high-temperature deformation between 1300 degrees C and 1220 degrees C,
   but below a threshold temperature, typically 1220 degrees C work
   hardening begins to prevail from increasing gamma' fraction and
   resulting in a rapid increase in stress. The history dependence of prior
   accumulated deformation is also confirmed in the flow stress
   measurements using a single sample while cooling. The saturation
   stresses in the flow stress experiments show very good agreement with
   the stresses measured in the cooling experiments when viscoplastic
   deformation is dominant. This study demonstrates that experimentation
   during high-temperature deformation as well as the history dependence of
   the microstructure during cooling plays a key role in deriving an
   accurate viscoplastic constitutive law for the thermo-mechanical process
   during cooling from solidification.

AB Ni-based single crystalline superalloys are used for high-pressure parts
   of aero-engines due to their superior mechanical properties and very
   good oxidation resistance at high temperature. However, shocks or
   unexpected mismatch in thermal contraction between molds and castings
   can occur during casting process and subsequent heat treatments,
   inducing plastic deformation of the alloy at low temperature. To mimic
   such events, a tensile plastic deformation is applied at room
   temperature on solutioned AM1 specimens and followed by standard aging
   heat treatments. Faster growth of the gamma' precipitates inside
   plastically deformed bands is obtained after full heat treatment with no
   lattice rotation or recrystallization. It has however been evidenced
   that the applied deformation has a detrimental impact on the creep
   properties, especially at high temperature (above 950 degrees C). It
   partly results from a highly localized failure process along former slip
   bands in which recrystallization is observed. The evolution of the
   microstructure during creep tests of prior deformed and nondeformed
   specimens has been thoroughly investigated to better identify under
   which conditions recrystallization occurs inside the bands during a
   creep test and by which mechanism.

   (EBSD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) technique. The results
   suggest that discontinuous dynamic recrystallization (DDRX),

   that is as a result of the continuous original boundary migration
   induced the increased grain size as well as decreased dislocation
   substructures and subgrain boundaries, is identified by microstructural

   relatively low deformation temperatures, the movement and rearrangement
   of dislocations in original grains as well as the migration of DRX grain
   boundaries are hindered by the presence of gamma' precipitates,
   indicating that DDRX and particle-induced continuous dynamic
   recrystallization (PI-CDRX) can occur simultaneously.

   (iii) simultaneous transient liquid phase (TLP) bonding between wires

   to create a single-phase solid solution, and (v) aging to precipitate
   the gamma' phase. The creep behavior of these 3D-woven gamma/gamma'
   nickel-based superalloys is studied under uniaxial compression via
   experiments at 825 degrees C and via finite element (FE) analysis, using
   a 3D model of the woven structures obtained through X-ray
   micro-tomography. The creep strain rate for the woven Ni-based
   superalloy is higher than that for the bulk superalloy due to the lower
   solid volume fraction of the woven structure, while the creep exponents
   are identical. The compressive creep behavior is sensitive to the
   geometry of the woven structures: fewer wires perpendicular to the load
   and fewer bonds between wires cause lower creep resistance of the woven
   structure, due to a reduction in load transfer from the longitudinal
   wires (which are primarily load-bearing) and the perpendicular wires.
   Creep buckling of longitudinal wires drastically reduces creep
   resistance of the woven structure, confirming the importance of
   maintaining longitudinal wires vertical and parallel to the uniaxial
   compression direction. Finally, reducing wire cross-section, e.g., via
   oxidation, reduces creep resistance. The oxidation kinetics of the wire
   structures at 750, 825, and 900 degrees C displayed parabolic rate
   constants comparable to commercial Ni-based superalloys, but indicates
   that up to 35% of the wire cross-section is oxidized after 7 days at 825
   degrees C, such that oxidation-resistant coatings are needed for
   long-term use in oxidative environment. (C) 2018 Acta Materialia Inc.

AB Hastelloy X is the trademark for a nickel-based, high-temperature
   superalloy that is increasingly applied in gas turbine engines because
   of its exceptional combination of oxidation resistance and
   high-temperature strength. The superalloy suffers from hot cracking
   susceptibility, however, particularly when processed using additive
   manufacturing and laser powder bed fusion (LPBF). This paper
   systematically studies for the first time the effect of post-treatment
   hot isostatic processing (HIP) on the microstructure and mechanical
   properties of LPBF-fabricated Hastelloy X, with an emphasis on fatigue
   performance. The experimental results demonstrate that despite the very
   small number of remaining gas-filled micropores due to pressure
   counteraction, the high temperature and high pressure during the HIP
   process promote recrystallisation and closing of the internal
   microcracks and gas-free pores. The HIP-processed specimens are shown to
   be roughly 130 MPa and 60 MPa weaker than the non processed specimens in
   yield strength and ultimate tensile strength, respectively. The
   HIP-processed Hastelloy X exhibits significant improvements in fatigue
   life, however: the effect of the HIP processing is apparent once the
   applied stress decreases. This improvement in fatigue performance is
   attributable to the reduction in stress concentration and residual
   stress release caused by the HIP process. The paper also studies the hot
   cracking mechanism and finds that intergranular microcracks generally
   occur along high angle grain boundaries; the interdendritic liquid
   pressure drop between dendrite tip and root is found to be a significant
   factor in the hot crack mechanism. The significance of this research is
   in developing a comprehensive understanding of HIP processing on the
   fatigue behaviour of the LPBF-fabricated Hastelloy X. The insights on
   the cracking mechanism, which presents a significant step towards using
   additive manufacturing to produce complex crack-free parts from this

   about 14 and 9%, respectively. Grain size refinement up to similar to 50
   nm after the UNSM process is found to be responsible for the increase in
   surface hardness as well. The depth of the effective layer generated by
   the UNSM process was about 20 mu m. It was concluded that the UNSM
   process played a vital role in increasing the strength and enhancing the
   corrosion and fretting resistances of Alloy 718.

AB Effects of initial microstructures on the Portevin-Le Chatelier effect
   (PLC) and mechanical properties of a Ni-Fe-Cr-base superalloy are
   investigated by hot tensile deformation tests. The inverse PLC effect
   only occurs in the ST (solution treated) and SAT (solution plus phases
   aging precipitation) superalloys when the deformation temperature is
   above 873K. Effects of initial microstructures on the temperature range
   of PLC effect are obvious, that is, the narrowest temperature range for
   the HS (solution plus / phases aging precipitation) superalloy, while
   the widest temperature range for the ST superalloy. The average
   activation energy for type A/A+B/B serrations can be determined as
   65-81kJmol(-1), which contributes to the migration of carbon atoms
   through pipe diffusion. Meanwhile, the average activation energy for
   type C serration is about 132-175kJmol(-1), which is induced by the pipe
   diffusion of substitutional atoms. An obvious increase in the yield
   strength with increasing the deformation temperature from 900 to 973K is
   observed for the ST and SAT superalloys. Also, the negative strain rate
   sensitivity is found in the PLC effect regime. The ST and HS superalloys
   exhibit the ductile fracture. However, a mixture of ductile
   transgranular and cleavage fracture is observed in the SAT superalloy.

AB Corrosion resistance of Inconel 625 Ni-based superalloy was studied in a
   molten nitrate salt consisting of 40 KNO3-60 NaNO3 (wt%) at 500 and 600
   A degrees C. Open-circuit potential, potentiodynamic polarization,
   electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and gravimetric tests were used
   to evaluate the degradation mechanism and corrosion behavior of the
   alloy. Surface morphology and chemical analysis of corrosion products
   were characterized by means of scanning electron microscopy and
   energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry. The weight-loss curves showed that
   with the increase in temperature, the oxidation rate and mass gain
   increased; the relationship between the mass gain and time was close to
   the parabolic oxidation law. The electrochemical corrosion results
   confirmed that during the exposure of Inconel 625 alloy to the molten
   salts, nickel dissolves as a result of non-protective NiO layer formed.
   The formation of a non-protective oxide layer with low barrier property
   was responsible for observing the weak corrosion resistance of the alloy
   at high temperatures (500 and 600 A degrees C). Cyclic polarization
   tests showed a positive hysteresis confirming the nucleation and growth
   of stable pits on the surface of Inconel 625 at high anodic
   overpotentials. Sodium nitrite acts as an efficient pitting inhibitor
   for this case. In this way, the sodium nitrite with the concentration of
   0.1 molal was found to have an optimum inhibition effect on pit
   nucleation at 600 A degrees C.

AB In order to study dynamic recrystallization behavior of the as-extruded
   3Cr20Ni10W2 under isothermal compression conditions, a cellular
   automaton (CA) model was applied to simulate hot compression. Analysis
   on the strain-stress curves indicates that dynamic recrystallization is
   the main softening mechanism for the 3Cr20Ni10W2 when the deformation
   occurred in the temperature range of 1203-1303 K with an interval of 50
   K and strain rate range of 0.01-10 s(-1). The deformation temperature
   and strain rate have a significant influence on the dynamically
   recrystallized grain size. Subsequently, a CA model is established to
   simulate the dynamic recrystallization behaviors of the studied alloy.
   The simulated results show that the mean grain size increases with the
   increased deformation temperature and decreases with the increased
   strain rate, which is consistent with the experimental result. In
   addition, the average absolute relative error, which is 13.14%,
   indicates that the process of the dynamic recrystallization and the
   dynamically recrystallized grain size can be well predicted by the
   present CA model.

   Laves phase dissolves and is replaced by delta-phase in the

   the interdendritic regions. However, the gamma '' precipitates seems to
   be less developed in the dendritic core as compared to the

   attributed to a heterogeneous distribution of Nb in the microstructure,
   with a lower Nb content in the dendritic core as compared to close to

   rupture life. The results showed that the viscosity of superalloy
   decreased but the surface tension increased with increasing superheating
   temperature. Two characteristic temperature points where the melt
   viscosity and undercooling degree suddenly change were determined to be
   1600 A degrees C and 1700 A degrees C, respectively. Similarly, the
   stability of the solidification interface firstly improved and then
   weakened with increasing superheating temperature. The dendrite arms
   were well refined and the segregation was reduced at 1700 A degrees C.
   In addition, the rupture life obtained at 1100 A degrees C and 137 MPa
   increased by approximately 30 pct, approaching the rupture life of the
   corresponding superalloy containing 2 pct Ru, with increasing
   superheating temperature from 1500 A degrees C to 1700 A degrees C. When
   the melt was further heated to 1800 A degrees C, the rupture life
   decreased. The evolutions of solidification characteristics and rupture
   life with increasing melt superheating temperature were attributed to
   changes in the melt structure.

AB Selective laser melting of nickel based superalloys opens up new
   possibilities for gas turbine engine manufacturers; namely, efficient
   production of low component volumes, decreased component cost through
   reduced post-machining procedures and access to new component geometries
   that cannot be fabricated by conventional processing methods. However,
   processing high performance nickel-based superalloys components via
   additive manufacturing, without the occurrence of defects, is
   challenging and requires a better understanding of the resulting
   microstructure, especially as different compositions can lead to
   significant changes in the microstructure obtained. In addition,
   carefully selected post-processing heat-treatments are required to alter
   the microstructure and attain the required mechanical properties. In
   this study, the microstructure of the nickel base superalloy IN738LC has
   been characterised in the as-deposited and stress relieved heat-treated
   states, as well as following high temperature heat treatments. The data
   acquired highlights the influence of the stress relief step on the
   recrystallisation temperature and its relation with the distribution of
   carbide particles present in the alloy's microstructure.

AB The benefits of additive manufacturing have been well documented, but
   prior to these materials being used in critical applications, the
   deformation mechanisms must be properly characterized. In this work, the
   role of heat treatment and build orientation of selective laser melting
   IN718 is investigated through detailed characterization. The
   microstructure of this material is probed through a combination of
   electron microscopy to identify the precipitate structure, electron
   backscatter diffraction to quantify the grain-level features, and
   synchrotron-based X-ray microcomputed tomography to detect porosity. A
   high degree of porosity is observed spatially near the free surface of
   the part, where the contour during the build process meets the interior
   hatch. Further, microstructure based deformation mechanisms are explored
   through digital image correlation relative to the grain features after
   monotonic and cyclic loading and in situ high-energy X-ray diffraction
   to identify the lattice strain evolution in these materials.
   Demarcations between the behaviors of the as-built versus post-processed
   materials are discussed; specifically, in terms of anisotropy with
   respect to build direction and values of the strength properties, based
   on the grain morphology, coherent twin formation, and precipitate
   structure. Lastly, the presence of dislocation sub-structures within the
   grains is observed to homogenize deformation within the asbuilt sample,
   while strain partitioning is observed during loading of the
   post-processed sample.

   accompanied by limited continuous dynamic recrystallization and static
   recrystallization, which lead to a remarkable increase in the fraction
   of low-angle grain boundaries (LAGBs) and a dramatic decrease of the

   were increased by addition of Re, W, and Ru (the effect increased in
   that order). Addition of Mo decreased the melting temperature. W was
   effective as a strengthening element because it acted as a solid
   solution strengthener and increased the fraction of fine
   gamma'-precipitates, thus improving precipitation strengthening.
   Experimentally determined values were compared with calculated values
   based on the CALPHAD software tools Thermo-Calc (databases: TTNI8 and

   large deviation remained between the experiment results and calculations
   based on this database. It also erroneously predicted gamma'-phase

AB Selective laser melting is gaining interest in the aerospace industry as
   a candidate for manufacturing flight hardware. With increasing
   popularity comes the need for rigorous qualification standards and a
   thorough understanding of how processing parameters can affect part
   quality. One such parameter is the laser focal shift, which moves the
   building plane relative to the focal plane of the laser. Changing the
   focal shift alters the power density while keeping the laser parameters
   constant, a novel method for tailoring the microstructures of parts made
   by SLM. In this study, samples were manufactured at different focal
   positions and their microstructures were characterized. Samples built at
   the focal plane had a finer microstructure than samples built away from
   it, a result of higher power density and a smaller spot size.
   Furthermore, samples in the heat-treated condition produced at the
   shifted locations exhibited coarser grains aligned parallel to the build
   direction, while those at the focal plane had a finer and more equiaxed
   microstructure. Differences originating from the as-built condition that
   remain through post processing may influence the final mechanical
   performance of SLM parts. Utilizing the focus shift to produce these
   changes presents a unique opportunity for microstructural tailoring and

AB Nickel Superalloy 718 was specially designed for high temperatures.
   However, due to an embrittlement phenomenon, its application is limited
   up to 650 degrees C. This work presents a contribution to the
   understanding of the embrittlement mechanism focusing on the crack
   propagation kinetics responsible for the brittle fracture. This
   manifestation is known as OAIC (Oxidation Assisted Intergranular
   Cracking), although the phenomenology resulting in such degradation is
   not well understood. The approach to the problem was accomplished in the
   solubilized condition by mechanical testing, fractography and activation
   energy calculation. Generally, high temperature dissociation of NbC in
   the presence of oxygen is pointed as the source of niobium that
   ultimately lead to fracture by Nb2O5 formation at grain boundaries.
   However, metallographic analysis of fractured samples between 600 and
   925 degrees C at different strain rates indicated otherwise. Samples
   tested at 850 degrees C showed minimum ductility and fast intergranular
   crack propagation, at a short time incompatible with carbide
   dissociation and Nb2O5 formation. Furthermore, there is no evidence of
   sufficient NbC along grain boundaries to supply elemental niobium to the
   formation of the Nb2O5 continuous film. Besides, onset to OAIC as a
   function of temperature and strain rate led to a 223 kJ/mol activation
   energy, which can be associated to niobium self diffusion within the
   matrix. Considering that the dynamic aging phenomenon and the gamma ''
   precipitation occur concomitantly with the deformation, the results
   suggest that niobium segregation together with preferential gamma ''
   precipitation at grain boundary and the consequent stress state build up
   should play also a decisive role in the embrittlement. (C) 2018

AB Generally, the high-temperature deformation characteristics and
   microstructural evolution of alloys are studied by isothermal
   compressive experiments at stable strain rates. But, the strain rate is
   variant during the practice industrial production of components. In this
   work, isothermal two-pass hot compression experiments with stepped
   strain rates are performed to analyze the microstructural evolution of a
   nickel-base superalloy with phase. Results reveal that the mean grain
   size decreases, but the percentage of undissolved phases increases, as
   the strain rate of the first pass (SROFP) is increased. However, the
   mean grain size and the percentage of undissolved phases decreases with
   the increase of inter-pass time (IPT) or the true strain of the first
   pass (TSOFP). Meanwhile, the increased deformation temperature easily
   enlarges the mean grain size, but obviously decreases the percentage of
   undissolved phases. In addition, the evolution of sigma 3(n) boundaries
   not only results from the new twinning mechanism, but also sigma 3(n)
   regeneration mechanism. sigma 3(n) regeneration mechanism becomes
   predominant with decreasing SROFP or increasing IPT/TSOFP. Besides, new
   twinning mechanism plays a major role on sigma 3(n) boundaries evolution
   as the temperature is increased from 950 to 980 degrees C, and then
   become weaken with further increasing the deformation temperature.

AB The recrystallization (RX) behavior of superalloy during standard
   solution heat treatment (SSHT) varies significantly with deformation
   temperature. Single-crystal (SX) samples of Ni-base superalloy were
   compressed to 5% plastic deformation at room temperature (RT) and 980
   degrees C, and the deformed samples were then subjected to SSHT process
   which consists of 1290 degrees C/1 h, 1300 degrees C/2 h, and 1315
   degrees C/4 h, air cooling. RT-deformed samples showed almost no RX
   grains until the annealing temperature was elevated to 1315 degrees C,
   while 980 degrees C-deformed samples showed a large number of RX grains
   in the initial stage of SSHT. It is inferred that the strengthening
   effect of gamma' phases and the stacking faults in them increase the
   driving force of RX for 980 degrees C-deformed samples. The RX grains
   nucleate and grow in dendritic arms preferentially when the
   microstructural inhomogeneity is not completely eliminated by SSHT. A
   model coupling crystal plasticity finite element method (CPFEM) and
   cellular automaton (CA) method was proposed to simulate the RX evolution
   during SSHT. One ({111} <110>) and three ({111} <110>, {100} <110>,
   {111} <112>) slip modes were assumed to be activated at RT and 980
   degrees C in CPFEM calculations, respectively. The simulation takes the
   inhomogeneous as-cast dendritic microstructure into consideration. The
   simulated RX morphology and density conform well to experimental
   results.

AB Study on semi-solid processing of superalloy is little reported due to
   the difficulties in fabricating semi-solid billets. In this manuscript,
   a novel method called semi-solid isothermal treatment of wrought
   superalloy (SSITWS) was firstly proposed in order to fabricate
   semi-solid billets of superalloy. The effects of isothermal temperature
   and soaking time on microstructure of Ni-based superalloy GH4037 in the
   semi-solid state were investigated. The results show that the
   near-globular microstructure of wrought GH4037 superalloy can be
   obtained by the semi-solid isothermal treatment. The average grain size
   increased and the roundness decreased with the prolonged soaking time at
   1350 degrees C and 1360 degrees C. When the isothermal temperature was
   elevated to 1370 degrees C or 1380 degrees C, the microstructure
   evolution was complex due to the combination of breaking up mechanism
   and coarsening mechanism. At 1390 degrees C, the dendritic grains were
   obviously observed in the microstructure. With the increasing of
   isothermal temperature and soaking time, the liquid boundary film
   coarsening behavior occurred in the microstructure. With the increasing
   of soaking time, the size of intragranular liquid droplets increased,
   but the amount of them decreased. When the isothermal temperature was
   high, the intragranular liquid droplets disappeared. The coarsening rate
   constant at 1360 degrees C was lower compared to that at 1350 degrees C.
   However, when the isothermal temperature was higher than 1370 degrees C,
   the coarsening kinetics was not suitable for describing the
   microstructure evolution. The discrete carbide precipitates appeared in
   the grain boundaries. The distribution of Ti and Mo were higher in the
   grain boundaries than that in solid grains, and the distribution of
   other elements was homogenous in the grain boundaries and inside the
   grains.

AB Based on its excellent high-temperature performances, polycrystalline
   Ni3Al-based alloys have attracted more and more attention. In this work,
   different thermal cycle aging treatments (TCAT) were applied to
   investigate microstructure evolution behavior of Ni3Al (gamma') phase in
   eutectic gamma-gamma' area of JG4246A alloy. SEM equipped with energy
   dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS) and high-resolution transmission
   electron microscopy (HRTEM) were used for microstructure observation and
   mechanism analysis. The results showed that plate-like Ni3Al (gamma')
   phase and twinning Ni3Al (gamma') formed in eutectic gamma-gamma' area
   due to its initial state of the alloy and thermal cyclic aging treatment
   conditions. Meanwhile, blocky Ni3Al (gamma') phase precipitated along
   eutectic gamma-gamma' area and dual phase (gamma + gamma') area
   ((gamma-gamma')/(gamma-gamma')) interfaces. Vacancies and dislocations
   generated during short-term TCAT were responsible for the formation of
   plate-like Ni3Al (gamma') phases in eutectic gamma-gamma' area of
   as-cast alloy. While, for the solution-treated alloy, dislocations and
   internal stress generated during long-term TCAT led to the formation of
   twinning Ni3Al (gamma') in eutectic gamma-gamma' area and blocky Ni3Al
   (y') phase along (gamma-gamma')/(gamma + gamma) interface.

AB The incremental nature deformation of the rotary forging has great
   influence on the microstructure evolution during hot working achieving
   an instant recrystallisation from the beginning and reducing the forming
   force and obtaining higher deformation proportions compared with
   conventional forging operation. Mechanical properties of the
   nickel-based superalloy are sensitive to the grain size, which, in turn,
   is altered by the forging temperature, strain rate, strain and
   metallurgical phenomena. In order to get a better understanding of the
   influence of the incremental deformation on the microstructure
   evolution, a numerical model to forge a nickel-based superalloy disc has
   been developed into finite element platform, DEFORM (TM) 3D. The
   deformation characteristic of the workpiece was defined and processing
   parameters such as friction coefficient, workpiece preheating, tool
   temperature and cooling impact were studied, to relate the
   microstructural behaviour. The study of the grain size control has been
   carried out considering fine and coarse initial grain size coupling a
   phenomenological model into a finite element code. A fully
   recrystallised microstructure was obtained with a standard deviation of
   0.5 mu m; the simulated grain size was compared with experimental

AB This study consists of assessing the influence of ageing heat treatments
   on characteristics of the microstructure and the hardness in the
   Inconel-713C nickel-based superalloy. The ageing process including the
   time and the temperature was modified based on the material hardness, by
   the design of experiments (DOE). For this objective, ageing treatments
   consisted of heating at 850, 890 and 930 A degrees C for 8 and 16 h,
   after a solutioning treatment. Experimental results showed that the mean
   hardness reached the highest value (as 43.2 RC) in the sample that was
   age-hardened at 890 A degrees C for 8 h, without requiring usual double
   ageing heat treatments. Besides, the DOE also predicted the highest
   hardness, which would be related to the specimen, hardened at 896.1 A
   degrees C for 8 h and also 895.3 A degrees C for 16 h, based on vertical
   and parallel lines, respectively. The highest hardness was associated
   with the optimum volume fraction (as 64%) of approximately fine size (as
   500 nm) of precipitates. Besides, M23C6-type carbides plus NbC had a
   positive effect to enhance the hardness value. X-ray diffraction (XRD)
   results indicated various phases created in different ageing heat
   treatments that affected the hardness.

AB The relationships between hot deformation parameters and flow behaviour
   have attracted many researchers' attention for the past few decades,
   whilst precise constitutive modelling of GH4169 remained a problem,
   which seriously affected the process and microstructure control of
   alloys. In this work, a modified Arrhenius type model was introduced to
   describe the flow stresses of various compression conditions. The model
   showed high precision in flow stress prediction. In order to facilitate
   workability evaluation for engineering applications, the hot processing
   maps were established at the strain of 0.4 similar to 0.6. The
   processing maps revealed an instability domain at 900 similar to 950
   degrees C and 0.1 similar to 1 s(-1), a high dissipation efficiency
   domain at 1060 similar to 1100 degrees C and 0.001 similar to 0.01
   s(-1), and a stable deformation domain for the rest of processing
   parameters. Microstructures of each domain were observed via optical
   microscope (OM) and electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD). The
   intriguing finding was that the microstructures morphology agreed well
   with the descriptions in discontinuous mechanism, and incompletely
   recrystallized microstructures were found in the instability domain.
   Fully recrystallized microstructures were found in the stable
   deformation domain, and grain coarsen in the high dissipation efficiency
   domain. Optimal hot working conditions were suggested based on the
   microstructure analysis. This investigation contributed to a
   comprehensive understanding of the workability of GH4169.

   NiCoCrAlY coatings with and without the diffusion barrier were
   evaluated. Thermal shock resistance was investigated by quenching the
   coated samples in cold water from the temperature of 1100 degrees C.
   Also, the capability of Re-Ni as the diffusion barrier layer was
   investigated by isothermal oxidation at 1100 degrees C. The results
   showed that application of the thin interlayer of Re-Ni as a diffusion
   barrier beneath the NiCoCrAlY coating could slightly decrease the
   thermal shock and the adhesion strength of the NiCoCrAlY coating. The
   thermal expansion coefficient mismatch between the Re-Ni diffusion
   barrier and the NiCoCrAlY coating and the reduction of the substrate
   surface roughness due to Re-Ni deposition were the two main mechanisms
   limiting the lifetime of the NiCoCrAlY coating. But with significant
   improvement in oxidation resistance, these limitations could be
   compensated.

   an increase in the Cr content from 21.1 to 23.5 at.%, plate-like sigma
   (sigma) and alpha-Cr phases formed during the thermal exposure. These
   phases were mainly located in the interdendritic areas and grew
   significantly as the thermal exposure time increased. The coarsening
   process of the gamma' phase obeyed the Lifshitz, Slyozov, and Wagner
   (LSW) model, and the gamma' particles maintained a coherent relationship
   with the gamma matrix during the thermal exposure. Carbides (M23C6)
   formed and coarsened at the grain boundaries, and their distribution
   gradually transformed from discontinuous to continuous during the
   thermal exposure. The evolutions of the gamma' phase and M23C6 carbides
   were not significantly affected by the Cr-content variation. As the
   thermal exposure time increased, the room-temperature impact toughness
   degraded significantly, and a ductile (intragranular)/brittle (mixed
   intergranular and intragranular) transition occurred. The degradation of
   impact toughness mainly occurred due to coarsening of the M23C6 carbides
   along the grain boundaries and the growth of plate-like phases (sigma,

   In this study tapered slots with maximum 200 mu m width were

   diffusion brazing with a mixed filler alloy at 1100 degrees C for 24 h
   and followed by homogenization at temperatures of 1160 degrees C (HT-1),
   1180 degrees C (HT-2) and 1190 degrees C (HT-3). With increasing
   homogenization temperature and time, the volume faction of borides in
   diffusion affected zone (DAZ) decreased. During the homogenization with
   HT-3, most of the borides in the DAZ of the joint dissolved, merely a
   small quantity of others coarsened by Ostwald ripening. In order of the
   processes as-bonded, HT-1, HT-2 and HT-3, the chemical composition of
   the isothermal solidification zones (ISZs) gradually came close to that
   of the base metal and the hardness of the ISZs increased, while the
   hardness of the DAZs decreased. A uniform bonded joint could be obtained
   with HT-3, and the shear strength of the joint reached up to
   approximately 95% of the base metal. The corresponding fracture path and
   fractography of the samples were observed to explain the mechanism of

AB Hot working is a key process in the production of superalloys; however,

   performance. Therefore, the effects of hot working on inclusions in a

   by vacuum induction melting and vacuum arc remelting. Hot working was
   performed by unidirectional drawing, upsetting and drawing, and
   upsetting/drawing with radial forging. The types and distributions of
   inclusions after these three hot working processes and those in an
   original ingot were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy, energy
   dispersive spectroscopy, and Image-Pro Plus software. The results showed
   that the melting technology essentially determined the inclusion types
   in GH4738. Four types of inclusions were found in the experiments:
   TiC-TiN-Mo-S composite, TiC-TiN composite, Ce-Mo-S composite, and SiC
   inclusions. In the case of hot working by unidirectional drawing, the
   average inclusion size first decreased, and then increased from the
   center to the edge. In the case of upsetting and drawing, and
   upsetting/drawing with radial forging, the average inclusion size
   decreased from the center to the edge.

   Post-processing involved several heat treatments and a combination of
   hot isostatic pressing (HIP) and solution treatment and aging (STA) to
   homogenize the microstructure. The experimental results showed that the
   originally recommended heat treatment process, STA-980 degrees C, for
   cast and wrought materials was not effective for SLM-processed
   specimens. Obvious grain growth structures were obtained in the STA-1180
   degrees C/1 h and STA-1180 degrees C/4 h specimens. However, the grain
   size was uneven since heavy distortion or high-density dislocation
   formed during the SLM process, which would be harmful for the mechanical
   properties of SLM-fabricated materials. The HIP+ direct aging process
   was the most effective method among the post-processes to improve the
   creep behavior at 650 degrees C. The creep rupture life of the HIP+
   direct aging condition approached 800 h since the HIP process had the
   benefit of being free of pores, thus preventing microcrack nucleation
   and the formation of a serrated grain boundary.

AB The present study was aimed at determining the surface strain/stress
   state in an Ni-based single-crystal (SC) superalloy that was subjected
   to two different cooling rates from solid solution temperature through
   using the X- ray diffraction (XRD) method. The normal stresses
   sigma(s)(11) and sigma(s)(22) were determined, then the Von Mises
   stresses (sigma(s)(VM)) were derived from them. Field emission gun
   scanning electron microscope (FEG-SEM) and transmission electron
   microscope (TEM) micrographs were taken to illustrate the strain/stress
   state change. The precipitation of the secondary gamma' phases in the
   gamma phase and the formation of the dislocation in the interphase upon
   a slower cooling rate caused the gamma phase lattice distortion to
   increase, so a larger sigma(s)(VM) of the gamma phase was realized in
   comparison to the faster cooling sample. For both of the two cooling
   modes, we found that the sigma(s)(VM) of the gamma' phase increased due
   to the growth of the gamma' phase during the aging process. Also, the
   aging process led to pronouncedly anisotropic lattice mismatches in the
   {331} and {004} planes. In addition, the surface strain/stress states of
   a cylinder sample and a tetragonal sample were also studied using a
   faster cooling rate, and sigma(s)(11) and sigma(s)(22) were analyzed to
   explain the influence of the shape factor on the stress anisotropy in
   the [001] and [1 (1) over bar0] orientations. The strain in the [001]
   orientation of the gamma phase is more sensitive to the shape change.

AB The properties of nickel-base superalloy pipes are determined by
   microstructure, and the microstructure can be tuned by hot extrusion
   process. There are two major questions in hot extrusion: one is how to
   successfully extrude pipes without apparent defects, the other is how to
   make the microstructure under control. However, up to now, there is no
   systematical report about hot extrusion process and microstructure
   control for nickel-base superalloys. In present study, a series of
   technical control principles for hot extrusion are proposed basing on
   practical manufacture facts, large amounts of experimental studies and
   finite element simulation of several typical nickel-base superalloys.
   The common used technical control principles can be applied for hot
   extrusion parameters determination to maintain safety hot extrusion and
   microstructure control. In the investigation of microstructure control
   based hot extrusion principles, the action rules of different working
   parameters on hot extrusion field quantities were established. The upper
   and lower limits of different principles were obtained in consideration
   of materials characteristics and extruder conditions. The limitations
   were overlapped on the action rules to determine the optimized hot
   extrusion parameters. The microstructure-based control principle
   proposed in present work can provide theoretical guidance for hot
   extrusion parameter determination and optimization.

AB K417 superalloy castings with different addition of rare earth element Y
   were produced by vacuum induction melting technology using Y2O3
   crucibles under different vacuum degrees. The effects and interaction
   mechanisms of Y and vacuum degree on the purification of the superalloy
   were investigated. The results showed that high purification of K417
   superalloy with 4 similar to 5 ppm O and N was obtained after addition
   of Y. There was a characteristic transition during the deoxidation and
   denitrogenation of the superalloy when the vacuum degree changed. With
   the addition of 0.5 wt% Y in the alloy, the concentration of O could be
   reduced from 34 ppm to 8 ppm in rough vacuum and from 13 ppm to 4 ppm in
   high vacuum, respectively. High vacuum enhanced the chemical dissolution
   of Y2O3 crucible. The concentration of N decreased from 43 ppm to 14 ppm
   with the addition of Y in rough vacuum condition of 100Pa. Whereas, in
   high vacuum condition of 0.035Pa, the concentration of N tend to
   increase from 4 ppm to 7 ppm. The effect of deoxidation of Y promoted
   the process of denitrogenation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB The effects of boron and zirconium additives on the wrought structural
   characteristics of the nickel-based superalloy ATI 718Plus, including
   grain size, delta and gamma' phases, and gamma-gamma' misfit were
   investigated. For this purpose, five alloys with different contents of
   boron (0.00-0.016 wt%) and zirconium (0.0 -0.1 wt%) were cast via the
   VIM and then purified via the VAR. After the rolling process and the
   heat treatment cycles, the microstructural investigation by OM,
   FESEM-EDS and phase analysis by the XRD analysis was performed. Although
   the results indicated that boron and zirconium had a slight effect on
   the reduction of grain size, delta phase was increased by 41% and 50% in
   the presence of these elements, respectively. In fact, boron and
   zirconium decreased in time and increased the temperature of delta phase
   nucleation by shifting the nose of the TTP diagram obtained for that to
   the upper left. The XRD analysis results revealed an increase in the
   lattice constant of the gamma and gamma' phases as well as constrained
   and unconstrained lattice misfit of them in the presence of boron and
   zirconium. The maximum gamma-gamma' misfit was determined for the alloy
   with the maximum boron and zirconium content (16 B100Z) as -0.3424
   (constrained) and -0.9821 (unconstrained). In addition, the coherent
   elastic strain between gamma and gamma' phases, increased to a higher
   positive value in the presence of these elements. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

   Ni-CrSi-Fe-B filler metals with 50 and 100 mu m thicknesses. The
   microstructure, shear strength, and micro hardness of the resultant
   joints were investigated. The results showed that the complete
   isothermal solidification occurred after 300 min for both the filler
   metal thicknesses. The presence of eutectic phases and cavities in the
   interlayer and non-dissolved carbides in the diffusion affected zone
   were the main reasons for the reduction in the shear strength. By
   increasing the holding time, the carbides were dissolved and the
   hardness of the diffusion affected zone was reduced. The highest shear
   strength was obtained for the 50 mu m thick interlayer and 300 min
   holding time (with about 96% joint efficiency). (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The grain boundary character distribution (GBCD) has been studied in low
   stacking-fault energy (SFE) alloys, due to the formation of coherent and
   incoherent annealing twins through a combination of cold deformation and
   annealing, inducing the formation of low energy Sigma 3n boundaries, as
   well as the break of the connectivity of the random boundaries. This
   mechanism is based on grain boundary mobility, leading to grain growth.
   This poses a problem when a refined microstructure is required. The
   delta phase can be induced for grain refining by a controlled
   precipitation during solution annealing. Therefore, the objective of
   this work is to investigate the effect of the delta phase precipitation
   on the development of the GBCD and its influence on grain size. Four
   processing routes were used, combining cold rolling with
   sub-delta-solvus solution annealing. The results show that a high
   proportion of Sigma 3n boundaries was achieved, concomitantly with a
   refined microstructure. The delta phase had an important effect on grain
   refinement, but not affecting markedly the formation of the Sigma 3n
   boundaries during processing. Likewise, this phase also had influence on
   alloy strength, while the formation of the Sigma 3n boundaries had a
   strong influence on the elongation-to-failure.

AB Dynamic strain aging (DSA), observed macroscopically as serrated plastic
   flow, has long been seen in nickel-base superalloys when plastically
   deformed at elevated temperatures. Here we report the absence of DSA in
   Inconel 625 made by additive manufacturing (AM) at temperatures and
   strain rates where DSA is present in its conventionally processed
   counterpart. This absence is attributed to the unique AM microstructure
   of finely dispersed secondary phases (carbides, N-rich phases, and Laves
   phase) and textured grains. Based on experimental observations, we
   propose a dislocation-arrest model to elucidate the criterion for DSA to
   occur or to be absent as a competition between dislocation pipe
   diffusion and carbide-carbon reactions. With in situ neutron diffraction
   studies of lattice strain evolution, our findings provide a new
   perspective for mesoscale understanding of dislocation-solute
   interactions and their impact on work-hardening behaviors in
   high-temperature alloys, and have important implications for tailoring
   thermomechanical properties by microstructure control via AM.

AB Inconel 718 fabricated by selective laser melting (SLM) was used to
   investigate the evolution of grain boundary (GB) network structures from
   as-SLM to heat-treated (HT) samples. Using electron backscatter
   diffraction (EBSD) data and percolation theory based cluster analysis,
   GB character distribution and GB network topological metrics were
   computed at different build locations and directions. The
   microstructures of the as-SLM samples reveal large spatial heterogeneity
   in grain morphology and are dominated by general GBs (i.e., Sigma > 29),
   which form one connected cluster spanning across the whole GB network.
   Heat-treatment homogenizes the microstructure and leads to the formation
   of annealing twins as a result of recrystallization, which dramatically
   increases the number of special boundaries (mainly twin Sigma 3 and
   twin-related Sigma 9, Sigma 27 boundaries with similar to 60% in
   boundary length fraction). However, these special boundaries have not
   yet fully connected/merged to form a percolated path throughout the GB
   network. The triple junction distributions of the HT sample are
   dominated by J(1)-type that consists of one special and two general
   boundaries, further confirming the interweaving GB network made of the
   general and special boundary clusters. In addition, the implication of
   applying GB engineering to the SLMed parts is discussed based on the
   comparison of GB network structures between the SLMed alloys and the
   conventionally GB engineered metals and alloys.

   AlCoCrFeNi2.1 elevated temperature has been studied by tensile test,
   microstructure analysis and calculation. The ratio of the FCC and BCC
   phases has changed greatly after deformation. The formation enthalpies
   of L-12-type Ni3Al and B2-type NiAl are calculated by using Miedema
   model. Testing and calculation suggest that B2(II)precipitates (NiAl)
   have a priority in the precipitation order, which is critical to phase
   change. Besides, TEM results reveal that the function of B2(II)
   precipitates in FCC matrix during deformation is similar to Orowan
   by-passing mechanism, and the role of L1(2,II) precipitates in B2 matrix
   is regarded as dislocation cutting. Dynamic recrystallization, occurring
   in the FCC matrix, reduces stress concentration caused by dislocation
   motion, but it may be suppressed by B2(pi) precipitates. It has been
   identified that the softening mechanism of dynamic recrystallization and
   precipitation strengthening have an effect on the high temperature
   deformation process of the AlCoCrFeNi2.1 EHEA.

AB The paper comparatively investigates the microstructures and mechanical

   melting (SLM) and casting. The finite element analysis (FEA) method is
   used to simulate the temperature fields during SLM and casting
   processes. Driven by ultra-high temperature gradient and ultra-fast
   cooling rate during SLM process, the fine grains (average grain size of
   48 mu m) and dispersed fine precipitation in SLM-ed sample even after
   HSA (homogenization + solution + aging) and HA (homogenization + aging)
   heat treatment significantly enhance its mechanical properties, which
   far exceeds that of casting with average grain size of 1300 mu m, and is
   comparable to that of forging. The microstructure of casting with coarse
   irregular Laves phases, acicular delta precipitates and globular
   carbides in the interdendritic zones after HSA heat treatment and some
   defects existed possibly result in premature failure of tensile samples.
   The microstructure without delta phases but only some globular carbides
   in the grain boundary of SLM-ed sample after HA heat treatment possesses
   higher mechanical properties than that after HSA heat treatment, in
   which there is only some finer needle-like delta phase and few carbides
   are precipitated in the grain boundaries. The analysis shows the large
   amounts of delta phase precipitated in the matrix will deteriorate the
   plasticity of SLM-ed IN718 superalloy, the appropriate reduction of the
   delta phase will improve the strength and plasticity of material
   simultaneously.

   transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy-dispersive spectroscopy
   (EDS) and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD). The samples were
   produced with selective laser melting and underwent two different heat
   treatments (stress relieved and fully post-processed) that produced
   different microstructures. The solidification process led to the
   formation of dendrites where misorientation between each branch was
   accommodated with dislocations, producing subgranular cell structures.
   EDS observations revealed that Ti and Nb segregate to the cell and grain
   boundaries, forming carbides. The stress relieved sample retained the
   cell boundaries, which acted as barriers for dislocation propagation,
   thereby distributing strain evenly throughout the microstructure. In
   contrast, the post-processed sample contained no cell boundaries, and
   strain was localized at the grain boundaries. Mechanical tests showed
   that the precipitates and the annealing twins in the post-processed
   sample were much more effective at improving the strength than small
   grain size and cell boundaries found in the stress relieved sample.

AB This study focuses on the microstructure evolution induced by eutectic
   WC-W2C inoculants during the selective laser melting (SLM) of IN718. The
   as-built microstructure observed using an electron microscope indicates
   that grain nucleation occurred on the surface of inoculants and that the
   diffusion layer between inoculants and IN718 composed of a mixture of
   IN718 and inoculants. After the post heat treatment of the as-built SLM
   specimens, more grains nucleated around the inoculants, and Nb-rich
   precipitates were formed along the grain boundaries. With an increase in
   the post heat-treatment temperature, the microstructure evolution became
   more pronounced. To elucidate the underlying mechanism, both theoretical
   and experimental analyses were performed. In summary, eutectic WC-W2C
   inoculants could provide heterogeneous nucleation sites for grain
   formation owing to the low wetting angle and the semi-coherent interface
   with the matrix. Theoretical analysis suggests that the difference in
   the thermal expansion coefficient between inoculants and IN718 did not
   provide a significant amount of residual stress. Thus, it can be
   concluded that heterogeneous nucleation is the primary mechanism by
   which inoculants can influence the microstructure in the present study.

AB The ability to produce metallic membrane materials with porosity on the
   nanoscale from Ni-based superalloys, hitherto used exclusively for high
   temperature applications, has been discovered 15 years ago. The basic
   principle is to first convert the initial / microstructure, containing
   isolated -precipitates, into a bi-continuous network where both phases
   are in themselves continuous and interpenetrate each other. Then, one of
   the two phases is selectively removed, so that a rigid structure
   consisting of the remaining phase with pores on the location of the
   removed phase results. This article reviews the progress made so far. In
   that time period, a number of ways to fabricate these unique materials
   have emerged, utilizing 1) single crystals and polycrystals as precursor
   materials as well as 2) coarsening of coherent and incoherent
   -precipitates to realize bi-continuity of the microstructure.
   Consequently, a family of superalloy membranes has emerged with specific
   microstructures, properties, advantages, and limitations. It is the
   intention of this article to give an overview on these various
   manufacturing routes, as well as on resulting microstructures and
   properties. Finally, possible fields of applications are outlined. It is
   demonstrated that the particular manufacturing process from a solid to
   the porous material leads to certain advantages, such as the ability to
   structure the material in porous and solid areas as required by the
   application.

AB Design and control of microstructure of engineering parts made from
   nickel based superalloys with superior mechanical properties for high
   temperature applications, require the parts to be subjected to certain
   thermo-mechanical processing during forging. This often includes
   sequential straining and annealing at elevated temperatures followed by
   subsequent aging heat treatments at lower temperatures. In this study,
   the effect of strain magnitude on the evolution of microstructure during
   hot forging of a recently developed AD730 nickel based superalloy has
   been investigated. Microstructural heterogeneity was observed in a
   forged material manifested in a form of large non-recrystallized grains
   within the recrystallized Matrix that is observed to be dependent on the
   level of deformation (i.e. strain magnitude). Analyses of microstructure
   indicated significant reduction in the fraction of low-angle grain
   boundaries and sub-structures with an increase in the applied strain,
   suggesting higher fraction of recrystallization with higher levels of
   strains. It was concluded that the lower strain levels were insufficient

AB In this work, a precipitation strengthened high entropy alloy was
   subjected to thermo-mechanical process in order to homogenize the grain
   microstructure. Tensile tests from room temperature to 1000 degrees C
   were conducted; microstructures were observed by scanning electron
   microscope and transmission electron microscope. Formation of cellular
   precipitate along grain boundaries was observed and could be related to
   hot tensile ductility drop at 750 degrees C (1023 K). Experimental
   analysis has indicated that driving force for the formation of cellular
   precipitates could be resulted from the chemical instability of
   supersaturation after annealing and migration of grain boundaries, and
   this phenomenon could be suppressed either through alloy design to
   increase gamma-prime solvus, and to hinder the migration of grain
   boundaries. This study serves as a guideline to design composition and
   thermo-mechanical process for precipitation strengthened high entropy
   alloys. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Generally, the hot deformation behaviors and microstructural evolution
   of alloys are studied by isothermal hot compressive experiments.
   However, in the practice industrial production, the temperature in
   metallic parts is variant in hot forming process. In this study, the
   deformation mechanism and microstructural evolution of a solid-solution
   Ni-Fe-Cr-base superalloy during the non-isothermal two stage hot
   compressive deformation are investigated. Here, the deformation
   temperature of the first stage is 1040 degrees C, while those of the
   second stage are 950, 980, and 1010 degrees C. Meanwhile, the dynamic
   recrystallization (DRX) behaviors and nucleation mechanisms are
   analyzed. It is found that the temperature of the second stage (namely
   the final deformation temperature) has a great impact on the
   microstructures. During the non-isothermal two-stage hot deformation,
   the DRX volume fraction increases as the deformation degree of the first
   stage or the final deformation temperature is increased, or the strain
   rate is decreased. Compared with the isothermal hot deformation, DRX
   behaviors are more obvious during the non-isothermal two-stage hot
   deformation. In addition, DRX nucleation mechanisms mainly consist of
   discontinuous dynamic recrystallization (DDRX) and continuous dynamic
   recrystallization (CDRX) during the non-isothermal two-stage hot
   deformation. Furthermore, DDRX plays the primary role. (C) 2018 Elsevier

AB The purpose of the present work was to investigate the effect of primary
   carbides and the delta-phase on the anisotropic ductile fracture of
   Inconel 718 in the forging process. Inconel 718 alloys were prepared by
   VIM + VAR processes with various carbon contents (0.009 and 0.027 wt.%).
   Then, the alloys were forged and annealed at temperatures of 980 and
   1030 A degrees C. The room temperature mechanical anisotropy of the
   alloys was evaluated at the longitudinal direction (LD) and transverse
   direction (TD). Tensile and impact tests were used to characterize the
   mechanical properties of the specimens. The microstructural
   characterization and the fractography of the alloys were carried out by
   FE-SEM. The obtained results showed that the fracture strain and the
   impact energy in the TD were 30-50% lower than the LD. The fracture was
   accelerated by the delta-phase, leading to the reduction of impact
   energy in the longitudinal and the lateral directions up to 50%. The
   low-carbon alloy indicated similar characteristics in both the LD and
   the TD. Aligned carbides changed the fracture path from a zigzag path in
   the LD to a fibrous path in the TD, while the delta-phase created a flat
   fracture path. The shear lip area ratio in the tensile fracture cross
   section was decreased by reducing ductility.

   temperature) and bright-field image of the microstructures quenched from
   1400 A degrees C have been measured by the high-temperature x-ray
   diffractometer and the transmission electron microscopy (TEM),
   respectively. The results show that a pre-peak exists on a S(Q) curve at
   the liquidus temperature. The clusters of atom in rapidly quenched
   microstructures obtained by isothermal heat treatment at 1400 A degrees
   C were studied using TEM. Meanwhile, the effect of isothermal different
   temperatures on rapidly quenched microstructures was studied. The
   results also show that there are only the globular, equiaxed grains
   distributed in the solidification structure. These particles are
   inherited from the medium-range order structure, which is beneficial for
   grain refinement. The normalized work-hardening rate-strain curve
   indicates the work-hardening rate of fine grain is higher than that of
   conventional grain at the same temperature and the same deformation.

AB This study updates a process of high-pressure sliding (HPS) recently
   developed as a severe plastic deformation process under high pressure
   for grain refinement of sheet samples. The updated version, which we
   call the incremental feeding HPS (IF-HPS), consists of sliding for SPD
   and feeding for upsizing the SPD-processed area so that, without
   increasing the capacity of processing facility, it is possible to cover
   a much larger area with an SPD-processed ultrafine-grained structure
   with a grain size of similar to 120 nm. For the IF-HPS processing,
   anvils with flat surfaces but without grooves are used in an
   unconstrained condition, and the feeding distance is set equal to the
   deformed width. A Ni-based superalloy (Inconel 718) is processed by the
   IF-HPS under 4 GPa at room temperature, and it is possible to obtain an
   SPD-processed sheet with dimensions of approximately 100 x 100 x 1
   mm(3). Strain distribution and evolution were examined by hardness
   measurement and simulation using a finite element method. Tensile tests
   were conducted using tensile specimens extracted from the
   IF-HPS-processed sheet. Advent of high strain rate superplasticity with
   the total elongation of more than 400 pct was confirmed by pulling the
   tensile specimens with an initial strain rate of 2.0 x 10(-2) s(-1) at a
   temperature as low as 1073 K. The formability of the IF-HPS-processed
   sheet was confirmed by successful cup forming. It was also confirmed
   that the restoration after the superplastic deformation was feasible by
   subjecting to conventional heat treatment used for Inconel 718.

AB The hot deformation behavior of fine grained Inconel 718 superalloy was
   investigated by compression test in the temperature range of 950 to 1150
   degrees C and strain rate range of 0.1-10 s(-1). At low temperatures and
   high strain rates, the flow stress rapidly increased to a peak value
   with increasing strain at the initial stage of deformation. After
   attaining peak stress, the flow curves exhibited an obvious phenomenon
   of flow softening. At high temperatures and low strain rates, the flow
   curves exhibited typical characteristics of dynamic recrystallization. A
   strain-compensated Arrhenius type constitutive equation was used to
   predict the flow behavior of the alloy. The relationship between the
   material constants ( i.e. alpha, Q, n and lnA) in Arrhenius-type
   constitutive equation and true strain was established by a fifth order
   polynomial. The flow stress values predicted by the developed
   constitutive equations were in good agreement with the experimental
   values, showing that the developed constitutive equation can give a
   precise estimate for the flow stress during hot deformation. The
   processing maps of fine grained Inconel 718 superalloy for hot working
   at different strains were constructed. The optimum processing parameters
   were determined to be the deformation temperature of 1100 degrees C and
   strain rate of 0.1 s(-1). (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Effect of solution heat treatment on microstructure and electrochemical
   behavior was investigated for the electron beam smelted (EBS) 718
   superalloy. The results imply that the solution heat treatment has a
   great influence on the precipitation behavior of EBS 718 superalloys and
   thus affects the electrochemical behavior. The increase of solution
   temperature gives rise to the solution of delta phase for both solution
   treated and aged EBS 718 superalloys. The 980 degrees C solution treated
   and aged EBS 718 superalloy exhibits the maximum content of the volume
   fraction of gamma '' phase, in parallel with the highest lattice
   misfits. Further increase of solution temperature results in the
   precipitation of dispersively distributed gamma' particles. The pitting
   potential for the solution treated superalloys increases gradually with
   increase of solution temperature, and a similar behavior is observed for
   the aged superalloys with an exception of the alloy processed at 980
   degrees C. The effect of solution temperature on the solution treated
   superalloys can be elucidated by considering the variation of the volume
   fraction and the size of delta precipitates. For the aged superalloys,
   the deterioration effect of Nb rich gamma '' is obvious due to the
   tetragonal distortion and accompanying strain field in the nearby
   matrix. Higher solution temperature results in a uniform distribution of
   the nano-scale gamma' phase and smallest lattice misfits, with the
   highest apparent activation energy derived to be 52.86 kJ/mol. (C) 2018

   was examined using SEM, TEM and HRTEM analysis, and mechanical
   performance was evaluated by a shear test. Prolonged thermal exposure at

   microstructural sensitivity to elevated temperatures. Efforts were made
   to reveal the relationship between the temperature-dependent
   microstructure and mechanical properties. Results indicate that two
   reaction zones (Zones 1 and 2) occur in the joint, with Zone 1 close to
   the Hastelloy N. The microstructure of Zone 1, produced through the
   eutectic melting of Cr9Mo21Ni20 and Ni3Ti intermetallics, is less
   sensitive to the joining temperature, while the microstructure of Zone 2
   is strongly dependent on the joining temperature. The joint strength, as
   revealed, is closely related with the microstructure of Zone 2. The
   maximum joint strength obtained is 320.3 MPa. The results of thermal
   exposure show that the joint can maintain microstructural stability
   below 973 K. The microstructural evolution of joint during thermal
   exposure and its influence on mechanical performance were revealed. The

AB The present article focuses on establishing the nature of excessive
   grain growth in a new gamma-gamma ' superalloy, by investigating the
   underlying driving forces. Excessive grain growth upon annealing after
   deformation is a common phenomenon among Nickel-based superalloys. It
   shares common features with abnormal grain growth, but is fundamentally
   different, since not driven by capillarity forces. It consists in the
   selective and exaggerated growth of some grains, leading to the
   formation of heterogeneous microstructures and dramatically decreased
   mechanical properties. The present study demonstrates that the stored
   energy in the deformed matrix is the key driving force for exaggerated
   grain growth. The self-impingement of those grains is the main
   phenomenon limiting their growth, as Zener pinning by second-phase
   particles plays a minor role in the process. The absence of stored
   energy in the overgrown grains, the kinetics of their development and
   the existence of an incubation time before their appearance in the
   microstructures lead to the conclusion that excessive grain growth is a
   case of "critical" static recrystallization, involving a limited amount
   of nuclei. By evaluating the magnitude of the driving forces in presence
   before annealing, the microstructure evolutions during further annealing
   can be predicted, independently from the processing conditions. (C) 2018

AB The influence of solution heat treatment on microstructure and tensile
   property of Inconel 718 formed by high-deposition-rate laser metal

   treatment regimes were employed: 1100 degrees C x 0.5 h/WQ+720 degrees C
   x 8 h/FC to 620 degrees C x 8 h/AC (this type of samples is called
   type-S) and 1100 degrees C x 1 h/WQ+720 degrees C x 8 h/FC to 620
   degrees C x 8 h/AC (this type of samples is called type-L). The results
   showed that niobium segregation and Laves phases were eliminated both in
   type-S and type-L samples. This means that heat treatment at 1100
   degrees C for no more than 0.5 h is enough, if initial epitaxial
   columnar grains are needed and niobium segregation and Laves phases are
   tend to be removed. Twins only existed in type-L sample, which was the
   main reason why the elongation of type-L was superior to that of type-S.
   The fracture mechanism of these two samples was microvoids coalescence
   ductile rupture. The separation of the granular sub-micron particles and
   the gamma matrix was the main nucleus of the micro-voids. (C) 2017

AB The precipitation behavior of the gamma" phase and mechanical properties
   in Inconel 718 alloy during aging under an external applied stress or
   internal quench-in residual stress were studied. The results show that
   nucleation and precipitation of the gamma" phase are strongly promoted
   by external stress in the early stages of aging. The gamma" precipitates
   exhibit homogeneous nucleation and always maintain a coherent
   relationship with the matrix. Further, the competitive growth of gamma"
   particles, namely coarsening, is the dominant process in the
   intermediate and late stages of aging. Aging under external stress may
   promote the nucleation rate, and therefore produce a higher number
   density of nuclei and, consequently, smaller precipitates after aging
   for 8 h. Moreover, the strength increment is sensitive to the mean size
   of gamma" precipitates. The decrease in strength is mainly due to the
   size reduction of precipitates in samples aged under external stress for
   8 h. In the second experiment, the internal residual stress is
   distributed unevenly, resulting in inhomogeneous microstructure and
   mechanical properties in the workpiece. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All

AB As a key part of the aeroengine, the importance of seamless ring is
   self-evident. Obviously, the uniformity of thermal parameters and
   microstructure evolution of seamless ring has an extremely significant
   effect on its mechanical properties and service life. In this paper, a
   3D FEM model was developed to analyze the influence of different rolling
   passes on thermal parameters and microstructure evolution via
   ring-rolling process of GH4738 superalloy. Meanwhile, two groups of
   experiment were designed: single-pass rolling with large deformation and
   multi-pass rolling with small deformation in each pass. Through
   comprehensive analysis of the results, conclusions can be summarized as
   follows. (1) The temperature distribution is more uniform under the
   condition of multi-pass rolling with small deformation in each pass. (2)
   The effective strain distribution is more non-uniform under the
   condition of single-pass rolling with large deformation. (3) Single-pass
   rolling with large deformation leads to smaller grains, while multi-pass
   rolling with small deformation leads to more homogeneous microstructure
   and less mixed crystal phenomenon. (4) We can, through distributing the
   deformation of each rolling pass reasonably, improve the thermal
   parameters and microstructure distribution.

AB The Inconel 740 superalloy was prepared by the electron beam smelting
   (EBS) technology, the precipitation behavior and strengthening mechanism
   were studied, and the hot deformation characteristics of EBS 740
   superalloy were investigated. The results indicate that the EBS 740
   superalloy is mainly strengthened by the mechanism of weakly coupled
   dislocation shearing, and the resulting critical shear stress is
   calculated to be 234.6 MPa. The deformation parameters show a great
   influence on the flow behavior of EBS 740 superalloy. The strain rate
   sensitivity exponent increases with the increasing of deformation
   temperature, and the strain hardening exponent shows a decreasing trend
   with the increasing of strain. The activation energy of EBS 740 above
   800 A degrees C is measured to be 408.43 kJ/mol, which is higher than
   the 740H superalloy. A hyperbolic-sine-type relationship can be observed
   between the peak stress and Zener-Hollomon parameter. Nevertheless, the
   influence of deformation parameters is found to be considerably
   different at temperatures below and above 800 A degrees C. The size of
   dynamic recrystallization (DRX) grains decreases with the increasing of
   strain rate when the strain rate is lower than 1/s, and reverse law can
   be found at higher strain rate. As a result, a piecewise function is
   established between the DRX grain size and hot working parameters.

   C1023 casting was investigated by corn paring as cast superalloy and
   heat treated superalloy in the paper. Influences of strengtheners and
   carbides on the tensile behaviors of heat treated superalloy at
   different temperatures (20 degrees C, 650 degrees C, and 850 degrees C)
   were studied. Resulting data from deep corrosion suggested that growth
   mode of scripted carbide included nucleation on the vertex of blocky
   carbonitride, expansion of dendrite arm in C-rich area, and enlargement
   of dendrite cap. Decomposition of MC carbide generated numerous
   octahedral M23C6 carbide as well as nanoscale Cr-Mo-rich nuclei.
   Diffusion of Mo from gamma to precipitates such as MC, and M23C6,
   occurred during the heat treatment while irregular gamma' (4 nm-500 nm)
   transformed into cuboidal particles. At 650 degrees C, no significant
   deterioration of tensile strength was found while plastic deformation
   ability of gamma base was improved. Oxidation of grain boundaries (GBs)
   dominated the crack behavior of the superalloy at 850 degrees C.

AB Stellite 6 cobalt-based alloy powder was used to produce Co-Cr-W alloy
   using laser additive manufacturing technology, and then different heat
   treatment strategies were carried out on the deposited sample. The
   characteristics of microstructure under different heat treatment
   conditions were investigated using scanning electron microscopy with
   energy dispersive spectroscopy, transmission electron microscope, and
   x-ray diffraction. The results show that the as-deposited sample has few
   cracks or pores, and the microstructure is typical dendritic structure,
   and lamellar eutectic carbides are rich in Cr in interdendritic. The
   matrix mainly consists of gamma phases and a few epsilon phases. Some
   gamma phases transform into epsilon phases after 900 degrees C/6 h aging
   treatment and lamellar eutectic carbides transform into blocky carbides
   presenting as a network, most of the carbides are rich in Cr and a few
   are rich in W. When heat treated at 1200 degrees C/1 h followed by water
   cooling and then treated at 900 degrees C/6 h followed by furnace
   cooling, it can be found that some gamma phases transform into epsilon
   phases. The carbides transform into elliptical M23C6 carbides that are
   rich in Cr with the size of 1 to 3 mu m and a part of W-rich carbides.

   significantly influenced by oxygen/fuel ratio and other spraying
   parameters. The effect of oxygen/fuel ratio on the oxidation behavior,
   bond strength, hardness, roughness and microstructure including
   porosity, inclusion formation and unmelted particles are discussed here.
   The porosity and inclusion in C1 coating are maximal. C2 coating with
   oxygen/fuel ratio of 2 has the highest bond strength and the lowest
   unmelted particles. C3 coating with the lowest total porosity and
   inclusion has the minimal roughness and the highest oxidation resistance
   and hardness among all candidate coatings. C5 coating with oxygen/fuel
   ratio of 3 has the highest unmelted particles and roughness, and has the
   lowest inclusion. Oxygen/fuel ratio for optimal HVOF NiCoCrAlY coating
   is selected by using analytic hierarchy process (AHP-VIKOR) to achieve
   best microstructure, mechanical properties and oxidation resistance at
   1100 A degrees C. Results show that the best selection is C3 coating
   with oxygen/fuel ratio of 2.27 (820/360). This is in good concordance
   with empirical findings.

AB The integration of additive manufacturing into traditional manufacturing
   processes presents the future of engineered components with similar or
   superior performance levels to wrought or cast materials. In this work,
   the hot-deformation behavior and the microstructural changes of
   heat-treated SLM-printed IN718 specimens are investigated. Samples
   having the same shape and size were 3D-printed, homogenized (1100 A
   degrees C, 1 h, and furnace-cooled), and hot-compressed, using a
   GleebleA (R) 3800 physical simulator at 1000 and 1050 A degrees C and
   0.1 and 0.01 s(-1) strain rates. A 3D diagram showing the effect of
   temperature and strain rate on the flow stress behavior of IN718 during
   hot deformation is plotted. The dynamic recrystallization (DRX)
   mechanism was dominant in all specimens tested at 0.1 s(-1), while
   dynamic recovery (DRV) dominated in 0.01 s(-1) tests. Changing the
   strain rate from 0.01 to 0.1 s(-1) at 1000 A degrees C increased the
   peak stress from 150 to 290 MPa (93%), while with a temperature decrease
   from 1050 to 1000 A degrees C at 0.1 s(-1), the peak stress increased by
   45%. Thus, the mechanical behavior was found to be more dependent on the
   strain rate than on the temperature. The DRX structure showed new grains
   developing at the boundaries of the original grains, whereas with the
   DRV structure, new grains grew within the original grains. A
   phenomenological model based on the Zener-Hollomon parameter was
   proposed in order to predict the size of recrystallized grains during
   hot deformation of the SLM-printed IN718 superalloy. The thermal
   softening due to recrystallization was compensated by precipitation
   hardening, as was revealed by phase analysis.

   and a decrease in the strain rate. The characteristic of dynamic
   recrystallization is revealed by the flow curves. The variation rule of
   the flow stress can be well described by the hyperbolic sine type

   proceeded to depict static recrystallization, grain growth and
   precipitation phenomena. The mechanical properties evolution and the
   fracture surface analysis showed the occurrence of softening phenomenon
   in the temperature range of 900-950 A degrees C as a result of either
   partial or full recrystallization. At 1050 A degrees C, precipitation of
   Nb-rich phase caused an increase in ultimate shear strength of the
   alloy. Additionally, shear punch fracture surfaces of the samples
   annealed at 900-1000 A degrees C represented dimple mode, with grain
   boundary decohesion being seen to occur at higher temperatures.

AB The sensitivity to hydrogen embrittlement (HE) has been studied in
   respect of precipitation size distributions in two nickel-based
   superalloys: Alloy 718 (UNS N07718) and Alloy 945X (UNS N09946).
   Quantitative microstructure analysis was carried out by the combination
   of scanning and transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive
   x-ray spectroscopy (EDS). While Alloy 718 is mainly strengthened by
   gamma aEuro(3), and therefore readily forms intergranular delta phase,
   Alloy 945X has been designed to avoid delta formation by reducing Nb
   levels providing high strength through a combination of gamma' and gamma
   aEuro(3). Slow strain rate tensile tests were carried out for different
   microstructural conditions in air and after cathodic hydrogen (H)
   charging. HE sensitivity was determined based on loss of elongation due
   to the H uptake in comparison to elongation to failure in air. Results
   showed that both alloys exhibited an elevated sensitivity to HE.
   Fracture surfaces of the H precharged material showed quasi-cleavage and
   transgranular cracks in the H-affected region, while ductile failure was
   observed toward the center of the sample. The crack origins observed on
   the H precharged samples exhibited quasi-cleavage with slip traces at
   high magnification. The sensitivity is slightly reduced for Alloy 718,
   by coarsening gamma aEuro(3) and reducing the overall strength of the
   alloy. However, on further coarsening of gamma aEuro(3), which promotes
   continuous decoration of grain boundaries with delta phase, the
   embrittlement index rose again indicating a change of hydrogen
   embrittlement mechanism from hydrogen-enhanced local plasticity (HELP)
   to hydrogen-enhanced decohesion embrittlement (HEDE). In contrast, Alloy
   945X displayed a strong correlation between strength, based on
   precipitation size and embrittlement index, due to the absence of any
   significant formation of delta phase for the investigated
   microstructures. For the given test parameters, Alloy 945X did not
   display any reduced sensitivity to HE compared with Alloy 718 when
   considering high-strength conditions despite the absence of
   intergranular delta phase.

   in lamellar form were more likely to liquate during repair-welding. The
   melting of borides and intermetallic compounds in 1180 degrees C/4 h
   treated samples confirmed the poor weldability of the Mar-M004
   superalloy due to enhanced liquation cracking. In addition to boride
   formation, fractographs of liquation cracks revealed strong segregation
   of B element in carbides and intermetallics, which might further lower
   the solidus temperature of the repair weld.

AB Materials used as reinforcement for conductors in high-field magnets
   require both a high capacity for load bearing and a high resistance to
   deformation under stress; that is, a high value for tensile strength and
   a high modulus of elasticity. In addition, compatibility between the
   magnet conductor and any proposed reinforcement materials has to be
   carefully evaluated in terms of their capability for thermal expansion,
   stability at high temperature, resistance to oxidation, and crack
   propagation. We investigated a number of (nickel based and nickel-cobalt
   based) superalloys designed for high-temperature applications. These
   superalloys have higher Young's modulus than the stainless steels that
   are currently used as reinforcement materials for high-field magnets.
   Our test materials were subjected to thermo-mechanical processing that
   strengthens the alloys by forming very fine particles within them. Our
   initial work focused on changes that occured in the alloy during
   deformation at either cryogenic or room temperature. Because we observed
   distinct interfaces between the particles and the matrix, we decided
   that these materials could be described as precipitate-strengthened
   alloys. Both the strengthening component area and the matrix had more
   resistance to plastic deformation at cryogenic temperatures, than at
   room temperatures. In some cases, we further enhanced the strength of
   the alloy by doping them with other elements. In all the cases, these
   alloys permitted more efficient performance of conductors by shareing
   more of the load than would be possible with stainless steel
   reinforcement materials. This paper outlines the properties of these new
   alloys and establishes their compatibility with certain conductors
   commonly used for high-field magnets.

   Their bulk microstructures were studied in as-cast condition and in two

   aging were characterized. The cobalt enrichment succeeded in avoiding
   chromium carbides formation and in stabilizing the TaC carbides at high

   not perfect, it was much better than the one of the chromium carbides,
   but can be improved by the total removal of nickel. Unfortunately, at
   the same time, the oxidation behavior, initially good, shows increased
   rate of the oxides formation. The room temperature hardness was also

AB The effect of the substrate temperature in the deposition process of the
   NiCrAI coating was evaluated on the steel substrate using cathodic arc
   deposition. The deposition process was conducted at temperatures of
   250-700 degrees C. The coating microstructure properties were studied by
   scanning electron microscope and the coating phases were characterized
   by X-ray diffraction analysis for the deposited samples at different
   temperatures. By increasing the substrate temperature from 250 degrees C
   to 700 degrees C, the coating porosity was reduced from 4.4% to 0.6%.
   The phase studies showed that the sample deposited at the temperature of
   250 degrees C contained the alpha-Cr phase and the preferred texture in
   this phase belonged to the (200) plane. By increasing the substrate
   temperature, the Cr atoms were dissolved in the gamma-Ni phase and the
   alpha-Cr phase was not formed in the coating. Comparing the intensity of
   peaks in the X-ray diffraction analysis for the deposited samples at
   different temperatures showed that by increasing the substrate
   temperature, the crystallization degree of the coating was increased.

AB Up to date, IN713C Nickel-based superalloy has been continued to be the
   best alloy candidate for turbocharger wheel applications due to its
   adequate fatigue property and resistance to degradation under harsh
   operating environments. Throughout this study, three different batches
   of as-cast IN713C nickel based superalloys with different
   microstructures including columnar, equiaxed and transition
   microstructures were investigated. Strain control Low Cycle fatigue
   (LCF) tests were conducted for the three different microstructures,
   achieving fatigue life between 100 and runout at 100,000 cycles,
   depending on the testing parameters. The fracture mechanics and failure
   mechanism were correlated to the alloys microstructure, texture and
   chemical composition under various LCF conditions using optical
   microscopy, SEM, EDX and EBSD. In the current study an exact correlation
   between alloys microstructure/microtexture and LCF endurance is
   established. The results showed that equiaxed microstructure has a
   superior fatigue life than the transition microstructure by 10% and
   columnar microstructure by > 200% at a given temperature and strain
   rate. This large discrepancy was mainly due to the grain size
   differences between the studied microstructures. Here, it was evidenced
   that the grain size controls the dendrites length. It is also
   demonstrated that all microstructures exhibited a longer fatigue life at
   room temperature than at 650 degrees C, doubling or tripling the fatigue
   life of the tested IN713C. Furthermore, the high presence of
   precipitates between dendritic arms in all three microstructures was
   found to have great influence on crack propagation path. It was apparent
   that segregated carbides in between dendritic arms caused secondary
   crack initiation and crack path undulations during the LCF tests.

AB A critical evaluation of recrystallization vs. strain induced boundary
   migration (SIBM) as the mechanism responsible behind the grain boundary
   engineering (GBE) in alloy 617 is made. Towards this hot deformation
   processing (in the temperature range of 1173-1473 K and strain rates of
   0.001-10 s(-1)) as well as GBE-type iterative processing is performed on
   solution-annealed specimen. GBE-quantifying parameters such as Sigma
   3(n) fraction, triple junction distribution, twin-related grain size
   ratio, twin-related domain (TRD) parameters and fractal dimension have
   been utilized to quantify the extent of GBE in the processed
   microstructures. Occurrence of dynamic recrystallization (DRX) during
   hot deformation processing does not induce notable multiple twinning
   leading to a microstructure analogous to that of solution-annealed
   condition even after complete DRX. Following GBE-type iterative
   processing, GBE microstructure has only been achieved when prolific
   multiple twinning occurred due to activation of SIBM leading to a high
   fraction of Sigma 3(n) boundaries (similar to 79%) with most of the
   twins being part of the grain boundary network. Consequently, an
   increasing proportion of J2 and J3 triple junctions with a concomitant
   increase in both the average number of grains per TRD and twin-related
   grain size ratio are achieved. However, occurrence of static
   recrystallization during GBE-type processing has led to smaller TRD size
   and copious random boundaries connectivity as confirmed by fractal
   analysis thus clearly suggesting that SIBM, not recrystallization
   catalyzes the profusion of Sigma 3(n) boundaries. As GBE relies on the
   multiple twinning mechanisms promoted via SIBM, recrystallization needs
   to be circumvented for successful attainment of GBE microstructure. (C)

   strongly related to the SO2 levels and was significantly affected by
   NaCl additions. In presence of the atmospheres with 0.1% SO2, the alloy
   exhibited the highest corrosion resistance due to formation of a stable
   and dense Cr2O3 film. In presence of the atmosphere with 1.5% SO2,
   however, a non-coherent and porous Cr2O3 film was formed. The thickness
   of film and internal sulfides were substantially increased. The NaCl
   additions significantly accelerated the corrosion process. A
   non-protective outer oxide film was formed, composed by multiple layers
   with serious inner sulfide and spallation. The depths of internal

   cutting force, the axial surface roughness, and the surface
   microhardness are reduced dramatically. In addition, the quality of

   facilitated significantly under the effects of electropulsing. For
   GH4169 superalloy, the enhanced ability of the plastic deformation and
   the promoted mobility of dislocations in the cutting layer under the

   LCF experiments were conducted with the specimens subjected to different

   Simulations based on finite element method (FEM) were implemented with
   the 3D digital model obtained from synchrotron radiation X-ray
   computerized tomography (CT) to investigate the effect of microporosity.
   Results indicated that microporosity was a dominant factor of fatigue
   crack and the parameters of microporosity including of porosity,
   effective diameter, and distribution co-contributed to affect fatigue
   life. The delta stack and carbide were observed to be fatigue crack
   sites. The HIP specimen had long fatigue cycle life since casting pore
   and acicular delta were eliminated, while further SHT can reintroduce
   delta into matrix resulting in high strength and low fatigue life. LCF
   crack behaviors in HIP + SHT superalloy depended on surface quality,
   stress concentration, and the quantity of carbide.

   behavior of gamma' precipitates in Ni-Co base superalloy TMW-4M3 ("TMW"
   is a trademark of National Institute for Materials Science registered in

   strengthened by gamma', and thus the control of size and distribution of
   gamma' precipitates is very important for practical applications.
   Precipitation behavior of gamma' in TMW-4M3 is strongly influenced by
   heat treatment conditions. Therefore, numerical simulation is useful for
   finding the most appropriate manufacturing condition prior to
   experimental trial and error approach. Firstly, we investigated the
   gamma' solvus temperature and improved several thermodynamic parameters
   of the conventional database to obtain reasonable phase boundaries
   between gamma/eta (Ni3Ti) and gamma/gamma'. Based on the new
   thermodynamic description, the nucleation rates related to temperature
   histories were calculated by using the CNT with composition balance
   equation under subsolvus solution treatment. Finally, the
   multi-phase-field method coupled with the CALPHAD approach and CNT model
   was applied to the microstructure evolution of intragranular secondary
   gamma' particles. The experimental and simulated microstructures show
   good agreement with each other. This method might be useful for

   superalloy designed for application of 700 degrees C advanced
   ultra-supercritical units component. The results show that boron in the
   content range of 25-75 ppm has no obvious influence on as-cast and
   heat-treated microstructure characteristics compared with that of the
   alloy without boron. During long-term thermal exposure, the variation of
   B content has no obvious effect on gamma" coarsening, delta phase
   precipitation and MC carbide degeneration, but inhibits the
   agglomeration of M23C6 carbide along grain boundary. According to the
   mechanical property analysis, the boron additions contribute to mainly
   tensile ductility especially the elongation of whether the heat treated
   alloy or the long-term thermal exposed alloy. The strength especially
   yield strength of the B doped alloy almost keeps the same level as that
   of the B-free alloy. Furthermore, the SEM fractography shows a change
   from intergranular fracture to a mixed fracture and the dimples on
   fracture surface obviously increase with the addition of boron. The
   mechanism discussion reveals that the segregation of boron at grain
   boundary resulted in the improvement of grain boundary cohesion and the
   optimization of carbides distribution at grain boundary. The
   strengthening mechanism of delta phase is confirmed as its obstacle
   effect to dislocation movement.

   during hot forging was studied in order to explore the suitability of

   press, considering aspects such as deformation inhomogeneity, flow
   localization and shear bands formation. Hot forging trials in screw
   press with double truncated cones were carried out at three different
   temperatures, 950, 1050 & 1150 degrees C. The microstructure in the
   as-preheated condition was analysed in order to understand the impact of
   soaking temperature on the evolution of both grain size and
   precipitates/carbides prior to hot forging operations. In the as-forged
   condition, the impact of forging temperature, strain, strain rate and
   chilling effect of the dies on the microstructural evolution of Nimonic
   80a was studied. No evidences of shear bands or flow localisation
   associated to adiabatic heating were found in the hot forged double
   truncated cones, indicating the suitability of Nimonic 80a to be
   processed in screw press. However, the non-isothermal conditions of
   screw press resulted into the development of heterogeneous structures
   across the thickness. Highly or fully unrecrystallized structures were
   observed in those areas in contact with bottom die, in contrast with top
   positions, where highly recrystallized structures were found. Soaking
   treatments play a very important role on microstructural evolution
   during hot forging for Nimonic 80a due to its strong impact on both
   grain growth and dissolution/precipitation of precipitates/carbides. For
   the present work, discontinuous dynamic recrystallization (DDRX) was
   found to be the main recrystallization mechanism for Nimonic 80a. Clear
   evidences of nucleation of new DRX grains by the formation of bulges in
   serrated grain boundaries with the subsequent growth by twinning were
   observed at the three forging temperatures. Particle-stimulated
   nucleation mechanism (PSN) is also operating in Nimonic 80a enhancing
   the heterogeneous nucleation of new grains in the interior of deformed
   grains.

   constitutional supercooling decreases correspondingly. Comparing the
   microstructures of samples formed under different process parameters,
   the size and amount of the gamma+Laves eutectic phases formed in
   interdendritic area decrease along with the increasing magnetic field
   intensity, resulting in more uniformly distributed alloying elements.
   The residual stress distribution is proved to be more uniform, which is
   beneficial to the grain refinement after recrystallilzaiton. Mechanical
   properties testing results show an improvement of 100 MPa in tensile
   strength and 22% in elongation was obtained after EMS was used. The high
   cycle fatigue properties at room temperature was also improved from 4.09
   x 10(4) cycles to 8.21 x 10(4) cycles for the as-deposited samples, and
   from 5.45 x 10(4) cycles to 12.73 x 10(4) cycles for the heat treated
   samples respectively. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   high-temperature exposition (25, 50, 75, 100 and 150 h) in air
   environment at 800 A degrees C. Detailed analysis of oxidized surfaces
   by scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive spectroscopy and

AB High-temperature tensile deformation behavior of directionally
   solidified nickel base superalloy CM 247 DS is studied by conducting
   tensile tests in temperature range RT-955 A degrees C employing a
   constant strain rate of 10(-3) s(-1) and carrying out extensive electron
   microscopic examinations to understand the concomitant substructural
   evolution. The alloy exhibits yield strength anomaly (YSA) behavior like
   many other superalloys, and the yield strength maxima occur at 750 A
   degrees C. However, unlike in most of the superalloys, ductility
   continuously increases with temperature. The deformation behavior of the
   alloy changes significantly with temperature. Transmission electron
   microscopic examination confirmed that at lower temperature
   (ae<currency>A 750 A degrees C), gamma' shearing is the dominant
   deformation mechanism; whereas at temperatures above 750 A degrees C,
   thermally activated dislocation looping around gamma' precipitate is
   dominant. Substructures evolved during deformation at 750 A degrees C
   consists mainly of superlattice stacking faults (SSFs) inside gamma'
   precipitates, whereas at 850 A degrees C uniform dislocation tangles are
   observed in gamma matrix. Superlattice stacking faults result from
   shearing of gamma' precipitate by a/3aOE (c) 112 > dislocations, which
   arise from the decomposition of a/2aOE (c) 110 > matrix dislocations.
   YSA in this alloy is attributed to dislocation interactions inside
   gamma'; however, the enhanced ductility even at 750 A degrees C is due
   to formation of SSFs.

AB In this investigation, Inconel 600 alloy was thermomechanically
   processed to different strains via hot rolling followed by a short-time
   annealing treatment to determine an appropriate thermomechanical process
   to achieve a high fraction of low-I  pound CSL boundaries. Experimental
   results demonstrate that a certain level of deformation is necessary to
   obtain effective "grain boundary engineering"; i.e., the deformation
   must be sufficiently high to provide the required driving force for
   postdeformation static recrystallization, yet it should be low enough to
   retain a large fraction of original twin boundaries. Samples processed
   in such a fashion exhibited 77 pct length fraction of low-I  pound CSL
   boundaries, a dominant fraction of which was from I 3 pound (similar to
   64 pct), the latter with very low deviation from its theoretical
   misorientation. The application of hot rolling also resulted in a very
   low fraction of I 1 pound (similar to 1 pct) boundaries, as desired. The
   process also leads to so-called "triple junction engineering" with the
   generation of special triple junctions, which are very effective in
   disrupting the connectivity of the random grain boundary network.

AB The complex thermal histories in additive manufacturing (AM) of metals
   result in the presence of residual stresses in the fabricated
   components. The amount of residual stress accumulated during AM depends
   on the high temperature constitutive behavior of the material. The rapid
   solidification and repeated thermal cycles with each laser pass result
   in material contraction, and subject the surrounding, constrained
   material to both elevated temperatures and internal stresses, providing
   driving forces for stress relaxation. In this study, the stress
   relaxation behavior and mechanisms of conventionally processed and
   additively manufactured Inconel 625 (CP-IN625 and AM-IN625) at 600
   degrees C and 700 degrees C were investigated via compression tests up
   to an engineering strain of 9% with in situ neutron diffraction
   characterization. The stress decayed to a plateau stress equivalent to
   18% of the peak stress in CP-IN625 and 16% in AM-IN625 at 600 degrees C,
   and 39% in CP-IN625 and 44% in AM-IN625 at 700 degrees C. At the same
   temperature, the stress relaxation rate in AM-IN625 was twice as high as
   that in CP-IN625, and the magnitude of the plateau stress in AM-IN625
   was slightly lower than that in CP-IN625, as the textured AM-IN625 had
   much larger grains than the texture-free CP-IN625. The stress relaxation
   in CP- and AM-IN625 was deduced to be controlled by dislocation glide
   and climb, where dislocations interact with grain boundaries, solute
   atoms, and secondary phases. The stress relaxation constitutive behavior
   reported here is a necessary input for the development of accurate
   thermomechanical models used to predict and minimize residual stresses
   and distortion in AM, as well as to predict the stress relaxation
   behavior of Inconel 625 in high temperature structural applications.

AB Inconel 718 produced by selective laser melting (SLM) has been
   characterized with focus on the microstructure, the dependence of sample
   orientation on the mechanical properties and the effects of post heat
   treatments. The as-manufactured IN718 has a very fine cellular-dendritic
   structure with fine Laves phases precipitating in the interdendritic
   region, and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) analysis shows that
   both the vertically and horizontally built samples have relatively weak
   texture. The vertically built samples show lower tensile strength but
   higher ductility than the horizontally built samples, and the mechanism
   is shown to be partly due to the crystallographic feature but more
   importantly due to the different amount of residual stress and
   dislocations accumulated in these two kinds of samples. Applying heat
   treatments can significantly increase the strength while decrease the
   ductility correspondingly, and difference in yield strength between the
   vertically and horizontally built samples decreases with increasing the
   heat treatment temperatures, mainly due to the removal of residual
   stress and dislocations.

   quasi-static to quasi-dynamic regions (0.001 s(-1)-10 s(-1)) to a final
   true strain 0.69 (50% Engineering strain). The flow curves at all strain
   rates and high temperatures (1100 degrees C, 1200 degrees C) exhibit a
   peak stress, confirming the dynamic recrystallization (DRX) phenomena.
   To predict and establish the safe hot workability window, processing
   maps were evaluated based on the dynamic material model and plotted for
   strain of 0.65. Based on the detailed microstructure analysis and the
   identification of the active softening mechanisms, the optimal hot
   workability window was found to be 1200 degrees C and 0.001 s(-1). Bulk
   texture analysis revealed presence of fiber textures <011> and <001>
   parallel to deformation axis (ND), which were prevalent at high
   temperature and low strain rate conditions. Using Arrhenius model, the
   apparent hot working activation energy (Q(Hw)) was determined as 474
   kJ/mol. Zener-Holloman parameter was calculated to gauge the deformation
   resistance and found to have a linear relationship with peak flow stress
   at given deformation conditions.

   compared to other AM techniques and conventional methods of producing

   HT + Shot Peening (SP), and 4) HIP + FIT + SP. The original anisotropic
   properties arising from the building process are reduced by the thermal
   treatments. The HT process produced the highest hardness and mechanical
   properties while the HIP + HT condition produced similar tensile and

   regard, five alloys with different amounts of boron 0.00-0.016 wt%) and

   then purified via the vacuum arc remelting. Microstructural observations
   were carried out through optical and scanning electron microscopes and
   phase analysis was performed by x-ray diffraction analysis. The tensile
   test was carried out at room temperature and 704 degrees C on the
   alloys. The results showed a slight effect of boron and zirconium on
   grain size while they had significant effect on the amount and the
   stability of the delta phase. These elements increase the lattice
   mismatch and the elastic strain between the gamma and gamma' phases.
   Boron and zirconium increased the ductility at room temperature by 10%
   and 12% and at the 704 degrees C by 8% and 5%, respectively. The effect
   of these elements on the strength at room temperature was negligible,
   while at 704 degrees C, boron and zirconium increased the yield strength
   by 17% and 16% and the ultimate strength by 8% and 7%, respectively. The
   improved cohesion and strength of the grain boundaries and an increase
   in delta phase and the elastic strain between gamma and gamma' phases
   are the most important causes for improving the ductility and strength
   of the alloy 718Plus in the presence of boron and zirconium.

   consisting of gamma' sub-solvus solution treatments followed by aging,
   was conducted on the linear friction welded samples. High temperature
   creep tests were performed on the as-welded and PWHTed joints at two
   different temperatures: 700 degrees C under 600 and 750 MPa stress
   levels, and 850 degrees C under 100 and 200 MPa stresses. The creep
   resistance of the PWHTed joints was higher than that of the as-welded
   samples. The PWHTed, joints exhibited better ductility than that of the
   base material at 850 degrees C, while they showed slightly lower creep
   life at 700 degrees C in comparison to the base metal. Microstructure
   examination showed that cracks initiated at the interface of oxidized
   particles at 700 C. The decrease in creep resistance of the AD730 (TM)
   Ni-based superalloy at 850 degrees C was related to a combination of the
   formation of precipitate-free zones (PFZ) in the vicinity of the grain
   boundaries (GBs) and microcracking assisted by oxidation. The
   Larson-Miller Parameter (LMP) was used to correlate the creep strength,
   temperature and time to failure for the as-welded and PWHTed samples.
   LMP values varied between 21.5 x 10(3) and 24.5 x 10(3). It was found
   that in the investigated temperature range, the PWHTed AD730 (TM) has
   similar creep characteristics as Udimet (TM) 720 Li and Inconel 738LC at
   low values of LMP and better creep properties than those of the Inconel

   The distribution of grain size, low-angle grain boundaries (LAGBs), and
   twin boundaries throughout the joints were quantitatively analyzed. The
   weld power, axial load, and weld temperature were monitored. The grain
   structure evolution during friction welding was clarified. The grain
   structure in the recrystallization zone (RXZ) of the weld was a result
   of competition between dynamic recrystallization and grain boundary
   sliding (GBS), which is controlled by the local deformation condition.
   The axial force during welding decreased with reducing the rotation rate
   from 1000 rpm to 500 rpm. This anomalistic phenomenon can be ascribed
   that a decrease in rotation rate resulted in finer grain size in the RXZ
   of the weld, which required lower applied force to enable GBS.

   precipitation process observed after two different heat treatment
   conditions applied experimentally and numerically to regenerate the
   original microstructure of the IN-792 superalloy The experimental
   results were consistent with the calculated isoplethic and TTP diagrams.
   In terms of accuracy, the further development of the, ermo-Calc

AB A non weldable nickel-based superalloy was fabricated by powder
   bed-based selective electron beam melting (S-EBM). The as-built samples
   exhibit a heterogeneous microstructure along the build direction. A
   gradient of columnar grain size as well as a significant gradient in the
   y' precipitate size were found along the build direction.
   Microstructural defects such as gas porosity inherited from the powders,
   shrinkage pores and cracks inherited from the S-EBM process were
   identified. The origins of those defects are discussed with a particular
   emphasis on crack formation. Cracks were consistently found to propagate
   intergranular and the effect of crystallographic misorientation on the
   cracking behavior was investigated. A clear correlation was identified
   between cracks and high angle grain boundaries (HAUB). The cracks were
   classified as hot cracks based on the observation of the fracture
   surface of micro-tensile specimens machined from as-built S-EBM samples.
   The conditions required to trigger hot cracking, namely, presence of a
   liquid film during the last stage of solidification and thermal stresses
   are discussed within the framework of additive manufacturing.
   Understanding the cracking mechanism enables to provide guidelines to
   obtain crack-free specimens of non-weldable Ni-based superalloys
   produced by S-EBM. (C) 2017 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier

AB The formation of serrated grain boundaries and its mechanism correlated
   with straining exerted on grain boundaries were investigated in a
   Ni-20Cr binary model alloy. This model alloy is a full solid-solution
   which is deliberately free of carbon and aluminum to exclude
   precipitation of second phase. A special heat treatment involving slow
   cooling was used to promote grain boundary serration, which is known to
   enhance creep properties by decreasing interfacial free energy. No sign
   of serration could be observed for the Ni-20Cr model alloy, as expected.
   However, we found that a compressive 5% strain hold applied during slow
   cooling successfully induced grain boundary serration. The compressive
   5% strain hold generated dislocations near the grain boundary, which
   promoted Cr enrichment near and at the grain boundary. To dismiss the
   effect of dislocations, straining was removed and the solutionizing
   temperature was increased in order to promote Cr enrichment near and at
   grain boundaries by means of vacancy-assisted diffusion of Cr atoms from
   the bulk to grain boundaries during slow cooling. Significant grain
   boundary serration was again observed. Atom probe tomography analyses
   showed that the serrated grain boundary with a wide width of 10 run was
   enriched with Cr atoms, as much as 87 at.%, while the gamma matrix only
   contained 34 at.%. First-principles calculations showed that the strain
   energy necessary for the onset of grain boundary serration is lower than
   0.97 kJ/mol.

AB Fatigue fracture is one of the major degradation mechanisms in the
   low-alloy 4330 carbon steel pumps that are utilized in the hydraulic
   fracturing process operating under cyclic loading conditions. A weld
   cladding technology has been developed to improve the ability of these
   components to resist fatigue crack initiation by cladding them with a
   secondary material. This process introduces a residual stress profile
   into the component that can be potentially detrimental for fatigue
   performance. The cladding technology under examination is a low-alloy
   4330 carbon steel substrate weld that is clad with the
   nickel-chromium-based superalloy IN625 and is investigated herein using
   several experimental residual stress measurement techniques.
   Understanding the magnitude and distribution of residual stress in weld
   clad components is of the utmost importance to accurately assess the
   performance of the component in service. This study summarizes the
   results of residual stress measurements that were determined using X-ray
   diffraction, i.e., hole drilling based on electronic speckle pattern
   interferometry, deep-hole drilling, and the contour method, to obtain
   the residual stress distributions from the surface of the weld clad,
   through the clad layer, and into the substrate material. The results of
   deep-hole drilling and the contour method show large-scale tensile
   residual stress in the clad layer and compressive residual stress in the
   majority of the substrate. However, the X-ray diffraction and hole
   drilling methods indicate the presence of short-scale compressive
   residual stress on the surface and near the surface of the clad layer.
   It was shown that these measurement techniques are complementary in
   assessing the residual stress profile throughout the entire component.

AB Rejuvenation heat treatment is an important technology to restore

   is conducted to figure out the effect of rejuvenation heat treatment on
   the superalloys. The microstructure and micro-hardness of K002 and DZ125
   superalloys after different heat treatment procedures were evaluated.
   The results show that the heating temperature mainly affects the
   solubility of the carbides and gamma' phases, while the cooling rate has
   an effect on the morphology of secondary gamma' phase. Owing to the
   transition of carbides during the work process, rejuvenation heat
   treatment temperature has little effect on the amount of carbides in

   rates were applied to generate different distributions of gamma'

   manufactured by hot extrusion, and the master alloy had the composition
   of an FGH4096 power metallurgy superalloy. SEM and SESD were used to
   observe the microstructure's evolution. The experimental results show
   that the fastest cooling rate corresponds to the highest creep life as
   well as the smallest rupture strain, and vice versa. The microscopic
   observations disclose that with an increasing cooling rate, the size and
   area fraction of gamma' precipitates decrease, and the rupture mechanism
   changes from transgranular to intergranular. Moreover, some gamma'
   precipitates changed to cuboid after the creep test. The results will

AB Hastelloy X (HX) is a Ni-based superalloy which suffers from high crack
   susceptibility during the laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) process. In
   this work, the microstructure of as-built HX samples was rigorously
   investigated to understand the main mechanisms leading to crack
   formation. The microstructural features of as-built HX samples consisted
   of very fine dendrite architectures with dimensions typically less than
   1 mu m, coupled with the formation of sub-micrometric carbides, the
   largest ones were mainly distributed along the interdendritic regions
   and grain boundaries. From the microstructural analyses, it appeared
   that the formation of intergranular carbides provided weaker zones,
   which combined with high thermal residual stresses resulted in hot
   cracks formation along the grain boundaries. The carbides were extracted
   from the austenitic matrix and characterized by combining different
   techniques, showing the formation of various types of Mo-rich carbides,
   classified as M6C, M12C and MnCm type. The first two types of carbides
   are typically found in HX alloy, whereas the last one is a metastable
   carbide probably generated by the very high cooling rates of the

AB The relationships between the type and morphology of carbides and
   stress-rupture property have been studied in a cast cobalt-base
   superalloy. Different types and morphologies of carbides are achieved by
   varying the heat treatment conditions. After heat treatment at 1240
   degrees C/4 h, the primary M7C3 decomposes into M23C6, and the formed
   M23C6 and primary MC partially dissolve into the matrix. After heat
   treatment at 1280 degrees C/4 h, the primary M7C3 melts, resulting in
   the formation of a highly developed lamellar structure of M23C6, and the
   primary MC mostly dissolves into the matrix. The heat treatment at 1100
   degrees C/300 h gives rise to the carbide transformation of M7C3 ->
   M23C6 and a profusion of secondary M23C6 carbide around M23C6 and MC.
   The samples in stress-rupture test at 980 degrees C for 83 MPa manifest
   the following rupture life: 1280 degrees C sample > 1240 degrees C
   sample > as-cast sample > 1100 degrees C sample. The longer rupture life
   of the samples of 1240 degrees C and 1280 degrees C is derived from the
   stable microstructure, dispersed MC carbide morphology and the
   supersaturated matrix. The shortest rupture life of the 1100 degrees C
   sample is mainly attributed to the overaging. Additionally, the carbide
   transformations of M7C3 -> M23C6, MC -> M23C6, M23C6 -> M6C take place
   in the as-cast sample during creep exposure. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All

   epitaxial growth of the grains near the fusion line was observed,
   whereas the partition coefficients and solidification temperature range
   during the thermodynamic state of equilibrium were calculated in the
   weld metal zone. The welding heat affected zone of the as-welded welding
   joint was the weakest zone. In contrast, following the post-welding heat
   treatment, the segregation was significantly eliminated in the weld
   metal zone. Also, the mechanical properties of the welding heat affected
   zone were restored to the property levels of the base metal, with the
   weld strength reduction factor of 4%. Therefore, the effects of
   post-welding heat treatment on the microstructure and properties of
   welding joint were also investigated. Following 3000 h thermal exposure
   at 750 degrees C, the coarsening rates of the spherical gamma'
   precipitates of both the as-welded and post-welding heat treatment
   samples were consistent with the Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner (LSW) model. In
   addition, the microstructure stability of the welding joint was
   excellent, without any topologically closed packed phase precipitation.
   The Haynes 282 filler metal could be a potential candidate material for

   processing. This often includes straining and annealing at solution
   annealing temperature (Le. approximate to 980 degrees C) followed by
   water quenching and subsequent aging heat treatments at lower
   temperatures. In addition to the microstructure development (i.e.
   precipitation) the aging heat treatment partially relieve the residual
   stresses generated at previous stages of forging and water quenching,
   however the stress field will not be completely relaxed. In this study,
   a series of experiments were conducted on round tensile specimens made
   from IN718 bar to investigate tensile stress relaxation behaviours at
   elevated temperatures used for aging heat treatments. The stress
   relaxation curves obtained can be described by a hyperbolic function
   with a non-zero asymptotic stress (sigma(infinity).), which seems to be
   proportional to the initially applied stress (sigma(0)) for a fixed
   temperature. This behaviour is investigated at temperatures between 620
   degrees C and 770 degrees C that is a temperature range used in industry
   to perform the aging heat treatments to obtain microstructures with
   tailored mechanical properties. It has been shown that the
   sigma(infinity)/sigma(0) ratio has decreased rapidly with increasing
   temperature at this range. The relaxation behaviour has been assessed
   numerically and an empirical relationship has been defined for each

AB The effect of grain boundary engineering (GBE) on the Te diffusion along
   the surface grain boundaries was investigated in GH3535 alloy. It can be
   found that GBE treatment increases obviously the fraction of low-Sigma
   coincidence site lattice (CSL) boundaries, especially the Sigma 3 ones,
   and introduces the large-size grain clusters. When the as-received (AR)
   and GBE-treated (GBET) specimens were exposed to Te vapor, only Sigma 3
   boundaries were found to be resistant to Te diffusion. From the cross
   section and the surface, the fewer Te-attacked grain boundaries and the
   thinner corrosion layer can be observed in the GBET sample. The
   improvement of resistance to Te diffusion in the GBET sample can be
   attributed to the large size grain-clusters associated with high
   proportion of the Sigma 3(n) boundaries. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All

AB A new Ni-based superalloy with high-Cr content was designed for
   industrial gas turbines application. The microstructural homogenization
   and high-temperature cyclic oxidation behavior was investigated
   systematically. The results showed that the optimum heat treatment
   condition was 1563 K (1290 degrees C)/4 h + 1573 K (1300 degrees C)/6 h,
   A. C. (air cooling) + 1393 K (1120 degrees C)/2 h, A. C. + 1143 K (870
   degrees C)/24 h, A. C., which can completely dissolve the gamma/gamma'
   eutectic and the Ni-3(TiTa) phase in the interdendritic region. The
   cyclic oxidation results showed that a multilayer of continuous and
   dense oxide-rich regions formed and the kinetic curves followed a
   parabolic law. The mass gain at 1323 K (1050 degrees C) and 1343 K (1070
   degrees C) was 4.02 mg/cm(2) and 4.23 mg/cm(2), respectively. No severe
   spallation of the oxide-rich region was observed. The outer layer of the
   oxide-rich region mainly consisted of Cr2O3, TiO2, and (Ni, Co) Cr2O4
   spinels, while the layer at the substrate-oxide interface was found to
   be Al2O3. The results show that this new superalloy has a better cyclic
   oxidation resistance at 1343 K (1070 degrees C) than the commonly used

AB Spray forming (SF) is a near net shape manufacturing process in a wide

   observations reveal that equiaxed grains formed in the ingots whether
   after aging process or not. The size and the volume fraction of gamma'
   precipitates increase with the ongoing of aging process, which could
   result in the change of the lattice misfit of gamma'/gamma and the
   precipitation of new sigma, eta phases. Intergranular fracture and
   transgranular fracture are main fracture mechanisms in aged state. Its

   mild steel (MS). The microstructure of the deposited clads reveals
   perfect metallurgical bonding with the substrate. The deposits are dense
   with almost negligible porosity. To enhance the mechanical properties,
   Inconel-625 clads are subjected to three different post heat treatments
   for 4 h. Compared to the as-deposited clad, the microstructure at 650
   degrees C heat treated specimens reveals no dissolution of the Laves
   phase. However, the 850 degrees C and 950 degrees C heat treated samples
   exhibit partial dissolution and complete dissolution of the Laves phase
   in the fusion zone, respectively. The 850 degrees C heat treated clads
   exhibit higher microhardness compared to the other dads (as-deposited,
   650 degrees C and 950 degrees C heat treated clads). This is attributed
   to the precipitation of gamma '' strengthening phases due to
   availability of more Nb in the fusion zone microstructure.

AB Selective laser melting (SLM) is a powder-bed fusion additive
   manufacturing process that fabricates metallic parts in a layer-by-layer
   manner. IN718 is a nickel-based austenitic (γ) superalloy with broad
   applications in aerospace, chemical, and nuclear industries. In this
   study, fully-dense IN718-matrix composite reinforced by TiC
   nanoparticles were fabricated in-situ by SLM. As-built and heattreated
   IN718/TiC nanocomposite was compared against pure IN718 in terms of
   microstructures and tensile properties. Columnar and cellular
   microstructure morphologies in as-built pure IN718 and IN718/TiC
   nanocomposite were demolished by heat treatment.Microstructure refining
   and grain boundary dislocation pinning effect of TiC nanoparticles
   improved the tensile strength of as-built IN718/TiC nanocomposite. In
   both as-built IN718/TiC and pure IN718, γ and Laves phase are the major
   constituents while the other precipitates were suppressed by rapid
   solidification in SLM. Heat treatment dissolved Laves precipitates and
   grew γ'/γ'', δ, and MC/ M23C6 carbides that strengthened both pure IN718
   and IN718/TiC nanocomposite. In heat-treated IN718/TiC, the TiC
   nanoparticles and M23C6 carbides degenerated from TiC counteracted the
   deficiency of δ precipitates. Therefore, heat-treated IN718/TiC
   nanocomposite had similar tensile strength but lower ductility than
   heat-treated pure IN718.

AB Traditionally, material design and property modifications are usually
   associated with compositional changes. Yet, subtle changes in the
   manufacturing process parameters can also have a dramatic effect on the
   resulting material properties. In this work, an integrated computational
   materials engineering (ICME) framework is adopted to tailor the fatigue
   performance of a Ni-based superalloy, RR1000. An existing fatigue model
   is used to identify microstructural features that promote enhanced
   fatigue life, namely a uniform, fine grain size distribution, random
   orientation, a distinct grain boundary distribution (specifically high
   twin boundary density and limited low-angle grain boundaries). A
   deformation mechanism map and process models for grain boundary
   engineering of RR1000 are used to identify the optimal thermo-mechanical
   processing parameters to realize these desirable microstructural
   features. For validation, small-scale forgings of RR1000 were produced
   and heat-treated to attain fine grain and coarse grain microstructures
   that represent the conventionally processed and grain boundary
   engineered (GBE) conditions, respectively. For each of the four
   microstructural variants of RR1000, the twin density and grain size were
   characterized and were in agreement with the desired microstructural
   attributes. In order to validate the deformation mechanisms and fatigue
   behavior of the material, high-resolution digital image correlation was
   performed to generate strain maps relative to the microstructural
   features. The high density of twin boundaries was confirmed to inhibit
   the length of slip bands, which is directly attributed to extended
   fatigue life. Thus, this study demonstrated the successful role of
   models, both process and performance, in the design and manufacture of
   Ni-based superalloy disk forgings.

AB Oxide dispersion strengthened Alloy 617 was prepared by mechanical

   treatment was evaluated by XRD, SEM and TEM. It was revealed that the
   dominant precipitates in the solution-annealed sample were Cr-rich M23C6
   and M6C precipitates on grain boundaries, and Al-O, Y-Al-O and Y-Ti-O
   nano-particles in grain interior. Different from a conventional Alloy
   617, TiN and TiC precipitates were not found. Aging at 760 degrees C for
   100 h showed that gamma' were not formed, possibly due to the high
   affinity of O to Al and Ti, which suppressed the formation TiN, TiC and
   gamma'. Heat treatment at high temperatures showed that M23C6 and
   Y2Ti2O7 were stable up to 1300 degrees C, while most Al-O nano-particles
   evolved into Y-Al-O. The high thermal stability of fine Y2Ti2O7
   particles with a high number density is expected to contribute to a
   superior high temperature mechanical strength than gamma' precipitates.

   different laser beam power densities between 63 and 331 kW/cm(2), and
   scanning laser beam speed ranged from 5 to 100 m/min. It was found that
   laser heat treatment of Waspaloy causes decrease in material
   hardness-the microhardness in laser tracks is about 300 HV0,1 while the
   microhardness of substrate is ranged from 300 to 600 HV0,1-which is a
   positive phenomenon for laser-assisted machining of investigated
   material. Impacts of laser heat treatment parameters on laser tracks
   properties were identified for obtaining multiple laser tracks with the
   most homogenous thickness. Moreover, roughness of heated layers was
   measured to specify surface quality after laser heat treatment. Multiple
   laser tracks were produced using different scanning laser beam speed and
   distances between laser tracks ranged from 0.125 to 1 mm. It was found
   that if scanning laser beam speed is 75 m/min and distance between laser
   tracks is equal to or lower than 0.25 mm, in microstructures of multiple
   laser tracks, cracks are occurring. The most suitable laser heat
   parameters for obtaining heated layers, and which can be used for
   laser-assisted machining, were identified as laser beam power density
   178.3 kW/cm(2), scanning laser beam speed 5 m/min, and distance between

   obtained for both the interlayers having 50 and 100 A mu m thicknesses
   under all the furnace atmospheres. The specimens bonded under vacuum
   condition showed the highest shear strength, failure energy, and
   ductility. Also, the joint produced under argon gas atmosphere using
   100-A mu m-thick filler metal showed a good strength and may be
   acceptable in many applications. However, the specimens bonded under air
   atmosphere were weak, due to their further cavities and non-dissolved
   carbides. The presence of non-dissolved carbides in the
   diffusion-affected zone resulted in increasing the hardness of the base
   metal near the interface. The carbides were dissolved and the hardness
   of the diffusion-affected zone was reduced under vacuum condition
   compared to argon and air atmospheres. The best result was obtained for
   the specimen joined using the 50-A mu m-thick interlayer under vacuum
   atmosphere, with about 95.8 pct joint efficiency.

   these alloys does not contain any such additions. The second generation
   of the alloys contains around 3-6% Re. These additions and modifications
   have been found to improve the temperature capability of the CMSX,
   though there are limitations in their addition. In this article the
   microstructural developments, the metallurgical and high temperature

   fabricated through electron beam melting (EBM) is investigated. Material
   was tested both parallel and perpendicular (transverse) to the build

   performed similarly or exceeded the LCF life of wrought Inconel 718
   plate and bar stock under fully reversed strain-controlled loading at
   650 degrees C. Amongst the textures, the columnar grains oriented
   parallel to the build direction exhibited the highest life on average
   compared to the transverse columnar and equiax EBM material. Further, in
   relation to the reference wrought material the parallel columnar grain
   material exhibited a greater life. While a negligible life difference
   was observed in the equiax grained material between the two
   orientations, a consistently lower accumulated inelastic strain was
   measured for the material loaded parallel to the build direction than
   the transverse orientation. Failure of the parallel columnar material
   occurred in a transgranular manner with cracks emanating from the
   surface whereas the transverse columnar material failed in a
   intergranular manner, with crack growth occurring through repeated
   rupture of oxide at the crack-tip. In the case of the equiax material,
   an influence of material orientation was not observed on the failure
   mechanism with crack propagation occurring through a combination of
   debondedicracked carbides and void formation along twin boundaries
   resulting in a mixture of intergranular and transgranular crack
   propagation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   Alloy 718 onto an EN 1.4401 stainless steel substrate in terms of
   secondary phase formation, dilution and hardness. A columnar
   solidification structure with elongated grains growing in the direction
   normal to the substrate was observed for all parameters. In the
   interdendritic regions, phases with a high content of Niobium were
   identified. Scanning Electron Microscopy imaging and Energy Dispersive
   Spectroscopy measurements revealed these phases to most likely be Laves
   phase and Nb-carbides. Temperature measurements indicated no significant
   aging in the deposits. Considerable enrichment of iron was found in the
   initially deposited layers due to dilution from the substrate. The
   increased content of iron seemed to aid in forming constituents rich in
   niobium which, in turn, influenced the hardness. The highest mean
   hardness was noted in the sample with the lowest area fraction of
   Nb-rich constituents. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   alloys were investigated after heat treatment. The microstructure and
   the elevated temperature mechanical properties of laser fabricated IN718
   alloys were analyzed. The results showed that the microstructure of
   laser fabricated IN718 alloy consisted of austenitic matrix and
   dendritic Laves/gamma eutectic. Most all Laves/gamma eutectic was
   dissolved into austenitic matrix, and the complete recrystallization and
   the large grains occurred in the laser fabricated IN718 alloy after
   homogenization at 1080-1140 degrees C for 1 h, the dendritic Laves/gamma
   eutectic was refined and the partial recrystallization occurred during
   the solid solution at 940-1000 degrees C for 1.5 h, the microhardness of
   the double aging (DA) alloys was about more than twice that of
   as-fabricated IN718 alloy. The recrystallized microstructure was
   obtained in the heat-treated laser fabricated IN718 alloy after 1100
   degrees C/1 h air cooling (AC), 980 degrees C/1.5 h (AC), 700 degrees
   C/8 h furnace cooling (FC, 100 C/h) to 600 degrees C/8 h (AC). The
   microhardness and the elevated temperature tensile strength were more
   than twice that of as-fabricated IN718 alloy due to a large
   concentration of gamma '' phase precipitation to improve the
   transgranular strength and large grain to guarantee the grain boundary
   strength. The fracture morphologies of as-fabricated and heat-treated
   laser fabricated IN718 alloys were presented as the fiber dimples, the

   (SEM). The composition of different regions on the surface was tested by
   energy dispersive X-ray (EDS). The reaction intermetallic compound (IMC)
   formed in the heat treatment process was confirmed by X-ray diffraction
   (XRD). The orientations of different microstructure in samples as heat
   treatment state were determined by electron back-scattering diffraction
   (EBSD) method. The porosity location in the interdendritic region was
   observed by X-ray computed tomography (XCT).
   The experiment results showed that the remained Sn on the surface of the

   this investigation, an intermediate Ni-CeO2 layer was electrodeposited
   on the surface of Rene 80 nickel-based superalloy before pack

   layer was carried out using direct current and Watts nickel
   electroplating bath containing 30 g/lit nano ceria particles.
   Electrodeposited specimens were aluminized in a powder mixture of
   aluminum, ammonium chloride, and alumina by a two-step treatment at 760
   and 1040 degrees C to form an inward growth-type coating. Cross sections
   of the coated specimens were studied by means of scanning electron
   microscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy and X-ray diffractometry. The
   results showed that after aluminizing the composite intermediate layer
   converts to an Al-rich NiAI layer with a porous and CeO2-free surface
   zone below which a CeO2-containing layer exists. Three-zone
   microstructure of two-step aluminide coatings on nickel-based
   superalloys was observed below the CeO2-containing layer. The mechanism
   of coating formation was discussed. The oxidation resistance of the CeO2
   modified coating in 10 five-hour cycles at 1050 degrees C was
   considerably better than the unmodified coating.

AB In the present study, samples fabricated by varying the deposition hatch
   length during selective laser melting of nickel based superalloy Inconel
   718 were investigated. Microstructure and texture of these samples was
   characterized using scanning electron microscopy, combined with electron
   back-scattered diffraction, and residual stress assessment, using
   neutron diffraction method. Textured columnar grains oriented along the
   sample building direction were observed in the shorter hatch length
   processed sample. A ten-fold increase in the hatch length reduced the
   texture intensity by a factor of two attributed to the formation of
   finer grains in the longer hatch length sample. Larger gradients of
   transverse residual stress in the longer hatch length sample were also
   observed. Along the build direction, compressive stresses in the shorter
   hatch length and negligible stresses for the longer hatch length
   specimen were observed. Changes to the temperature gradient (G) in
   response to the hatch length variation, influenced the G to growth rate
   (R) ratio and the product GxR, in agreement with the microstructures and
   textures formed. For the residual stress development, geometry of the
   part also played an important role. In summary, tailored isotropy could
   be induced in Inconel 718 by a careful selection of parameters during
   selective laser melting. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The grain growth behaviors of a nickel-based superalloy after full
   recrystallization are investigated by hot compression test plus
   annealing treatment. Electron backscattered diffraction technology
   (EBSD) is utilized to analyze the grain boundary features. It is found
   that the annealing parameters greatly affect the average grain size, and
   annealing twin boundaries, including Sigma 3, Sigma 9, and Sigma 27
   boundaries. The fully-recrystallized grains can rapidly grow up at
   relatively high annealing temperatures with the increase of annealing
   time. Meanwhile, large fractions of annealing twin boundaries form at
   the initial stage of annealing treatment. However, with the further
   increase of annealing time, the content of annealing twins slightly
   drops due to the migration of grain boundaries or twin boundaries. When
   the annealing temperature is increased, the shape of annealing twin is
   apparently lengthened while the number of annealing twin sharply
   decreases. In addition, the kinetics model for grain growth after full
   recrystallization is established and validated by the experimental
   observations. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

PY 2017
AB The microstructure of a transient liquid phase (TLP) bonded nickel base
   superalloy using B-containing filler metal after completion of
   isothermal solidification can usually be described by a eutectic-free
   joint centerline with extensive in-situ boride precipitation in the
   diffusion affected zone which in turn can affect the joint properties.
   Therefore, designing a proper post-bond heat treatment is needed to
   produce a robust joint. This paper addresses the microstructure
   evolution mechanism during post-bond heat treatment (PBHT) of TLP bonded
   wrought IN718 nickel base superalloy. PBHT at 1150 degrees C, which is
   lower than the solvus temperature of the borides, for 12 h resulted in
   boride-free joint with uniform chemical composition and enhanced aging
   response. The microstructure evolution of the bond during PBHT was
   featured by fragmentation, break up and dissolution of Cr-Mo-Nb rich
   borides. The dissolution of the borides at a temperature lower than
   their initial solvus temperature can be attributed to the modification
   of boride composition during diffusion-induced homogenization process
   associated with PBHT. Increasing PBHT time resulted in enhanced
   contribution of solid solution strengthening in the joint centerline and
   stronger response to aging treatment due to alloying elements
   homogenization. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Oxidation and corrosion can attack superalloy disk surfaces exposed to
   increasing operating temperatures in some turbine engine environments.
   Any potential protective coatings must also be resistant to harmful
   fatigue cracking during service. The objective of this study was to
   investigate how residual stresses evolve in one such coating. Fatigue
   specimens of a powder metallurgy-processed disk superalloy were coated
   with a NiCrY coating, shot peened, and then subjected to fatigue in air
   at room and high temperatures. The effects of this processing and
   fatigue cycling on axial residual stresses and other aspects of the
   coating were assessed. While shot peening did induce beneficial
   compressive residual stresses in the coating and substrate, these
   stresses relaxed in the coating with subsequent heating. Several cast
   alloys having compositions near the coating were subjected to thermal
   expansion and tensile stress relaxation tests to help explain this
   response of residual stresses in the coating. For the coated fatigue
   specimens, this response contributed to earlier cracking of the coating
   than for the uncoated surface during long intervals of cycling at 760
   degrees C. Yet, substantial compressive residual stresses still remained
   in the substrate adjacent to the coating, which were sufficient to
   suppress fatigue cracking there. The coating continued to protect the
   substrate from hot corrosion pitting, even after fatigue cracks
   initiated in the coating.

AB Microstructure evolution and wear resistance of Stellite 12 produced by

   conditions. In untreated conditions, cobalt matrix dendrites and
   interdendritic eutectic carbides were the primary microstructure, blocky
   and lamellar eutectic carbides can be found, and M7C3 and M23C6 are the
   primary carbides. Heat treatment can modify the microstructure of this
   alloy. Primary carbides were dissolved into the cobalt matrix after
   solution treatment. Aging treatment resulted in the precipitation of
   carbides, the transformation of M7C3 into M23C6 carbides, and the
   increase in microhardness. Solution and aging treatment can also cause
   the precipitation of carbides, but the morphology and distribution of
   carbides were absolutely different. The wear resistance of untreated
   samples at room temperature (RT) and 600 degrees C is better than that
   at 200 and 400 degrees C due to the high hardness at RT and the
   formation of oxide film at 600 degrees C. The wear resistance of
   heat-treated samples was tested at 600 degrees C; it was dominated by
   the formation and flake-off of oxide film. The sample that underwent
   solution plus aging treatment has a superior wear resistance.

AB gamma/gamma' eutectics' nucleation behavior during the solidification of

   existing gamma dendrites, directly in the remaining liquid, or on the
   primary MC-type carbides. The gamma/gamma' eutectics formed through the
   latter two mechanisms have different crystal orientations than that of
   the gamma matrix. This suggests that the conventional Ni-based
   single-crystal superalloy castings with additional carbon only guarantee
   the monocrystallinity of the gamma matrix and some gamma/gamma'

   recrystallization, only when the initial dynamically recrystallized

   24 h and 100 h) to evaluate the impact of microstructure degradation on
   VHCF fracture mechanisms and lifetime. At ratio of R = -1, crack
   initiation at internal casting pore and subsequent planar slip
   propagation is systematically observed for all investigated
   microstructure. At ratio of R = 0.8, crack initiation occurs from
   multiple internal or subsurface pores. Mode I micro-propagation is
   observed and associated with the addition of a large mean stress. In
   specimens prior crept-deformed in tension, the density of micro-cracks
   is higher due to the precipitation coarsening. Moreover, the crack
   propagation path is affected by the morphology of the gamma/'gamma'

AB Combustor liners of airplane gas turbine engines experience premature
   thermo-mechanical fatigue-creep (TMFC) failure under operational loading
   conditions. The loading history of combustor liners encompass
   temperature fluctuation between ambient to as high as 1000 degrees C,
   and concurrent strain or stress fluctuation with load peak dwell-periods
   of 30 min to as long as 16 h of flying time. Repetition of such an
   anisothermal loading history leads to crack initiation in components via
   TMFC damage accumulation processes. In an effort to investigate such
   TMFC failures, a set of anisothermal experiments, both in-phase and
   out-of-phase, with peak dwell periods, were carried out for Haynes 230,
   a nickel-based superalloy used in constructing combustor liners.
   Analysis of the responses from out-of-phase experiments with compression
   dwells show mean-stress evolution in the tensile direction, while that
   from in-phase experiments with tensile dwells show mean-stress evolution
   in the compression direction. The total stress relaxation during peak
   strain dwell in the TIVIFC loading in general decreases with cycle,
   whereas that in the isothermal low-cycle fatigue-creep (LCFC) increases
   with cycle. The cyclic hardening-softening response is found to depend
   on the maximum temperature in the TMFC loading cycle. While calculating
   the inelastic strain in the experiments, it was found that the time
   derivative of the elastic modulus needed to be considered to prevent
   anomalous shifting of the hysteresis loops with cycles. The fatigue
   lives in the TMFC experiments are adversely affected by higher maximum
   temperatures and longer dwell-periods. These experimental responses are
   presented and analyzed, and challenges in developing a unified
   constitutive model for simulation of these responses are identified. (C)

AB The segregation behavior of alloy elements in nicked-based superalloy
   ingots during electron beam smelting was investigated. Three series of
   experiments were carried out with different parameters. The
   micromorphology of the cross section of the ingot and the distribution
   of alloy elements in the ingot were analyzed. The results show that the
   melt solidified at the bottom and formed a region of equiaxed grain at
   the beginning of solidification; the columnar crystal is formed in the
   middle of ingot with the proceeding of solidification; the region with
   large grains is formed at the end of the solidification. The segregation
   of alloy elements is weak during solidification after the nickel-based
   superalloy is smelted for 10 min with a power of 9 kW. That is, Ni, Ti,
   Mo and Al show positive segregation with effective segregation
   coefficient value of 0.994, 0.982, 0.995 and 0.884, respectively; Cr, Co
   and W show negative segregation with effective segregation coefficient
   value of 1.051, 1.005 and 1.013, respectively. With the increasing of
   smelting power and time, the segregation degree of Ni, Cr, Ti, W and Mo
   is increased, the segregation degree of Al is decreased and the
   segregation degree of Co shows little change in the ingot. (C) 2017

AB Numerical simulations are used in this work to investigate aspects of
   microstructure and micro segregation during rapid solidification of a
   Ni-based superalloy in a laser powder bed fusion additive manufacturing
   process. Thermal modeling by finite element analysis simulates the laser
   melt pool, with surface temperatures in agreement with in situ
   thermographic measurements on Inconel 625. Geometric and thermal
   features of the simulated melt pools are extracted and used in
   subsequent mesoscale simulations. Solidification in the melt pool is
   simulated on two length scales. For the multicomponent alloy Inconel
   625, microsegregation between dendrite arms is calculated using the
   Scheil-Gulliver solidification model and DICTRA software. Phase-field
   simulations, using Ni-Nb as a binary analogue to Inconel 625, produced
   microstructures with primary cellular/dendritic arm spacings in
   agreement with measured spacings in experimentally observed
   microstructures and a lesser extent of microsegregation than predicted
   by DICTRA simulations. The composition profiles are used to compare
   thermodynamic driving forces for nucleation against experimentally
   observed precipitates identified by electron and Xray diffraction
   analyses. Our analysis lists the precipitates that may form from FCC
   phase of enriched interdendritic compositions and compares these against
   experimentally observed phases from 1 h heat treatments at two
   temperatures: stress relief at 1143 K (870 degrees C) or homogenization
   at 1423 K (1150 degrees C). Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of Acta

AB Additive manufacturing (AM) technologies are known to allow the
   production of parts with an extreme degree of complexity, enabling
   design and functional part optimization. However, the resulting
   microstructures and mechanical properties of AM materials are not well
   understood due to unique and complex thermal cycles observed during
   processing. This study aims to adjust the microstructure of Inconel 718
   specimens produced by selective laser melting (SLM). The microstructural
   design was achieved through process parameters manipulation and
   post-process heat treatment. The effects of heat treatment on
   microstructure, process induced defects, deformation behaviour and
   failure mechanisms were studied. Directional columnar grained
   microstructure accompanied by interdendritic Laves phases and carbide
   particles was observed in as-processed material. Hot isostatic pressing
   (HIP) improved mechanical properties, which was attributed to
   dissolution of undesirable Laves and delta-phase as well as pore
   closure. All investigated samples maintained their intended tailored
   microstructural build up with distinct differences in mechanical
   properties. The results presented in this study show the capability of
   the SLM process to produce parts with mechanical properties better than
   conventional Inconel material. The microstructural design demonstrated
   here can be exploited in AM fabrication of complex components requiring
   challenging high-temperature mechanical performance.

AB Brazing of a Ni-based single crystal superalloy has been investigated
   with the additive Ni-based superalloy and filler Ni-Cr-W-B alloy at 1260
   degrees C, and attentions were paid to the microstructure evolution
   during brazing and the stress-rupture behavior at 980 degrees C of such
   brazed joints after homogenization. Microstructure in the brazed joint
   generally includes brazing alloy zone (BAZ), isothermally solidified
   zone (ISZ) and diffusion affected zone (DAZ). Microstructure evolution
   during this brazing process is discussed at the heating stage, the
   holding stage and the cooling stage respectively, according to the
   diffusion path of B atoms. Initially well-distributed gamma/gamma'
   microstructure in the homogenized bonded zone after heat treatment and
   substantial gamma' rafts enhance the post-brazed joint to obtain a
   stress-rupture lifetime of more than 120 h at 980 degrees C/250 MPa. On
   the other hand, the decreased stress-rupture behavior of post-brazed
   joint, compared with parenting material, is ascribed to the presence of
   inside brazing porosity and stray grain boundary, which not only reduces
   the effective loading-carrying area but also offers preferential sites
   for creep vacancy aggregation to further soften stray grain boundary.
   And finally an early fracture of these post-brazed joints through the
   intergranular microholes aggregation and growth mode under this testing
   condition was observed. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of

AB Superalloy Inconel 625 has been widely used in selective laser melting
   (SLM). Since SLM-induced microstructure with columnar grains, strong
   texture, porosity, and undesired properties, heat treatment is often
   used to tune the microstructure and mechanical properties. However, the
   microstructure evolution of IN 625 from SLM to heat treatment is poorly
   understood. In this study, IN 625 samples were SLMed and then heat
   treated at elevated temperatures. Microstructure evolution
   characteristics of the processed IN 625 alloy have been characterized
   using optical metallography, scanning electron microscopy (SEM),
   electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), transmission electron
   microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction, and micro indentation. Fine
   dendrite microstructures with strong texture parallel to layer build-up
   direction was observed in the as-SLM samples due to rapid cooling and
   epitaxial growth. High dislocation density and high microhardness were
   found in the gamma matrix which also contains high Z-contrast
   precipitates. After annealing at high temperatures, random grain growth
   accompanied by dislocation annihilation and twinning occurs. The
   decrease in lattice parameter and the prevalence of large grain boundary
   misorientation in the gamma matrix suggests that SLM-induced residual
   stress be significantly reduced. In addition, the uncertainty of
   mechanical properties due to the process variations was quantified.

AB Influence of solution treatment (ST) on microstructure evolution and
   mechanical behavior of nickel-based UNS N10276 alloy were investigated
   by a variety of techniques such as optical metallography, scanning
   electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and tensile
   testing. The average grain size remained almost unaffected by hold time
   at 1050 C, resulting from the pinning effect of secondary phase on the
   grain boundary. A sharp increase in grain size and grain growth rate was
   observed with increasing solutionizing temperature up to 1150 C
   irrespective of hold time, which was mainly related to the complete
   dissolution of precipitated particles as well as to the enhanced
   diffusion of solute atoms. The rate of grain growth reduced with
   extending solutionizing time and decreasing temperature. Flow curve
   parameters based on Ludwigson equation for the alloy after heat
   treatment were determined. The dissolution of secondary phase particles,
   combined with the grain growth, increased the work hardening exponent
   (n) and dramatically improved the tensile ductilities (TD), but reduced
   the tensile strengths (TS) to large extent. Both TD and n monotonically
   increased with increasing solutionizing temperature and prolonging hold
   time as the alloy was solutionized beyond 1100 degrees C, while the TS
   and strain hardening rate (SHR) showed a reverse varying trend to that
   of TD and n. As the heat treatment was performed at 1050 degrees C,
   tensile properties were not monotonically changing with hold time, which
   is associated with the increase in amount of precipitates and with the
   Ostwald ripening of precipitated particles. On the basis of Hall-Petch
   relation and experimental data, the mathematical relationships between
   tensile properties and grain size of the alloy solutionized at
   temperatures higher than 1150 C, were obtained by linear regression
   analysis. The Hall-Petch strengthening coefficient for yield strength of
   the UNS N10276 alloy was estimated to be 18.35 MPa mm(1/2).

AB Cast IN617B alloy, a nickel-based superalloy, is considered as a

   Microstructural evolution and mechanical properties of solution annealed
   cast IN617B alloy during the long-term thermal exposure at 700 degrees C
   are systematically investigated. The results show that Ti (C, N), M6C
   and M23C6 are the primary precipitates in as-cast microstructure, and
   most of them completely dissolved after solution heat treatment. The
   major precipitates in the thermal exposed microstructure are M23C6, M6C
   and gamma' phases, and a trace amount of a phases are also detected
   within grains. By comparison with previous studies on wrought IN617B
   alloy, it is identified that the processing method exerts a significant
   influence on the morphology of M23C6 carbides within grains. Moreover,
   the microstructure observation reveals that the growth of M23C6
   facilitates the formation of gamma' by enriching gamma'-formation
   elements, and conversely, dense gamma' phase inhibites the coarsening
   and transformation of M23C6 by constraining the diffusion of
   M23C6-formation elements. The tensile strength of 700 C improves
   strikingly due to the precipitation strengthening of gamma' phases and
   carbides while the ductility decreases noticeably. The significant
   coarsening of carbides on grain boundaries (GBs) results in the fracture
   mechanism evolution during long-term thermal exposure.

   and gas 718 heat treatment, the aerospace 718 heat treatment, and two
   variant two-step heat treatments, with a difference in aging heat
   treatment named 718 low band and high band. Each heat treatment leads to
   differences in the precipitate morphologies of gamma', gamma" and delta
   phases.
   Material characterisation and fractography of the examined heat
   treatments were performed using a high resolution FEG SEM. Three
   specimens of each condition were pre-charged with hydrogen and tensile
   properties were compared with those of non-charged specimens. It was
   observed that hydrogen embrittlement was associated with intergranular
   and transgranular microcrack formation, leading to an intergranular
   brittle fracture. 8 phase may assist the intergranular crack
   propagation, and this was shown to be particularly true when this phase
   is coarse enough to produce crack initiation, but this is not the only
   factor determining embrittlement. Other microstructural features play a
   role, as does the strength of the material. The aerospace heat
   treatment, which gives the highest strength and ductility in the
   uncharged state, shows the greatest reduction in properties with
   hydrogen charging. (C) 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published

AB Inconel 713C precision castings are used as aircraft engine components
   exposed to high temperatures and the aggressive exhaust gas environment.
   Industrial experience has shown that precision-cast components of such
   complexity contain casting defects like microshrinkage, porosity, and
   cracks. This necessitates the development of repair technologies for
   castings of this type. This paper presents the results of metallographic
   examinations of melted areas and clad welds on the Inconel 713C
   nickel-based superalloy, made by TIG, plasma arc, and laser. The
   cladding process was carried out on model test plates in order to
   determine the technological and materialrelated problems connected with
   the weldability of Inconel 713C. The studies included analyses of the
   macro-and microstructure of the clad welds, the base materials, and the
   heat-affected zones. The results of the structural analyses of the clad
   welds indicate that Inconel 713C should be classified as a
   low-weldability material. In the clad welds made by laser, cracks were
   identified mainly in the heat-affected zone and at the melted zone
   interface, crystals were formed on partially-melted grains. Cracks of
   this type were not identified in the clad welds made using the
   plasma-arc method. It has been concluded that due to the possibility of
   manual cladding and the absence of welding imperfections, the technology
   having the greatest potential for application is plasma-arc cladding.

   and broke down the continuous feature of eutectic phases formed from the
   residual liquid phase during terminal solidification. The eutectics
   consisted of mainly discrete Laves phases and small portion of NbC. The
   discrete Laves phases contributed to the good solidification behavior of
   the Inconel 718 build. After solution annealing and two-step aging
   treatment, partial recrystallization occurred and resulted in the
   nucleation of small equiaxed grains. Laves phase dissolved and 5 phase
   with needle-like shape formed. Precipitates also developed through the

   microscopy (TEM), electron probe micro-analysis (EPMA), and electron
   backscatter diffraction (EBSD). Extensive formation of eutectic
   solidification microconstituents including Laves and MC-type carbide
   phases, induced by micro-segregation, are observed in the build of the
   alloy in the as-deposited condition. Notwithstanding the significant
   segregation of niobium (Nb), which has been reported to promote the
   formation of the delta-phase in ATI 718Plus, only eta-phase particles
   are observed in the deposit. Excessive precipitation of eta-phase
   particles is found to be linked to Laves phase particles that are
   partially dissolved in the deposit after post-deposition heat treatment
   (PDHT). The EBSD analysis shows a high textured build in the aOE (c) 100
   > directions with only a few misoriented grains at the substrate-deposit
   boundary and the top of the deposit. Investigation on the hardness of
   the build of the alloy, in the as-deposited condition, showed a softened
   zone about 2 mm wide at the deposited metal heat affected zone (DMHAZ),
   which has not been previously reported and potentially damaging to the
   mechanical properties. An extensive analysis with the use of both
   microstructural characterization tools and theoretical calculations
   shows that the DMHAZ has the lowest volume fraction of strengthening
   precipitates (gamma' and gamma aEuro(3)) in terms of their number
   density, which therefore induces the observed softness. Delayed
   re-precipitation kinetics and the extent of the precipitation of gamma'
   and gamma aEuro(3) in the DMHAZ which is related to the diffusion of
   segregated solute elements from the interdendritic regions are
   attributed to this phenomenon. The microstructural analyses discussed in
   this work are vital to adequate understanding of properties of ATI
   718Plus produced by the additive manufacturing process technique.

AB Fatigue crack growth under large scale yielding condition is studied for
   a commercial base Co superalloys, Haynes (R) 188, for single edge notch
   (SENT) specimen. Due to very high temperature and applied strain values,
   it is observed that major crack interacts with micro-cracks pattern.
   These micro-cracks are found to be associated to strain localization and
   local high triaxiality stress ratio. Detailed analysis of strain
   localization and stress concentration was used to define an optimal
   characteristic length used in a non-local modeling of strain energy
   involved in crack growth process. To obtain robust and low time
   consuming crack growth modeling, a post-processing methodology is thus
   proposed for fatigue crack growth under large scale yielding. This point
   was successfully achieved for SENT specimen test series to describe
   crack growth rate. Finally, test driven for another geometry has enabled
   to validate the proposed modeling methodology. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The aim of this study was to gain a deep understanding of the
   microstructure-mechanical relationship between solid-state sintering and
   full-melting processes. The IN718 superalloy was fabricated by hot
   isostatic pressing (HIP) and selective laser melting (SLM). Continuous
   precipitates were clearly localized along the prior particle boundary
   (PPB) in the HIP materials, while SLM materials showed a microstructure
   free of PPB. The mechanical properties of specimens that underwent SLM +
   solution treatment and aging were comparable to those of conventional
   wrought specimens both at room temperature and 650 degrees C. However, a
   drop was observed in the ductility of HIP material at 650 degrees C. The
   brittle particles along the PPB were found to affect the HIP materials'
   creep life and ductility during solid-state sintering.

   temperatures for greater efficiency. Their use extends the lifetime of
   the superalloy blades that bear thermal gradients and mechanical loads

   was conducted to investigate the stresses within the thermally grown
   oxide of a thermal barrier coated tubular sample following complex
   realistic conditions, such as induced thermal gradients, and long
   duration aging. The resulting high,spatial resolution stress contour
   maps highlight the development of the thermally grown oxide in response
   to the complex conditions. The outcomes highlight both the role of the
   aging process and the oxide growth's influence on the stress profile
   which varies spatially across the specimen. The results further provide
   early detection of micro-damaged zones in the oxide layer
   nondestructively. Improving the understanding of the coating system's
   response to loading conditions will allow for more accurate system

AB Bimetal-layer surfacing intensifying the working area of die by welding
   materials with gradient mechanical properties is an effective
   fabrication and refabrication technology for hot forging dies with low
   cost and a short cycle. Owing to the extremely high operating
   temperature and large stress of large hot forging dies, the selection of
   welding materials is quite important. In consideration of the excellent
   high-temperature performance of cobalt-based superalloy, a cobalt-based
   superalloy welding material, Co03 was designed in this study to be
   combined with ferrous alloys with outstanding low-temperature mechanical
   properties and low price to realized effective refabrication of large
   hot forging dies by bimetal-layer surfacing. Refabrication of dies and
   subsequent hot forging processes were simulated physically by
   bimetal-layer welding conducted on 5CrNiMo blocks and heat treatments.
   Compared with the combination of two ferrous alloys (JXHC30 and JXHC15),
   the combination of Co03 and JXHC15 exhibited more stable microstructure
   and mechanical properties in extreme operating conditions. To verify the
   feasibility of the combination of JXHC15 and Co03 in refabrication of
   hot forging dies through bimetal-layer surfacing, a pair of large hot
   forging dies were refabricated and employed in forging production. The
   service lives of refabricated dies were improved by dozens of times,
   compared with the former homogeneous 5CrNiMo dies. (C) 2017 Elsevier

AB Tensile properties of a novel Co-20Cr-5Al-2.4Hf-1.5Y(2)O(3) (wt%) oxide
   dispersion strengthened (ODS) superalloy were studied through a
   comparing investigation with Co-20Cr-5Al (wt%) alloy. Both the Co-based
   alloys (with and without oxide particles) were fabricated by mechanical
   alloying (MA), spark plasma sintering (SPS), hot rolling and the final
   annealing at 1200 degrees C. Due to the ultrafine grains of 500 nm in
   the ODS superalloy and 1.2 mu m in the ODS free alloy, the metastable
   fcc structure predominates at room temperature. Tensile testing was
   conducted at room temperature and 1000 degrees C. Strain-induced
   twinning deformation was evidenced by transmission electron microscopy
   and was found to significantly enhance the ultimate tensile strength
   (UTS) of the two alloys at room temperature. The Co-based ODS superalloy
   exhibits a superior tensile strength of 2.85 GPa at room temperature,
   which is associated with the distribution of twins and fine Y-Hf oxides.
   At 1000 degrees C, since the ultrafine grain size in the ODS
   superalloys, an easy grain boundary deformation occurred and resulted in
   a significant reduction in the UTS value. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All

AB Two batches of pre-alloyed Hastelloy-X powder with different Si, Mn and
   C contents were used to produce specimens by Selective Laser Melting
   (SLM). Cracks with various morphologies were found in some of the parts.
   Two major reasons that control crack formation and propagation were
   considered: (i) internal strain accumulation due to the thermal cycling
   that is characteristic to SLM processing; (ii) crack formation and
   propagation during solidification. This phenomenon, known as hot
   tearing, is frequently found in conventional casting and is dependent on
   chemical composition. Using thermodynamic software simulation, the
   temperature vs fraction of solid curves was used to determine hot
   tearing sensitivity as a function of Si, Mn and C content. It was found
   that low Si and C contents help in avoiding crack formation whereas
   cracking propensity was relatively independent of Mn concentration.
   Hence, the cracking mechanism during SLM is believed to be as follows:
   crack initiation is mainly induced during solidification and is
   dependent on the content of minor alloying elements such as Si and C,
   whereas crack propagation predominantly occurs during thermal cycling.
   If microstructures free of micro-cracks after solidification can be
   generated with optimised SLM parameters, these manufactured parts can
   sustain the internal strain level and, thus, crack formation and
   propagation can be avoided. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The equilibrium reaction between Ni alloys and CaO-Al2O3-CaF2-TiO2
   system electroslag remelting (ESR) slags was investigated in the
   temperature range of 1773 K to 1873 K (1500 A degrees C to 1600 A
   degrees C) at p(O-2) = 10(-16) atm in order to obtain the optimized
   composition of the slags for producing Ni alloys with various Al and Ti
   ratios. In addition, the temperature dependence of the reaction
   equilibria between the ESR slags and Ni alloys was also evaluated. The
   stable ionic species of titanium in the ESR slag under the present
   experimental conditions was experimentally confirmed to be mainly Ti4+
   (i.e., TiO2) by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis of the
   quenched samples. The activity-composition relationship of TiO2 and
   Al2O3 in the ESR slag was determined as a function of the Al/Ti ratio of
   the alloys and the CaF2 content of the slags in conjunction with the
   activity ratio of Al to Ti in the alloys calculated from the
   FactSage(TM) 7.0 software. The temperature dependence of the
   activity-composition relationship of TiO2 and Al2O3 in the slag showed
   good linear correlations, and the equilibrium content ratio of TiO2 to
   Al2O3 at a fixed activity ratio increased with increasing temperature,
   which was expected based on the standard enthalpy change of the
   reaction. Thus, higher amounts of TiO2 should be added at higher
   operation temperatures in the ESR process. A 120 kg scale pilot ESR test
   (2000 A and 16 V) was performed to produce a commercial grade Ni-based
   superalloy based on the activity-composition relationship of the slag
   components obtained in the present study. Consequently, the contents of
   Al and Ti in the solidified ESR ingot were nearly the same as that of
   the original electrode throughout the entire length (280 mm) after the
   ESR process. (C) The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society and ASM

AB Traditional manufacturing of Inconel 718 components from castings and

   machining to attain the desired geometry. Additive manufacturing (AM)
   technologies including direct energy deposition (DED), selective laser
   melting (SLM), electron beam melting (EBM) and binder jet 3D printing
   (BJ3DP) can minimize scrap generation and reduce lead times. While there
   is extensive literature on the use of melting and solidification based
   AM technologies, there has been limited research on the use of binder
   jet 3D printing. In this paper, a brief review on binder jet additive
   manufacturing of Inconel 718 is presented. In addition, existing
   knowledge on sintering of Inconel 718 has been extended to binder jet 3D
   printing. We found that supersolidus liquid phase sintering (SLPS) is
   necessary to achieve full densification of Inconel 718. SLPS is
   sensitive to the feedstock chemistry that has a strong influence on the
   liquid volume fraction at the processing temperature. Based on these
   results, we discuss an empirical framework to determine the role of
   powder particle size and liquid volume fraction on sintering kinetics.
   The role of powder packing factor and binder saturation on
   microstructural evolution is discussed. The current challenges in the
   use of BJ3DP for fabrication of Inconel 718, as well as, extension to
   other metal systems, are presented. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB The carbides evolution affected by heating will have great effect on the
   mechanical property of welded components. The paper focused on the
   microstructure characterization and carbides evolution under different
   thermal cycle in narrow-gap tungsten inert gas welding (NG-TIG) on Alloy
   617B. The carbides were characterized to be M23C6 by TEM in 617B base
   metal (BM), which distribute along the grain boundaries and within the
   grains in roughly similar size and characteristics. However, many kinds
   of multi-carbides and various characteristics were found in heat
   affected zone (HAZ) with different distance to fusion line, which
   contributed to different heating peak temperatures (T-p). As the T-p
   reaches the solvus temperature of M23C6 carbides, M23C6 carbides show
   partial dissolution and M6C will form at the interface gamma/M23C6 due
   to the segregation of element Mo. Upon the eutectic temperature, the
   surviving M23C6 carbides react with the surrounding gamma matrix and
   then it leads to the formation of liquid film. Some phases with lamellar
   structure composed of M6C and M23C6 multi carbides and islands of
   gamma-austenite will occur as the temperature decreases. In addition, a
   large number of fine granular Cr-rich second phases like texturing
   morphology, scattered around each new kind of multi-carbide after the
   post weld heat treatment (PWHT). Basing on the analysis result, it can
   be seen that the evolution behavior of carbides is determined by the
   thermal input during NG-TIG welding process. No adverse effects, such as
   liquation cracking, have been brought into the welded joint due to the
   low thermal input, proving that NG-TIG is a suitable welding method to
   join Alloy 617B.

AB The effect of heat treatment with the aid of a steady magnetic field

   gamma' precipitates and also to delay their splitting in the dendrite
   core, but had no pronounced effect on the morphology of the precipitates
   in the interdendritic region. Measurement of the distribution of
   alloying elements showed that the degree of microsegregation in the
   samples heat treated in the SMF was higher than in those without the
   SMF. It is concluded that the SMF reduced the diffusivity of the
   alloying elements and thus decreased the coarsening rate of the
   precipitates, which led to a reduction of their average size and a delay
   of their splitting. With respect to the mechanical properties it was
   found that the Vickers hardness and the tensile strength of the samples
   after heat treatment in the SMF increased. According to the
   precipitation hardening theory, the Orowan process is the dominating
   deformation mechanism in DZ483 at a high temperature and thus the DZ483

   degrees C, 1000 degrees C, and 1100 degrees C for times up to 3 h.
   Microscopic examination of the interface showed no variations in the
   microstructure after heating at 800 degrees C even at longer times. At
   900 degrees C and 1000 degrees C, the interdiffusion of atoms became
   significant; arrays of carbide precipitates appeared in the
   microstructure on the Hastelloy side which seemed to coarsen with
   increase in temperature and time. At temperatures as high as 1100
   degrees C, 30min of heat treatment resulted in the formation of a
   significant number of coarse carbide precipitates on the Hastelloy side,
   as well as a line of carbides on the steel side. It was concluded that
   these bimetals may not be suitable for application in service
   temperatures higher than 800 degrees C. Even short-time exposure to
   elevated temperatures can develop coarse carbide networks at the

   grains is responsible for large DRX fraction with coarse grains
   microstructure in the low strain rate domain. In contrast, DRX at higher
   strain rates is mainly controlled by the large stored energy along with
   adiabatic temperature rise which leads to higher DRX nucleation. It is
   also noticed that the evolution of twins is greatly influenced by
   deformation temperature at all imposed strain rates. Here, the evolution
   of twins is quantified by measuring twin boundary length fraction and
   length density. The twin-length density increases with increase in DRX
   fraction at low temperatures (< 1423 K) but decreases with increasing
   DRX fraction at high temperatures (>= 1423 K). An exponential rise in
   recrystallized grain size with DRX fraction is observed at a temperature
   >= 1423 K. This suggests that rapid migration of high-angle boundaries
   happened at >= 1423 K which may not be favorable for nucleation of twins
   during DRX.

AB The effect of Ti addition on the cracking and microhardness of Ni-based
   superalloy Inconel 625 during the laser solid forming was investigated.
   With the increase of Ti content, the crack rate decreased till nil
   because of shrunken solidification temperature range and sufficient
   liquid phase healing the solidification cracks by back-filling in the
   terminal solidification stage. The addition of Ti promoted the formation
   of (gamma+Laves) eutectic phase and led to the transformation of
   morphology of the Laves phase from the dotted or short rod to the
   lamellar and massive network. When the content of Ti exceeded 5 wt %,
   the microhardness of the alloys improved by 100 HV compared with the
   alloys containing below 5 wt % Ti addition. The increase in
   microhardness can be mainly ascribed to a network distribution of the
   (gamma+Laves) eutectic phase. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Inconel-625 is a solid solution-strengthened alloy used for

   Different heat treatment cycles (temperatures of 625-1025 degrees C and
   time of 2-6 h) have been studied to obtain optimum mechanical properties
   suitable for a specific application. It has been observed that room
   temperature strength and, hardness decreased and ductility increased
   with increase in heat treatment temperature. The rate of change of these
   properties is found to be moderate for the samples heat-treated up to
   850 degrees C, and thereafter, it increases rapidly. It is attributed to
   the microstructural changes like dissolution of carbides,
   recrystallization and grain growth. Microstructures are found to be
   predominantly single-phase austenitic with the presence of fine alloy
   carbides. The presence of twins is observed in samples heat-treated at
   lower temperature, which act as nucleation sites for recrystallization
   at 775 degrees C. Beyond 850 degrees C, the role of carbides present in
   the matrix is subsided by the coarsening of recrystallized grains and
   finally at 1025 degrees C, significant dissolution of carbide results in
   substantial reduction in strength and increase in ductility. Elongation
   to an extent of > 71% has been obtained in sample heat-treated at 1025
   degrees C indicating excellent tendency for cold workability. Failure of
   heat-treated specimens is found to be mainly due to carbide
   particle-matrix decohesion which acts as locations for crack initiation.

AB Fe-based superalloy Fe-25Ni-15Cr was plasma nitrided at a low

   characterized by optical microscopy (OPM) and scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) through stepwise mechanical
   polishing and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results
   indicated that the double expanded austenite (gamma (N1) and gamma (N2))
   was developed on the nitrided surface. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectrum
   (EDS) revealed that separate expanded austenite layers with distinctly
   different nitrogen contents occurred: high (18.98 to 11.49 at. pct) in
   the surface layer and low (5.87 to 5.32 at. pct) in the subsurface. XRD
   analysis indicated that large lattice expansion and distortion relative
   to the untreated austenite of an idea face-centered-cubic (fcc)
   structure occurred on the gamma (N1), but low expansion and less
   distortion on the gamma (N2). No obvious lattice distortion on the gamma
   (N1) was determined by calculating its electron diffraction pattern
   (EDP), except for detectable lattice expansion. Inconformity between XRD
   and EDP results suggested that the high compressive residual stress in
   the gamma (N1) was mainly responsible for the lattice distortion of the
   gamma (N1). TEM indicated that the gamma (N1) layer exhibited the
   monotonous contrast characteristic of an amorphous phase contrast to
   some extent, and corresponding EDP showed a strong diffuse scattering
   effect. It was suggested that the pre-precipitation took place in the
   gamma (N1) in the form of strongly bonded Cr-N clusters or pairs.
   Decomposition of the gamma (N1) into CrN and gamma occurred at the grain
   boundaries, and the orientation of both phases remained cubic and cubic
   relationship, i.e., the planes and the directions with identical Miller
   indices in both phases were parallel. The nitrided surface was found to
   have significantly improved wear resistance. Further, the nitrided
   surface showed no adverse effect in the corrosion resistance but slight
   improvement in the 3.5 pct NaCl solution.

   From the experimentally obtained flow curves, the effect of deformation
   temperature on the work hardening behaviour is analyzed. Three stage
   behaviour exhibited by the work hardening characteristics is
   considerably influenced by deformation temperature and strain rate. The
   critical stress (sigma(c)) and critical strain (epsilon(c)) for
   triggering dynamic recrystallization determined from the work hardening
   curves is related to Zener-Hollomon parameter through a power law
   relationship. Deformation microstructures investigated by Electron
   Backscattered Diffraction (EBSD) studies highlighted the dominance of
   discontinuous dynamic recrystallization (DDRX) evidenced by
   serrated/bulged grain boundaries and necklace type microstructure,
   although DRX volume fraction is strongly sensitive to deformation
   conditions. Dislocation accumulation studied by grain reference
   orientation deviation (GROD) maps corroborates to the observed

   of 650-850 degrees C, which was mainly related to the formation of M6C
   carbides at the grain boundary as well as to the enhanced DSA effect
   during tensile deformation. Typical intermediate temperature
   embrittlement (ITE) was observed in this alloy. The elongation had high

   carbides, having rough morphologies, were formed at the grain
   boundaries. Delta-phase formed due to gamma ''-phase dissolution in the
   gamma matrix, while MC-type carbides nucleates grew by diffusion of
   solute atoms. The presence of (Nb0.78Ti0.22) C carbide phase, with an
   fcc structure having a lattice parameter a = 4.43 angstrom, was revealed
   using Energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) and X-ray diffractometer
   (XRD) analysis. The solidification behavior of IN718 alloy was described
   to elucidate the evolution of different phases during selective laser
   melting and post-processing heat treatments of IN718.

AB Modern high pressure turbine blades and vanes of aero-engines are cooled
   and thermally protected using a thermal barrier coating (TBC) system.
   TBC systems are submitted to very complex service loadings, with a
   combination of mechanical and thermal fatigue under complex thermal
   gradients, in addition to the contribution of oxidation to the damage
   processes.
   The high temperature durability under combustion environment of the
   AM1/NiAIPt/EB-PVD TBC system used for high temperature blades and vanes
   has been investigated performing out of phase load controlled
   thermo-mechanical fatigue (TMF) and thermal-gradient-mechanical fatigue
   (TGMF) tests in the 500-1100 degrees C temperature range. This
   characterization has been performed using the MAATRE burner where
   massive or hollow samples can be mechanically loaded under hot gas flow
   conditions. This unique test rig allows for gas testing temperatures up
   to 1600 degrees C and internal cooling of hollow samples.
   The damage mechanisms under different TMF conditions are presented and
   the impact of a through thickness thermal gradient (induced by means of
   internal cooling) is analyzed. Moreover, a prior thermal over-aging of
   the whole system is investigated to mimic service degradation. It is
   shown in this work that depending on the tensile stress applied at low
   temperature, a change in the main degradation mechanism of the TBC
   system is observed. Moreover, the thermal over-aging before TMF tests
   favors cycling ratcheting in compression during thermo-mechanical
   cycling due to the degradation of the substrate microstructure. (C) 2016

   nickel-based superalloys MAR-M247 CC (HIP) and CM-247 LC is studied. The
   thermomechanical fatigue crack growth tests are performed under in-phase
   (IP) and out of-phase (OP) TMF loading between 300 degrees C and 950
   degrees C. It is shown, that the applied load ratio plays a crucial role
   for the resulting fatigue crack growth rates and whether IP or OP TMF
   loading is more detrimental. A digital optical microscope is installed,
   which allows in situ observation of the fatigue crack growth, the active
   damage mechanisms and the damage evolution even at high temperatures.
   The in situ observations are accompanied by fractographic
   investigations, which confirm, that IP TMF loading preferentially leads
   to interdentritic fracture. Finally, first steps towards a
   quantification of the active damage mechanisms are taken using digital
   image processing. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB A combination of experimental and analytical methods was used to study
   the possible occurrence of liquation during LFW of the newly developed
   AD730(TM) Ni-based superalloy. LFWed joints were produced using a
   semi-industrial size facility and the interfaces of the joints as well
   as the ejected flash were examined using optical and Field Emission Gun
   Scanning Electron Microscopy (FEG-SEM). Physical simulation of the LFW
   thermal cycle, using thermomechanical simulator Gleeble (TM) 3800,
   showed that incipient melting started from 1473 K (1200 A degrees C).
   The analytical model, calibrated by experiments, predicted that the
   highest temperature of the interface was about 1523 K (1250 A degrees
   C). The constitutive equations based on lattice and pipe diffusion
   models were developed to quantify the self-diffusivity of the elements
   and control the extent of liquation by considering the effect of LFW
   process parameters. Analytical results show that the application of
   compressive stresses during LFW results in 25 times increase in the
   diffusion of Ni atoms at the weld interface. Therefore, no presence of
   re-solidified phases, i.e., occurrence of liquation, was observed in the
   microstructure of the weld zone or the flash in the present study. Based
   on the obtained results, a methodology was developed for designing the
   optimum pressure above which no liquation, and hence cracking, will be
   observable. (C) The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society and ASM

   Rosenthal equation was used for calculation of mushy zone (MZ) and
   partially-melted zone (PMZ). Size of MZ and PMZ in GTAW are more than 31
   and 6 times than that of formed in pulsed Nd:YAG laser. According to the
   characterizations, solidification and Equation cracks were observed in
   these areas produced by GTAW whereas no cracks were identified in laser
   treated samples. Also, line scan EDS analyses demonstrated the
   interdendritic chromium and molybdenum segregation, which facilitated
   formation of hot cracks. With reduction in heat input per unit length,
   the hardness increased and the size of solidified metal microstructure
   reduced in pulse Nd:YAG laser. These comparative results showed that
   pulse Nd:YAG laser can easily be utilized as a new rejuvenation
   technique for aged Alloy 617 in comparison to the conventional processes
   due to extremely narrow MZ and HAZ and better surface soundness and
   mechanical properties.

AB Scanning laser epitaxy (SLE) is a laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) based
   additive manufacturing (AM) process developed for the repair and
   manufacture of gas turbine hot-section components made of nickelbase
   superalloys. In the present study, the single-pass fabrication of more
   than 1500 mm thick deposits of MAR-M247, a non-weldable superalloy atop
   similar chemistry substrates using a high-power laser beam is
   demonstrated. Metallurgical continuity is achieved across the entire
   deposit-substrate interface and the samples show little or no warpage
   across a broad range of processing parameters. In order to relieve the
   residual stresses and enable precipitation of the strengthening phases,
   the SLE-deposited MAR-M247 samples are subjected to a commercially
   available heat treatment process. Microstructures of the as-deposited
   and the heat-treated MAR-M247 samples are investigated using optical
   microscopy (OM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive
   X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Vickers
   microhardness measurements. The crack-free deposits obtained here for
   MAR-M247 represent one of the first few successes reported for a
   non-weldable alloy of its kind. The results demonstrate that the SLE
   process has significant potential for the AM-based repair of existing
   and fabrication of entirely new gas turbine hot-section components
   utilizing feedstocks of high gamma' content nickel-base superalloy
   powders. The results also establish that MAR-M247 is an attractive
   material for the LPBF-based AM processes. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All

   (Co-31.7%Ni-20.8%Cr-8.1%Al-0.5%Y, all in wt%) coatings prepared by high
   velocity oxy-fuel (HVOF) thermal spraying. The microstructure of the
   coatings was characterised using scanning electron microscopy with
   energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis and electron backscatter
   diffraction (EBSD). It comprises a two phase structure of fcc gamma-Ni
   matrix and bcc beta-NiAl precipitates. The volume fraction of the
   gamma-Ni and the beta-NiAl phases were measured to be around 70% and 30%
   respectively, with grain sizes varying largely from 0.5 to 2 mu m for
   both phases. Isothermal heat treatments of the freestanding coatings
   were carried out at 1100 degrees C for times up to 250 h. The beta-phase
   coarsening behaviour during isothermal heat treatments was analysed by
   quantitative metallography. It is shown that the coarsening behaviour of
   beta phase in the CoNiCrAlY alloy followed the classical
   Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner (LSW) theory of Ostwald ripening. By
   incorporating a dimensionless factor Which correlates with volume
   fraction of the beta phase, a modified LSW model coupled with formulaic
   interfacial energy and effective diffusion coefficient of the CoNiCrAlY
   alloy was utilised to interpret the coarsening behaviour of the beta
   phase. The coarsening rate coefficient obtained from the modified LSW
   model shows good agreement with the corresponding experimental result.

   The proportion of low Sigma coincidence site lattice (CSL) grain

AB Nb segregation and Laves phase formation are known to be detrimental to

   suppress Nb segregation and Laves phase formation are still lacking. In
   this work, a quasi-continuous-wave (QCW) laser additive manufacturing
   (LAM) is used to control Nb segregation and Laves phase formation.
   Thermal behaviors of the molten pool, microstructural evolution and
   mechanical response of the fabricated samples to aging treatment were
   investigated. Compared to continuous wave (CW) LAM, QCW-LAM results in a
   refined and equiaxed dendrite microstructure, a reduced Nb segregation,
   and attended fine and discrete Laves phase particles, due to an improved
   cooling rate with one order of magnitude and a decreased solidification
   time of the molten pool. In addition, the QCW sample shows a good
   response to aging treatment with a higher hardness and more desired
   tensile properties due to the reduced Nb segregation, the obtained fine
   discrete Laves phase and the refined dendrite microstructure. The
   tensile strength (similar to 1404.1 MPa), the yield strength (similar to
   1120.6 MPa) and the ductility (similar to 12.4 pct) of the aged QCW
   sample are higher than the ASTM limits of the wrought Inconel 718 alloy.

   offer the near-net shape fabrication of fully dense components with a
   high potential for geometrical optimisation, all of which contribute to
   subsequent reductions in material wastage and component weight. However,
   the influence of this manufacturing route on the properties of aerospace
   alloys must first be fully understood before being actively applied
   in-service. Specimens from the nickel superalloy C263 have been
   manufactured using Powder Bed Direct Laser Deposition (PB-DLD), each
   with unique post-processing conditions. These variables include two
   build orientations, vertical and horizontal, and two different heat
   treatments. The effects of build orientation and post-process heat
   treatments on the materials' mechanical properties have been assessed
   with the Small Punch Tensile (SPT) test technique, a practical test
   method given the limited availability of PB-DLD consolidated material.
   SPT testing was also conducted on a cast C263 variant to compare with
   PB-DLD derivatives. At both room and elevated temperature conditions,
   differences in mechanical performances arose between each material
   variant. This was found to be instigated by microstructural variations
   exposed through microscopic and Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy

   using the linear friction welding (LFW) process. In particular, the
   repair of a blade integrated disk (BLISK) through replacement of blades
   damaged in-service was emulated by LFW virgin IN 718 to in-service IN
   718. The virgin-in-service (V-IS) welds were then characterized to
   evaluate the evolution in the microstructural features, such as the
   grain size, delta phase, MC-type carbides and MN-type nitrides, across
   the weld region. In the as-welded condition, the weld and
   thermomechanically affected zones exhibited highly integral
   characteristics (i.e., no oxides, voids, or contamination), as well as
   no constitutional liquation of secondary phases (e.g., carbides and
   Laves phases). In the weld zone, grain refinement of the austenite
   (gamma) matrix was observed, using electron back scattered diffraction
   (EBSD), and related to the occurrence of dynamic recrystallization
   during LFW. The microhardness and tensile mechanical properties of the
   weldments were investigated in the as-welded condition and compared to
   weldments with a standard post-weld heat treatment (PWHT). The results
   suggest that the LFW process is a promising technology for refurbishing

AB In this study, the morphology and development of precipitate-free zones
   (PFZs) near grain boundaries (GBs) in low coefficient of thermal
   expansion (CTE) Ni-Mo-Cr-W alloys (based on Haynes 244) have been
   investigated as a function of thermal history and composition using
   electron microscopy techniques. It is shown that the formation of wide,
   continuous PFZs adjacent to GBs can be largely attributed to a vacancy
   depletion mechanism. It is proposed that variations in the vacancy
   distributions that develop after solution heat treatment (SHT) and
   subsequent quenching and aging greatly influence the development of the
   gamma'-Ni-2(Mo,Cr) precipitates during the aging process and result in
   the development of PFZs of varying sizes. The relatively large (5 to 10
   mu m) PFZs are distinct from the smaller, more common PFZs that result
   from solute depletion due to GB precipitation that are typically
   observed after prolonged aging. During the course of this investigation,
   heat treatment parameters, such as aging time, SHT temperature, cooling
   rate after SHT, and heating rate to the aging temperature-all of which
   change vacancy concentration and distribution adjacent to GBs-were
   investigated and observed to have significant influence on both the size
   and morphology of the observed PFZs. In contrast to results from other
   Ni-based alloys studied previously, PFZ development in the current
   alloys was observed across a broad range of aging temperatures. This
   appears to be due to the high misfit strain energy of the gamma'
   precipitates, resulting in a nucleation process that is sensitive to
   vacancy concentration. It is also shown that a slightly modified alloy
   with higher Mo concentrations develops smaller, more typical PFZs; this
   is presumably due to an increased driving force for gamma' precipitation
   which overshadows the influence of misfit strain energy, thereby
   decreasing the sensitivity of precipitation on vacancy concentration.

   Parametric study of the SLM process allows determination of a suitable

   XRD analysis of the as-manufactured samples reveals the presence of the
   fcc gamma-(Fe, Ni) phase only. The literature reports a considerable
   amount of gamma' phase in Ni/Fe-based superalloys processed by
   conventional metallurgy. The absence of the gamma' can be explained by
   extremely high cooling rates during SLM which prevents precipitation.
   Micrographic examination of the SLM-manufactured specimens shows a fully

AB We present a series of experimental observations on surface rumpling of
   an initially flat NiCoCrAIY coating deposited on a Ni-based superalloy
   during cyclic oxidation at 1150 degrees C. The extent of rumpling of the
   coating depends on the thermal history, coating thickness and exposed
   atmosphere. While the coating surface progressively roughens with cyclic
   oxidation, the bulk NiCoCrAIY alloys with the same nominal composition
   are much less susceptible to rumpling under the same oxidation
   conditions. The coatings, especially the thin ones, experience
   substantial degradation (e.g. beta to gamma phase transformation)
   induced by oxidation and coating/subsatrate interdiffusion. The
   observations together suggest that rumpling of the NiCoCrAIY coating is
   driven by a combination of the lateral growth of the thermally grown

AB Specimens of Selectively Laser Melted (SLM) CM247LC powder have been
   characterised using analytical scanning and transmission electron
   microscopy. In specimens from the bulk, it has been found that
   longitudinal sections consist mainly of columnar gamma grains,
   containing virtually identically oriented cells, approximately 700 nm in
   width and length up to hundreds of microns. These cells are separated
   from adjacent cells and from adjacent grains by gamma'/gamma eutectic,
   by high densities of Hf/Ti/Ta/W-rich precipitates and high densities of
   dislocations. The eutectic gamma' is up to about 50 nm in diameter but
   up to 10 nm within the cells. The microstructure in the top layer is
   similar to that taken from the bulk, but single-track samples are
   heterogeneous along the track length. The microstructures are
   interpreted in terms of the precipitation sequence, the volume fraction
   of eutectic and partitioning of the solute elements during
   solidification and the influence of subsequent laser-tracks. The cooling
   rate during solidification, calculated from the observed cell diameters
   is about 106 K/s, but the value obtained from the size of gamma' within
   the bulk is about 104 K/s. It is suggested that the discrepancy is due
   to the limited accuracy of this approach. Tensile tests on as-fabricated
   samples show that the yield strength is comparable with that of cast
   samples after standard heat treatments. The high strength of the
   as-fabricated samples is interpreted in terms the high densities of
   precipitates and dislocations in cell boundaries, the fine cell
   structure and the gamma' within cells. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier

AB Some research showed that the precipitation of eta-Ni3Al0.5Nb0.5 phase
   at grain boundary can optimize the mechanical properties and reduce the
   notch sensitivity of the nickel-based superalloy All 718Plus. Therefore,
   finding the optimum concentration and morphology of
   eta-Ni(3)Al(0.5)Nb(0.5)for different operating conditions is of great
   importance during the microstructure design process. In this study, the
   relationship between the mechanical properties as well as notch
   sensitivity and the eta-Ni3Al0.5Nb0.5 content in ATI 718Plus was
   investigated by subjecting the alloy to different heat treatment
   processes. The stress rupture life of All 718Plus was found to improve
   significantly by decreasing the eta-Ni3Al0.5Nb0.5 content. However, the
   notch sensitivity drastically increased when the eta-Ni3Al0.5Nb0.5 mass
   percentage dropped below approximately 1.1 wt%. The microstructure of
   the samples was analyzed by field emission scanning electron microscopy
   and the phase composition was quantitatively determined by electrolytic
   phase isolation followed by a micro-chemical and X-ray diffraction
   analysis. The atomic distribution of elements in the alloy on a
   nanoscale was determined by 3DAP technique. The phase diagram and time
   temperature -transformation curve of the different phase were calculated
   using the JMatPro6.0 software. Furthermore, the precipitation kinetics
   of the eta-Ni3Al0.5Nb0.5 and gamma' phases and the optimum
   eta-Ni3Al0.5Nb0.5 mass percentage in 718Plus were discussed. (C) 2017

PD APR 15 2017
PY 2017
AB Controlling grain size in polycrystalline nickel base superalloy is of
   paramount importance in optimizing hot-working process and achieving the
   desirable mechanical properties. Typically, a uniform and fine grain
   size is required throughout forging process to realize the superplastic
   deformation. Unfortunately, the forging processing window is very narrow
   and needs to be synergistically controlled by deformation temperature,
   strain rate, as well as strain amount, and the failure would lead to the
   non-uniform grain size, abnormal grain growth and even cracking. During
   superplastic deformation, dynamic recrystallization (DRX) is the
   governing mechanism to be adopted to maintain the required grain size.
   Previous literature have extensively documented the separated effect of
   deformation parameters using monotonic-pass compression test. Herein, we
   perform the multi-pass compression experiments to investigate the flow
   stress behavior and grain size evolution. By conducting multi-pass tests
   over a range of deformation parameters, it was demonstrated that the
   flow stress and grain size response differed from that in single-pass
   tests. The multi-pass compression tests unambiguously uncover the roles
   of DRX and static recrystallization (SRX) in regulating grain size and
   affecting flow stress. The experimental results further show, comparing
   to the monotonic-pass compression, the multi-pass approach can provide
   versatile routes to attain the desirable grain size distribution by
   means of utilizing DRX and SRX principles. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All

AB The microstructure and microhardness of Ni-base superalloy IN-738LC
   fabricated by laser solid forming (LSF) with the preheating was
   investigated. The results showed that with the increase of the
   preheating temperature (T-0) (25 degrees C, 800 degrees C, 900 degrees C
   and 1050 degrees C), the total crack length decreased significantly, the
   segregation of Ti and Al worsened, and the volume fraction of equiaxed
   grain increased, as well as the size of blocky carbides, gamma-gamma'
   eutectic and gamma' particles. The high-angle grain boundaries, at which
   the continuous liquid film can be easily formed, were found to be
   susceptible to cracking. Both the concentration of Ti and Al and the
   increase of dendrite spacing contribute to the growth of carbides and
   gamma-gamma' eutectic in the interdendrite while the size of the gamma'
   phases was largely affected by preheating. It was interesting to find
   that gamma' phase exhibited a bimodal distribution in the bottom of the
   deposit with the preheating at 1050 degrees C. The average microhardness
   of the deposits without preheating and with preheating at 800 degrees C
   and 900 degrees C is about at the same level, while the deposit with
   preheating at 1050 degrees C has the lowest average value. The
   crack-free deposit can be obtained when T-0 was up to 1050 degrees C,
   and its room temperature tensile properties are superior to cast

AB A 2D cellular automaton model (CA) is developed to predict the hot
   deformation behavior of a Ni-based superalloy over a wide range of
   thermal-mechanical conditions. Relationships between the model
   parameters (work hardening parameter, dynamic recovery parameter,
   nucleation rate, and grain boundary mobility) and the thermal-mechanical
   conditions are established. The developed CA model is further employed
   to study the hot deformation behavior of the studied superalloy under
   varying thermal-mechanical conditions. These varying conditions include
   the sudden change of strain rate and gradual change of deformation
   temperature. The evolutions of flow stress, average grain size and
   fraction of dynamic recrystallization (DRX) under the varying
   thermal-mechanical conditions are predicted. The reliability of the
   simulated results is verified by experimental results. It is found that
   the predicted results under varying thermal-mechanical conditions
   gradually approach those under constant hot deformed conditions. i.e.,
   constant deformation temperature and strain rate. The varying
   thermal-mechanical condition makes the complex evolution of dislocation
   density, fraction of DRX, and average grain size. Additionally, a
   pseudo-metadynamic recrystallization is found. The pseudo-metadynamic
   recrystallization is a temporary suspension of dynamic recrystallization
   during a large and rapid increase of strain rate as a consequence of
   nucleation inhibition. It resembles metadynamic recrystallization,
   except that the pseudo-metadynamic recrystallization occurs when the hot
   deformation is still underway.

AB Low cycle fatigue (LCF) performance of IN718 superalloy under different
   heat treatment conditions are investigated with controlled strain
   amplitudes from 0.6% to 1.0% at 350 degrees C and 650 degrees C.
   Standard heat treatment (ST) and delta-phase aging treatment (DA) are
   applied to produce two types of precipitation microstructures. Under the
   same strain amplitude and temperature, the fatigue lives of ST specimens
   exceed that of DA specimens. And strikingly, ST specimens exhibit cyclic
   softening behavior in contrast to cyclic hardening behavior for DA
   specimens. The different stress responses can be rationalized by the
   dislocation interaction mechanisms with the precipitates. For the ST
   specimens, the dislocation shearing of gamma '' precipitates governs the
   microscopic deformation process, while the micrometer-sized 8 phases are
   not shearable but act as the obstacles against dislocation slipping and
   lead to the cyclic hardening. Our TEM observations clearly show that
   recrystallization nucleation is prevalent in the DA specimens under 650
   degrees C, which is interpreted by the high dislocation density induced
   by the 6 phases. The results shed new lights on the fatigue microscopic
   deformation mechanisms of IN718 superalloy.

AB Serrated flow behavior of CoCrFeNiMn high entropy alloy with a single
   face-centered cubic phase was systematically examined over a wide range
   of temperature and strain rate. The alloy exhibited excellent fracture
   resistance with RT elongation up to 56%. Prominent serrations occurred
   at the medium temperature range and evolved in the sequence of A -> A+B
   -> B -> B -> C -> C with increasing temperature and decreasing strain
   rate. The initial small plasticity produced low density of dislocations
   piled up at grain boundaries and high density of dislocations were
   tangled to form cell substructures during subsequent severe deformation
   stage. Bowing and kinks of dislocations were frequently observed at 400
   and 600 degrees C. The critical strain for the onset of serrated flow
   decreased with increasing temperature and decreasing strain rate,
   indicating a normal and not inverse Portevin Le Chatelier (PLC) effect
   due to the thermodynamic stability of the alloy. Two
   temperature-dependent values of activation energy for serrated flow (Q)
   were obtained. The estimated low value (116 kJ mol(-1)) implied that
   pipe diffusion is responsible for the pinning process of dislocations
   from 300 to 500 degrees C. In contrast, a higher Q (295 kJ mol(-1))
   between 500 and 600 degrees C suggested that the pinning or unpinning
   process of dislocations is controlled by the most sluggish diffusion
   species (i.e. Ni) in the high-entropy alloy.

   parameters investigated, the corresponding deformation mechanism map
   revealed that dynamic recrystallization or dynamic recovery was

   through electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) method. The results
   showed that the hot-rolled microstructure is mainly composed of
   elongated grains with typical texture components of B, Cu and S at the
   mid-layer of plates, while substantial inhomogeneous fine grains can be
   observed between the deformation grains at the surface-layer showing a
   combination of R-C and R-Cu components. Following solution treatment,
   the original deformed grains are fully substituted by the fine
   recrystallized grains and the grain size increases significantly at
   higher solution temperatures. An alternant lamellar structure of fine
   and coarse grains forms along the rolling direction at 1050 degrees C
   due to the pinning effect of TiC at fine grains boundaries. Besides, C
   and G are the dominant texture components after solution treatment. With
   increasing solution temperature, the overall level of LM and
   micro-hardness decrease stably and a higher ratio of Sigma 3:Sigma(9+27)
   indicates that Sigma 3(n) boundaries proliferation mechanism transforms

AB The effect of homogenization heat treatment on cast structure, hardness,
   and tensile properties of the nickel based superalloy 718plus in the
   presence of boron and zirconium additives were investigated. For this
   purpose, five alloys with different contents of boron (0.00-0.016 wt%)
   and zirconium (0.0-0.1 wt%) were cast by double vacuum process VIM/VAR
   and then were homogenized at 1075-1175 degrees C for 5-25 h.
   1Vlicrostructural investigation by OM and SEM and phase analysis by XRD
   were done and then hardness and high temperature tensile tests were
   performed on the homogenized alloys. The results show that the amount of
   the Laves phase is reduced by increases in time and temperature of
   homogenization. It was also found that increases in duration of
   homogenization at 1075 degrees C results in improving strength and
   ductility, while duration increase at 1175 degrees C is accompanied with
   degradation of them, which caused the reduction of needle-like delta
   phase on grain boundaries. Boron and zirconium had negative effects on
   the strength and ductility of the alloy by increasing the amount of
   Laves in the cast structure. By increasing these elements in alloy
   composition, more time is needed in order to fully eliminate the Laves
   by homogenization treatment.

AB The rapid microstructural evolution of gas atomised Ni superalloy powder
   compacts over timescales of a few seconds was studied using a Gleeble
   3500 thermomechanical simulator, finite element based numerical model
   and electron microscopy. The study found that the microstructural
   changes were governed by the characteristic temperatures of the alloy.
   At a temperature below the gamma' solvus, the powders maintained
   dendritic structures. Above the gamma' solvus temperature but in the
   solid-state, rapid grain spheroidisation and coarsening occurred,
   although the fine-scale microstructures were largely retained. Once the
   incipient melting temperature of the alloy was exceeded, microstructural
   change was rapid, and when the temperature was increased into the solid
   + liquid state, the powder compact partially melted and then
   re-solidified with no trace of the original structures, despite the fast
   timescales. The study reveals the relationship between short, severe
   thermal excursions and microstructural evolution in powder processed
   components, and gives guidance on the upper limit of temperature and
   time for powder-based processes if desirable fine-scale features of
   powders are to be preserved. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Paper presents the results of ATD and DSC analysis of two superalloys
   used in casting of aircraft engine parts. The main aim of the research
   was to obtain the solidification parameters, especially Tsol and Tliq,
   knowledge of which is important for proper selection of casting and heat
   treatment parameters. Assessment of the metallurgical quality (presence
   of impurities) of the feed ingots is also a very important step in
   production of castings. It was found that some of the feed ingots
   delivered by the superalloy producers are contaminated by oxides located
   in shrinkage defects. The ATD analysis allows for quite precise
   interpretation of first stages of solidification at which solid phases
   with low values of latent heat of solidification are formed from the
   liquid. Using DSC analysis it is possible to measure precisely the heat
   values accompanying the phase changes during cooling and heating which,
   with knowledge of phase composition, permits to calculate the enthalpy
   of formation of specific phases like gamma or gamma'

AB Hot compression tests of double-cone samples were conducted for 690
   alloy to study the kinetic behavior of the complete dynamic
   recrystallization (DRX) process under low deformation temperatures from
   960 to 1080 A degrees C. The microstructure of 82 points in the vertical
   section of every deformed sample was quantitatively analyzed to
   determine the DRX fraction. Corresponding strain of these points was
   calculated by finite element simulations. Kinetic curves of the
   specimens with different preheating temperatures were then constructed.
   The features of various boundaries with different misorientation angles
   were investigated by electron backscatter diffraction technology and
   transmission electron microscope. The results showed that the strain is
   continuously and symmetrically distributed along the centerline of the
   vertical section. Large strain of 1.84 was obtained when the compression
   amount is 12 mm for double-cone samples. All the fitted kinetic curves
   display an "S" type, which possess a low growth rate of DRX at the
   beginning and the end of compression. The critical strain of
   recrystallization decreases with the increase in preheating temperature,
   while the completion strain remains around 1.5 for all the samples. The
   initial and maximum growth rates of DRX fraction have the opposite trend
   with the change in temperature, which is considered to be attributed to
   the behaviors of different misorientation boundaries.

PY 2017
AB The estimation of crack growth (CG) in conventionally cast nickel-based
   superalloys is of particular interest, since their low ductility and
   large grain size makes them prone to quasi-brittle fracture. Components
   made from this material class are often subjected to complex
   thermo-mechanic fatigue (TMF) loads. CG testing under TMF loads is
   expensive and not yet standardized. In addition, many damage mechanisms
   contribute to the crack growth process under TMF conditions.
   Nevertheless the need for validated crack growth estimations increases
   with the demand for flexible load cases.
   In this work, isothermal and TMF fatigue CG test data of the
   nickel-based cast alloy C1023 are described by a linear-accumulative
   CG-model. In this model, fatigue crack growth is treated as temperature
   independent. Additionally, two temperature-dependent CG-contributions
   from creep crack growth and through oxidation damage are considered.
   gamma'-depletion caused by surface oxidation was found to play a
   dominant role. By dissecting given load cycles into time steps, a
   revised calculation procedure was implemented to realize estimations for
   isothermal and thermo-mechanical crack growth, independent from the
   cyclic time-temperature evolution.
   The procedure is validated against a variety of CG-experiments,
   including various TMF-tests with and without hold times. It is also
   possible to assess the crack evolution and the dominant driver of crack
   propagation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   Differential scanning calorimetry was conducted with a thermal cycle
   that replicated a processing heat treatment. The hardness of these
   alloys was subsequently evaluated by nanoindentation. The Nb/Ti ratio
   was not observed to influence the size and distribution of primary and
   secondary gamma' precipitates; however, the difference in those of
   tertiary gamma' and precipitate morphology were observed. The
   nanoindentation hardness for all alloys reduces once they have been
   solution-heat-treated. The alloys exhibited specific peak hardness. The
   alloy with the greatest Nb content was found to have the best increase
   in hardness among the alloys studied due to its large tertiary gamma'

AB The mechanical properties of Ni-base alloys have drawn considerable
   attention owing to their wide application in the hot components of
   aircrafts and gas turbines. To accurately measure the deformation of
   Ni-based alloys at high temperatures, a new type of high-temperature
   speckles is fabricated on the surface of specimens subjected to long
   heating durations at temperatures up to 1400 A degrees C. Meanwhile, a
   novel measurement method based on the scale-invariant feature transform
   algorithm is developed to measure the deformation and obtain a more
   accurate result. Both of the above proposed methods are used in a creep
   test of Inconel 713C at 860 A degrees C. The experimental results
   indicate that the speckles exhibit excellent performance under heating
   conditions and adhere well to the substrate at high temperatures. Also,
   the proposed deformation measurement method exhibits superior image
   processing even when the speckle quality is imperfect with respect to
   speckle size.

   systemat-ically investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
   and nanoindentation. And the thermal stability of surface
   nanocrystalline layer was studied by in-situ TEM annealing with
   different temperatures and duration times (500 degrees C/1 h, 700
   degrees C/1 h and 900 degrees C/3 h). In addition, we designed a kind of
   nanoindentation test with the sample being post annealed at 900 degrees
   C for 10 h to verify the thermal stability of nanocrystalline layer. The
   re-sults indicated that nanostructure has superior thermal stability
   after annealing at 700 degrees C for 1 h, which is higher than the
   dynamic crystallization temperature, 0.36 T-m (melting temperature T-m
   is about 1300 degrees C). Grain growth occurred at 900 degrees C, but
   some nano-grains with the size of around 50 nm still existed, and the
   nanohardness test further strengthened the evidence of good thermal
   stability. All these experimental results indicated that such Ni-based
   superalloy with nanocrystalline layer exhibited relatively good thermal
   stability after annealing at 900 degrees C. Lastly, the mechanism of
   thermal stability of surface nanostructure produced by LSP in a Ni-based

   due to the good wettability and affinity of the brazing filler with two
   kinds of raw materials. SiC coating has a medium coefficient of thermal
   expansion (CTE) between C/C composites and superalloy, which could
   relieve the CTE mismatch between C/C and GH3044. Moreover, the joint is
   significantly strengthened and toughened by SiC nanowires. The shearing

   degrees C at a strain rate of 0.035/min. Intergranular fracture and
   intermediate temperature brittleness (ITB) took place at around 750
   degrees C. The microstructure and the fracture surface morphology
   observation by optical microscopy, scanning and transmission electron
   microscopy showed that the ITB to a large extent depended on the grain
   boundary sliding (GBS) and the gamma prime (gamma') precipitation during
   the elevated temperature tensile deformation. X-ray diffraction (XRD)
   confirmed that the primary phases formed during the last stage of
   solidification were mainly TiN nitrides, MC carbides, and Laves phases
   in the form of Laves/gamma eutectics. Quantitative statistics of the
   Laves/gamma eutectics and the MX(MC, TiN) phases were processed. These
   primary phases had a pinning effect on the migration of grain boundaries
   and accordingly made the grain boundaries tortuous. The tortuous grain
   boundaries were expected to inhibit the GBS, relieving ITB. Transmission
   electron microscopy confirmed that fine Laves particles precipitated
   along the grain boundary in the weld metal with higher Mo content during
   the deformation process, and these Laves particles were also supposed to
   be one factor for inhibiting the GBS.

   were studied in both as-deposited and heat treated condition. In the as
   deposited condition, hardness heterogeneity was observed along the
   build. The upper section had higher hardness than the lower section.
   From SEM and EDS observation, this high hardness was attributed to the
   continuous eutectics (mainly Laves phase with few NbC) at the
   inter-dendritic regions. These eutectics in the lower section that were
   partially re-melted during the multi-pass process had formed
   non-continuous features contributing to a lower hardness. Moreover, fine
   isolated M5B3 borides that confirmed by TEM with SAD patterns
   precipitated out from they matrix in lower section as a result of the
   multiple thermal cycles. The Laves phases were totally re-melted during
   heat treatment, resulting in the formation of large size M5B3 borides
   from SEM and TEM analysis during heat treatment solidification. This led
   to elimination of hardness heterogeneity by homogenizing microstructure
   along the build after annealing and aging treatment. This microstructure
   evolution also eradicated the risk of strain-age cracks during heat
   treatment. A large amount of zigzag grain boundaries were formed
   attributed to the pinning effect of M5B3 and NbC. The tensile properties
   of heat treated IN625B deposits were tested at both ambient and elevated
   temperature. The results indicated that the ultimate tensile strength
   and yield strength of gas tungsten arc IN625B deposits were superior to
   the conventional IN625 in the solution annealed condition.

AB The formation mechanism of white layers during broaching and their
   mechanical properties are not well investigated and understood to date.
   In the present study, multiple advanced characterization techniques with
   nano-scale resolution, including transmission electron microscopy (TEM),
   transmission Kikuchi diffraction (TKD), atom probe tomography (APT) as
   well as nano-indentation, have been used to systematically examine the
   microstructural evolution and corresponding mechanical properties of a
   surface white layer formed when broaching the nickel-based superalloy
   Inconel 718.
   TEM observations showed that the broached white layer consists of
   nano-sized grains, mostly in the range of 20-50 nm. The crystallographic
   texture detected by TKD further revealed that the refined microstructure
   is primarily caused by strong shear deformation. Co-located Al-rich and
   Nb-rich fine clusters have been identified by APT, which are most likely
   to be gamma' and gamma '' clusters in a form of co-precipitates, where
   the clusters showed elongated and aligned appearance associated with the
   severe shearing history. The microstructural characteristics and
   crystallography of the broached white layer suggest that it was
   essentially formed by adiabatic shear localization in which the dominant
   metallurgical process is rotational dynamic recrystallization based on
   mechanically-driven subgrain rotations. The grain refinement within the
   white layer led to an increase of the surface nano-hardness by 14% and a
   reduction in elastic modulus by nearly 10% compared to that of the bulk
   material. This is primarily due to the greatly increased volume fraction
   of grain boundaries, when the grain size was reduced down to the
   nanoscale.

AB The interdiffusion behaviour of a 5 mu m thick layer of Pt deposited by
   electroplating on a gamma-Ni-12Al-10Cr model alloy was studied in order
   to assess the effect of Cr. Heat treatments were performed for 1 min up
   to 1 h at 1100 degrees C under argon. Cr addition increased the uphill
   diffusion of Al to the surface when compared with Pt/gamma-(Ni,Al)
   systems. Al and Cr had a positive chemical interaction in presence of
   Pt, as shown by the positive values of the D-AlCr(Ni) and D-AlCr(Ni)
   diffusion coefficients determined by modelling. Pt had a negative
   chemical interaction with Al and with Cr in such a way that Pt decreased
   their activities. According to the diffusion coefficient values, Pt had
   a greater influence on the Al activity than on the Cr one. Similarly, 2
   mu m of Pt and 3 mu m of Pt-25Ir were deposited by electroplating on the
   same model alloy to investigate the effect of Ir. Heat treatments were
   performed in the same conditions as for Cr. Iridium slowed down the
   interdiffusion when compared with systems with Pt only. Iridium diffused
   slower toward the substrate than Pt and a lower Pt + Ir flux toward the
   substrate was found. As voids formed at the interdiffusion
   zone/substrate interface due to Kirkendall effect, this lower inward Pt
   + Ir flux resulted in a lower outward vacancy flux and then Ir reduced
   Kirkendall voids formation. Moreover, Ir decreased the Pt effect on Al
   activity by dilution or even gave an opposite contribution to the Pt
   one. This reduced the uphill diffusion of Al, delaying the alpha-NiPtAl
   phase formation. Diffusion paths of each model system were also
   identified after 15 min at 1100 degrees C and all highlighted the
   alpha-NiPtAl phase formation and its aptitude to be used in TBC systems.

AB The electron beam melting (EBM) process was used to fabricate Inconel
   718. The microstructure and tensile properties were characterized in
   both the as-fabricated and post-processed state transverse
   (T-orientation) and longitudinal (L-orientation) to the build direction.
   Post-processing involved both a hot isostatic pressing (HIP) and
   solution treatment and aging (STA) to homogenize the microstructure. In
   the as-fabricated state, EBM Inconel 718 exhibits a spatially dependent
   microstructure that is a function of build height. Spanning the last few
   layers is a cored dendritic structure comprised of the products
   (carbides and Laves phase) predicted under equilibrium solidification
   conditions. With increasing distance from the build's top surface, the
   cored dendritic structure becomes increasingly homogeneous with complete
   dissolution of the secondary dendrite arms. Further, temporal phase
   kinetics are observed to lead to the dissolution of the strengthening
   gamma '' and precipitation of networks of fine delta needles that span
   the grains. Microstructurally, post-processing resulted in dissolution
   of the delta networks and homogeneous precipitation of gamma ''
   throughout the height of the build. In the as-fabricated state, the
   monotonic tensile behavior exhibits a height sensitivity within the
   T-orientation at both 20 and 650 degrees C. Along the L-orientation, the
   tensile behavior exhibits strength values comparable to the reference
   wrought material in the fully heat-treated state. After post-processing,
   the yield strength, ultimate strength, and elongation at failure for the
   EBM Inconel 718 were observed to have beneficially increased compared to
   the as fabricated material. Further, as a result of post-processing the
   spatial variance of the ultimate yield strength and elongation at
   failure within the transverse direction decreased by 4 and 3x
   respectively.

AB To emulate combined welding and brazing techniques, frequently used
   during the rejuvenation of turbine components, TIG and SWET weld
   overlays have been applied to the surfaces of a single crystal
   nickel-based alloy and subsequently overlain with braze and subjected to
   a typical brazing cycle heat treatment. Both welds comprised of columnar
   dendritic microstructures with an epitaxial [001] growth orientation
   near the substrate surface and equiaxed randomly oriented grains at the
   weld surface. While the TIG weld showed a sharp columnar to equiaxed
   transition, that for the SWET weld was diffuse and comprised colonies of
   columnar structures with their [001] misoriented to the epitaxial
   columnar directions as a result of shallower temperature gradients.
   Analysis of the microstructures of the brazed materials showed that the
   extents of boron penetration were significantly greater for the welds
   due to enhanced diffusion along grain boundaries between the equiaxed
   structures compared to gamma channel limited transport in the single
   crystal. A striking feature of the diffusion zone microstructures was
   the development of carbo-boride needles which formed by the reaction of
   boron, refractory metals and TaC. It is the release of Ta from TaC which
   stabilises gamma' envelope formation around the needles. The post brazed
   microstructures of TIG welds used in this study showed considerably
   fewer detrimental boride precipitates than brazed SWET welds and as a
   result are expected to show superior mechanical properties. (C) 2016

AB Grain boundary engineering (GBE) of nickel-based alloy 825 tubes was
   carried out with different cold drawing deformations by using a
   draw-bench on a factory production line and subsequent annealing at
   various temperatures. The microstructure evolution of alloy 825 during
   thermal-mechanical processing (TMP) was characterized by means of the
   electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) technique to study the TMP
   effects on the grain boundary network and the evolution of grain
   boundary character distributions during high temperature annealing. The
   results showed that the proportion of Sigma 3(n) coincidence site
   lattice (CSL) boundaries of alloy 825 tubes could be increased to >75%
   by the TMP of 5% cold drawing and subsequent annealing at 1050 degrees C
   for 10 min. The microstructures of the partially recrystallized samples
   and the fully recrystallized samples suggested that the proportion of
   low Sigma CSL grain boundaries depended on the annealing time. The
   frequency of low Sigma CSL grain boundaries increases rapidly with
   increasing annealing time associating with the formation of large-size
   highly-twinned grains-cluster microstructure during recrystallization.
   However, upon further increasing annealing time, the frequency of low
   Sigma CSL grain boundaries decreased markedly during grain growth. So it
   is concluded that grain boundary engineering is achieved through
   recrystallization rather than grain growth. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All

AB The growth of MoSi2 films by the electrochemical siliciding of Mo was
   investigated and MoSi2 film formation was attempted on a Ni-based
   superalloy (CMSX-4) via a two-step coating process. An oxidation test of
   the MoSi2 film was also performed. A thick MoSi2 film was obtained at a
   temperature below 1073 K. At a relatively high current density of 100
   mA.cm(-2), the supply of Si to the Mo surface was too fast and pure Si
   was deposited outward instead of alloying. The growth rate of MoSi2 at
   50 mA.cm(-2) was 57 mu m.h(-1), abnormally fast compared to that by
   normal diffusion. This indicated that Si diffused through the grain
   boundaries, rather than through grain bodies. A dense and homogeneous
   MoSi2 film, approximately 100 mu m thick, was successfully formed on
   CMSX-4. The boundaries in MoSi2/Mo and Mo/CMSX-4 were coherent. After
   oxidation testing, a multilayer comprising SiO2, MoSi2, Mo5Si3, Mo, an
   intermediate layer, and CMSX-4 was formed. The SiO2 film was
   significantly thick at 10-30 mu m compared to literature values. To
   obtain a thin SiO2 film, a MoSi2 layer with fewer defects might be
   required. (c) 2017 The Electrochemical Society. All rights reserved.

   Results demonstrate that the measured hardness (478 +/- 7 HV) of the
   material processed using in situ heat treatment similar to that of
   peak-aged Inconel 718. Large solidification grains and cracks formed,
   which are identified as the likely mechanism leading to failure of

   Despite poor tensile performance, the technique proposed was shown to
   successively age Alloy 718 (increase precipitate size and hardness)
   without removing the sample from the process chamber, which can reduce
   the number of process steps in producing a part. Tighter controls on

AB A new micro-composite refractory enamel (MCRE) was designed to play a
   multifunctional protective role (thermal barrier coating, corrosive and
   erosive protection) for the hot working parts made of EI868 superalloy
   sheets i.e. burning chambers, fire tubes, volets, eclises, etc. The
   effect of the isothermal heating at elevates temperature (800 degrees C,
   900 degrees C) were, for the first time, investigate for MCRE/EI868
   couple. The adhesion strength has shown an enhancement of about 100%
   when the couple was heated at 800 degrees C or at 900 degrees C for 10 h
   compared with the unexposed one. SEM-EDS, OM, XRD, EDP-XRFS and SDAR-OES
   investigations support a chemical bonding mechanism between MCRE and
   EI868 substrate via a transient interface layer. Elemental EDS
   distributions show that the Cr selective oxidation is responsible for
   the formation of the transient layer. The XRD measurements can be
   correlated with the contribution of the spinellic transformation of the
   SiO2, Cr2O3, NiO to the adhesion enhancement. The most important result
   reported herein is the adhesion strength enhancement of the MCRE
   coatings to the EI868 supperalloy by isothermal treatment. Accordingly,
   the MCRE behaves as a self-healing coating. Noteworthy, the working
   lifetime of the MCRE-EI868 couple can be significantly enhanced if an
   optimum pre-treatment is applied before it comes into service.

AB Purpose - Laser additive manufacturing (LAM) technology based on powder
   bed has been used to manufacture complex geometrical components. In this
   study, IN625 superalloys were fabricated by high-power fiber laser
   without cracks, bounding errors or porosity. Meanwhile, the objectives
   of this paper are to systemically investigate the microstructures,
   micro-hardness and the precipitated Laves phase of deposited-IN625 under
   different annealing temperatures.
   Design/methodology/approach - The effects of annealing temperatures on
   the microstructure, micro-hardness and the precipitated Laves phase were
   studied by optical microscope (OM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM),
   X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS), selected
   area electron diffraction (SAED), backscattered electron (BSE) imaging
   in the SEM and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), respectively. The
   thermal stability of the dendritic morphology about IN625 superalloys
   was investigated through annealing at temperatures range from 1,000
   degrees C to 1,000 degrees C.
   Findings - It is found that the microstructure of deposited-IN625 was
   typical dendrite structure. Besides, some Laves phase precipitated in
   the interdendritic region results in the segregation of niobium and
   molybdenum. The thermal stability indicate that the morphology of
   dendrite can be stable up to 1,000 degrees C. With the annealing
   temperatures increasing from 1,000 to 1,200 degrees C, the Laves phase
   partially dissolves into the gamma-Ni matrix, and the morphology of the
   remaining Laves phase is changing from irregular shape to rod-like or
   block-like shape.
   Research limitations/implications - The heat treatment used on the IN625
   superalloys is helpful for knowing the evolution of microstructures and
   precipitated phases thermal stability and mechanical properties.
   Practical implications - Due to the different kinds of application
   conditions, the original microstructure of the IN625 superalloys
   fabricated by LAM may not be ideal. So exploring the influence of
   annealing treatment on IN625 superalloys can bring theory basis and
   guidance for actual production.
   Originality/value - This study continues valuing the fabrication of
   IN625 by LAM. It shows the effect of annealing temperatures on the
   shape, size and distribution of Laves phase and the microstructures of
   deposited-IN625 superalloys.

AB The main scope of this work is to describe the microstructure evolution
   of single-crystal (SX) superalloy Rene N4 during creep and static aging
   at high temperatures, in function of time, stress and temperature.
   During creep at high temperatures, SX microstructure evolves from a
   dense and ordered distribution of cuboidal gamma' particles to a
   configuration characterized by alternate rafts of gamma' phase and gamma
   matrix, through a process known as rafting. The microstructural
   evolution of superalloys is very important to derive models able to
   predict service conditions of a component through microstructural
   analysis. In this work two microstructural parameters were identified
   and analyzed for Rene N4: matrix channels width w along the [001]
   lattice direction and periodicity width lambda, given by the sum of w
   and the width of the gamma' precipitates along [001]. Both parameters
   were measured on some creep-damaged and some statically aged specimens,
   as well as on the virgin material to analyze their trends in function of
   time, temperature and stress. In particular, the parameter Delta lambda
   looks independent of both the stress level and the microstructural
   morphology and could be used in future works to develop microstructural
   evolution model of Rene N4 in function of service time and temperature.

   colonies are reduced with the MHT temperature further increased to 1450

   the variation of melt structure which was induced by increasing of MHT
   temperature. And the exothermic curves were recorded by the DTA
   instrument to identify the solidification process of the melt with
   different melt structure. The morphology of dendrite arms, the

AB Purpose -The Ni-based superalloy IN-738 LC is known to be susceptible to
   porosity and different types of cracking during the build-up process
   and, thus, challenging to manufacture using selective laser melting (
   SLM). Determining a feasible set of operating parameters for SLM of
   nickel-based superalloys involves new approach to experimental design
   based on the Doehlert method that assists in determining an optimal (
   feasible) set of operating parameters for SLM of IN-738 LC powder alloy.
   Design/methodology/approach - The SLM parameters are evaluated in terms
   of their effectiveness in obtaining the microstructure with a porosity
   content of <0.5 per cent and without micro-cracking. The experimental
   approach is exemplified with the Doehlert matrix response variable,
   relative density, by comparing Archimedes method with microstructural
   assessments of pores and cracks from image analysis. The effect of heat
   treatment ( HT) and hot isostatic pressing ( HIP) on the microstructure
   of the SLMed IN-738 LC powder alloy has been examined and the
   consequential tensile response characterised.
   Findings - By using optimised process parameters ( low heat input,

AB Hot deformation behavior of a corrosion-resistant nickel-based alloy was
   studied in temperature range of 1050-1200 A degrees C and strain rate
   range of 0.001-10 s(-1) by employing hot compression tests. An approach
   of processing map was used to reveal the hot workability and
   microstructural evolution during the hot deformation. The results show
   that different stable domains in the processing map associated with the
   microstructure evolution can be ascribed to different dynamic
   recrystallization (DRX) mechanisms. The discontinuous dynamic
   recrystallization (DDRX) grains evolved by the necklace mechanism are
   finer than those evolved by the ordinary mechanism, respectively,
   arising from the strong nucleation process and the growth process. If
   subjected to low temperature and high strain rate, the flow instability
   domain occurs, due to the continuous dynamic recrystallization (CDRX)
   based on the evolution of deformation micro-bands within the deformed
   grains. Based on the processing map, a DRX mechanism map is established,
   which can provide an idea for designing desired microstructure.

   grain refinement process was summarised as deformation twinning,
   dislocation-twin reaction, localied thinning of nanotwin lamellae and
   final fracture. The underlying dislocation-twin interaction mechanism
   was elucidated from the crystallographic perspective. Using electron
   backscatter diffraction and precession electron diffraction techniques,
   a multiscale texture analysis covering undeformed coarse grain region,
   ultrafine grain region and nanograin region was carried out. The texture
   evolution with decreasing depth to the machined surface was identified

   at high temperature representative of service conditions. It was also

AB In this work, interdiffusion between a polycrystalline nickel-base
   superalloy (Rene 80) and two MCrAlY bond coats, each with a different
   chemical composition, is investigated. Of primary interest is the
   evolution of Kirkendall porosity, which can form at the interface of
   substrate and bond coat and depends largely on the chemical composition
   of the coating and substrate, as well as on the coating deposition
   process. Severe formation of porosity at the interface causes a
   degradation of the bonding strength between substrate and coating, with
   functional breakdown of the coating system as worst result. To
   investigate the influence of the deposition process, the MCrAlY bond
   coats were applied using two different spraying processes, high velocity
   oxygen fuel spraying (HVOF) and low-pressure plasma spraying (LPPS).
   After coating deposition, the samples were annealed at 1050 degrees C
   for varying test periods up to 2000 h. Microstructural and compositional
   analyses were performed to determine and to evaluate the Kirkendall
   porosity. The results reveal a strong influence of both the spraying
   process and the chemical composition. Bond coats applied by means of
   LPPS show less Kirkendall porosity than bond coats applied by HVOF.
   Furthermore, the location of Kirkendall porosity formation shifts,
   depending on the spraying process used, from the substrate-side of the
   interface (LPPS) to the coating-side of the interface (HVOF). It is
   hypothesized that accelerated element diffusion, especially of aluminum,
   from coating to substrate is the main factor for these observations.
   Results indicate that matching the chromium activity in coating and
   substrate will result in lower amounts of Kirkendall porosity because of
   chromium accumulation at the interface. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

   Ni-based single crystal superalloy during directional solidification,
   aiming to investigate the influence of melt thermal history (melt
   superheating temperature, superheating time and cooling rate) on
   solidification behavior and microstructural characteristics. The results
   show that the nucleation undercooling increases nonlinearly with the
   increase of melt superheating temperature from 1450 to 1780 degrees C,
   but decreases when the melt superheating temperature further increases
   up to 1800 degrees C. The nucleation undercooling first has little
   change and then increases sharply with increasing the melt superheating
   time. The critical superheating time is obtained to be about 15 min.
   Moreover, it is found that the higher the cooling rate is, the larger
   the nucleation undercooling and liquidus-solidus range are.
   Additionally, the segregation is reduced, and the dendrite and gamma'
   phase are obviously refined when the superheating temperature increases
   from 1500 to 1700 degrees C. The influence mechanism of melt
   superheating treatment on the nucleation undercooling and solidification

AB The microstructural evolution of an aged Ni-based superalloy under
   two-stage hot compressive deformation with different strain rates is
   investigated. In terms of strain rate, the hot compressive tests include
   two types: constant and stepped strain rates. For the first type, the
   strain rate remains constant during thewhole hot compression, while for
   the second type, the hot compression process consists of two stages: I
   and II. Moreover, the strain rate of stage I (0.01, 0.1, and 1 s(-1)) is
   larger than that of stage II (0.001 s(-1)). It is found that the strain
   rate and strain of stage I greatly affect the microstructural evolution
   for the hot compressive deformation with stepped strain rates. In the
   tested strain rate and strain, both the dissolution rate of delta phase
   and the dynamic recrystallization (DRX) volume fraction increase with
   the decrease of strain rate or the increase of strain in stage I.
   Compared with the constant strain rate hot deformation, the stepped
   strain rates can obviously promote DRX behaviors and the dissolution of
   d phase if the appropriate strain rate and strain of stage I are chosen.
   These findings can be directly applied in the practical industrial
   production of superalloy components. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   Vacuum melted argon atomized 625 superalloy powder was used to fabricate

   properties. Elemental analysis, phase formation and microstructure of
   the sintered, solution treated and aged samples were investigated by
   using optical, scanning/transmission electron microscopy with electron
   dispersive spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction. The results indicate
   that the aging treatment resulted in the formation of intermetallic
   phases such as Ni3Nb and Ni-2(Cr,Mo) as well as carbides such as
   NbC,Cr23C6 in the microstructure. While the microhardness and tensile

AB The dependence of Portevin-Le ChA cent telier (PLC) effect on the gamma'

   conditions has been studied by analyzing the parameters of the tensile
   curves and the deformation mechanisms. It is shown that the gamma'
   precipitates with different sizes, edge-to-edge interprecipitate
   distance, and areal number density are obtained by altering the aging
   time. It is demonstrated that when the mean size of the gamma'
   precipitates is less than 28 nm (aging less than 25 hours), the
   deformation mechanisms are dominated by APB-coupled a/2aOE (c) 101 >
   dislocations shearing the small gamma' precipitates and the slip bands
   continuously cutting the gamma and gamma' phases. When the gamma' size
   is between 28 and 45 nm (aging time between 25 and 50 hours), the
   deformation mechanism is controlled by the APB-coupled a/2aOE (c) 101 >
   dislocations shearing the small gamma' precipitates, the a/6aOE (c) 112
   > Shockley partial dislocation continuously shearing the gamma and
   gamma' phases combined with matrix dislocations by-passing the gamma'
   precipitates; If the gamma' size over 45 nm (aging time more than 50
   hours), Orowan by-passing becomes the main deformation mechanism.
   Moreover, with increasing the aging time, the critical plastic strain
   for the onset of the PLC effect increases and reaches a maximum after
   aging for 50 hours, and then gradually decreases. At last, the
   dependence of critical plastic strain on the deformation mechanisms is
   well explained by the elementary incremental strain (gamma). The
   precipitation process of the gamma' phase can directly influence the PLC
   effect by changing the interactions among solutes atoms, mobile
   dislocations, and forest dislocations.

AB Selective electron beam melting (SEBM) is a powder-bed-based additive
   manufacturing process that was used to produce cylindrical and
   columnar-grained parts made of Ni-base superalloy CMSX-4 from
   pre-alloyed and atomized powder. SEBM is characterized by high
   temperature gradients during solidification, which results in a very
   fine microstructure that is several orders of magnitude smaller than in
   conventionally cast material. This opens up new perspectives regarding
   time-consuming solution heat treatment. Nevertheless, microstructural
   heterogeneities, such as segregation and porosity, are still present on
   a much smaller scale, and also the high susceptibility to cracking of
   this alloy class during welding has to be taken into account. Since the
   latest generation of hot isostatic presses (HIP) are able to
   simultaneously heat-treat and eliminate porosity owing to their
   quenching capability, such a HIP is used in this work. The influence of
   different HIPing-heat-treatment-strategies with variation of temperature
   and time at a constant pressure on the SEBM-microstructure was
   investigated with emphasis primarily on segregation and porosity. The
   results demonstrate that only a few minutes of solutioning are
   sufficient to dissolve segregations and to close pores. The initial
   degree of homogeneity of the SEBM-material is responsible for the short
   solutioning-time. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

   degrees C for 1 min which were detected as Cr- and Ni-borides. The
   morphology and composition of phases at diffusion affected zone (DAZ)
   were somewhat different in IN-718 and IN-738 halves. Increasing the
   bonding time at 1050 and 1100 degrees C bonding temperatures increased
   the degree of isothermal solidification. In case of the samples,
   TLP-bonded at 1150 degrees C, the diffusion of the liquid phase into the
   grain boundaries of the base metals occurred and a wavy bonding
   interface and no DAZ phases were observed. A critical bonding
   temperature (between 1100 and 1150 degrees C) was seen above which the
   rate of isothermal solidification was reduced. Larson-Miller equation (P
   = T-B [C + ln(t(B))]) was used to estimate the required time for

   analyzed by the finite element method which was also used for monitoring
   the growth of the alpha-Al2O3 scale during the successive thermal cycles
   (birth & death element analysis). The aluminum oxide scale appeared to
   be continuous and compact. The stress level depended on the surface
   roughness of the interface between the intermetallic layer and the oxide
   scale and was the highest in the region of its surface peaks and the
   lowest in the valleys where it was compressive.
   The coatings composed of the diffusive beta-NiAl intermetallic layer,
   about 11 mu m thick, and the alpha-Al2O3 scale had a high thermal shock
   resistance and very good corrosion resistance. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB The integrity of turbine blades is essential for the safe operation of
   jet engines. Thus, the mechanical properties, especially creep
   resistance and fatigue strength at high temperatures, must be thoroughly
   optimized. In particular, it has previously been observed that the
   mechanical properties of blades depend on the microstructure and
   porosity resulting from the casting process. To decrease the internal
   porosity generated by investment casting, hot isostatic pressing can be
   applied. This paper aims to evaluate the effects of hot isostatic
   pressing on the microstructure of IN713C alloy blades. Two variants of
   hot isostatic pressing treatment, differing in pressure, were carried
   out, and each resulted in lowered porosity. Microstructural
   investigations, performed using scanning electron microscopy and
   electron backscatter diffraction revealed significant changes of gamma'
   particles and high strain intensity in the surface layer of the blades
   after hot isostatic pressing treatment.

PY 2016
AB The use of resonant ultrasound spectroscopy (RUS) as a nondestructive
   evaluation (NDE) technique for Ni-base single crystal superalloys has
   been investigated. Manufacture of single crystal superalloys can be
   challenging due to the prevalence of defects induced during single
   crystal growth or subsequent processing. Common defects involve the
   presence of misoriented (non-single crystal) material that change the
   bulk elastic properties and, as a result, are detectable by RUS. To
   control the extent of misoriented material, recrystallization induced by
   shot peening the surface of the single crystal has been studied. RUS was
   then used to determine the presence and depth of misoriented material
   due to recrystallization. Recrystallization of shot peened cylindrical
   single crystal specimens occurred to a depth of 80 mu m and 178 mu m
   during subsequent heat treatments. Experimental average resonance
   frequency shifts of 1.835% +/- 1.704% and 2.380% +/- 2.910%,
   respectively, were measured over a frequency range from 20-200 kHz when
   compared to the baseline shot peened condition. Finite element (FE)
   models using the ABAQUS Lanczos Eigen frequency solver assessed the
   influence of recrystallization as a function of depth from the surface
   and showed good agreement with the measured resonance frequency shifts.
   For the greatest NDE sensitivity on production-scale turbine blades and
   other gas turbine components, a coupled RUS measurement and FE modeling
   approach is essential, and has the potential to improve single crystal
   processing approaches and manufacturing yields. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Ni-base superalloys are important to the gas turbine airfoils due to
   their excellent high temperature properties. Though sufficient works
   have done for their application, the attentions on performance of
   complex geometries under thermal mechanical fatigue loadings still do
   not match its importance. In the present paper, thermomechanical fatigue
   (TMF) of a notched directionally solidified (DS) nickel based superalloy
   DZ125 was experimentally investigated. 500 degrees C to 1000 degrees C
   Out-of-phase (OP) TMF cycles were performed in longitudinal grain
   orientation of the cylindrically-notched specimens. The test results
   show a significant fatigue life reduction effect is found with the
   increased notch-severity. Through Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM)
   observations, the cracks initiate around the notches with heavy
   oxidation. However, the cracks located at the maximum Mises stress or
   Principle stress tend to form as the main cracks and cause the final
   failure. Hence, the combination of surface oxidation and stress
   concentration (Kt) dominates the failure procedure. (C) 2016 Elsevier

AB Selective laser melting (SLM) of nickel-based superalloys is of great
   interest for the aerospace industry due to its capability for producing
   components with complex geometries. However, an improved understanding
   of the effect of SLM and subsequent post deposition heat treatments on
   the microstructure and mechanical properties is required to ensure that
   components with good structural integrity are produced. In this study,
   the microstructure, texture and elastic anisotropy of the nickel-based
   superalloy, CM247LC, in the as-SLM and heat-treated states have been
   analysed. The as-SLM microstructure showed fine elongated cells with a
   preferential alignment of < 001 > along the build direction and a
   significant intercellular misorientation. Heat treatments at
   temperatures below 1230 degrees C resulted in a progressive recovery of
   the microstructure, whilst heat treatments above this temperature gave
   rise to a re crystallised microstructure. The extent to which nucleation
   and growth of the gamma' precipitates and secondary particles were
   affected by increasing the heat treatment temperature was also
   characterised. The bulk elastic anisotropy of all samples was measured
   by resonant ultrasound spectroscopy (RUS) and was found to be consistent
   with the local textures obtained by electron backscatter diffraction
   (EBSD). It was observed that the initially strong elastic anisotropy
   exhibited by the as-SLM material was significantly reduced in the
   recrystallised samples, although some anisotropy was retained as a
   result of their elongated grain microstructures. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB Microstructure evolution and mechanical properties of sample produced by
   laser powder deposition using blended powders of Mar M247 and Amdry DF3
   were studied in the as-deposited and heat treated conditions. In the
   as-deposited condition, continuous (Cr, W) borides and gamma-Ni3B
   eutectics were observed to segregate in the interdendritic regions.
   After the two-step aging treatment, the low melting point gamma-Ni3B
   eutectics re-melted. Small size gamma-gamma' eutectics and discrete W
   borides formed during re-solidification. The gamma' strengthening phase
   that precipitated out homogeneously in the dendritic cores had an
   average diameter of 102 +/- 26 nm. When annealing was attempted before
   the aging treatment, both gamma-Ni3B eutectics and the surrounding
   dendrites re-melted, contributing to the coarsening of the gamma-gamma'
   eutectics and the discrete W borides. Gamma prime precipitates with
   average diameter of 106 30 nm were observed. This microstructure
   evolution from the re-melting of gamma-Ni3B eutectics and development of
   gamma-gamma' eutectics eradicated the risk of strain-age cracks during
   the two tested heat treatments by backfilling. The coarsening kinetics
   of gamma' precipitates in the two heat treated conditions was modeled
   and showed a good agreement with the experimental observation. The
   microhardness results showed that the as-deposited condition possessed
   the highest hardness attributed to the continuous feature of the
   secondary phases, while the two heat treated conditions presented
   similar hardness owing to the similar size and volume fraction of gamma'
   precipitates. The tensile test results at both ambient and elevated
   temperatures indicated that the two types of heat treatments increased
   the tensile properties, especially ductility. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

AB To optimize the casting procedure, the effect of zircon and alumina
   ceramic molds on the microstructure, macrostructure and the

   process were thoroughly studied. In this regard, the experimental
   cooling curves, secondary dendrite arm spacing (SDAS) and the grain
   structure of the solidified IN738LC superalloy in both ceramic molds
   were compared with the values derived from simulation through ProCAST
   software and 3-D cellular automaton-finite element (CAFE) model.
   Furthermore a model was developed to predict the size of SDAS versus
   solidification time for both alumina and zircon molds. The results
   showed that the grain size and gamma/gamma' eutectic islands developed
   in the zircon mold were larger than those formed in the alumina mold,
   thereby revealing a good agreement with the simulation results. Also,
   metallographic evaluations showed that in IN738LC solidified in the
   alumina mold, the SDAS gradient was about 10 mu m.cm(-1) from the
   surface to the center of sample, marking a disadvantage for this type of
   mold, while in the zircon mold, the SDAS gradient was about 1.5 mu m
   cm(-1) in the similar direction. Quantitative analysis of SEM images
   also showed that during solidification, with an increase in the cooling
   rates from about 0.4 degrees C s(-1) to 1.1 degrees C s(-1), the size of
   gamma' precipitates decreased from about 500 nm to 290 nm, while their
   volume fraction during heat treatment increased from 46% to 53%. Based
   on more desirable microstructural features derived, alumina mold is
   found to be a more appropriate option for investment casting of IN738LC
   superalloy, compared to its zircon counterpart. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

   at the carbides in the uncoated alloy. For the coated specimen after 10
   h annealing, cracks were initiated mostly in the IDZ layer, due to the
   presence of mu-TCP phases. For the coated specimen after 50 h annealing,
   cracks were generated at the top of triangle-shaped gamma '-Ni3Al phases
   where stress concentration occurred, which finally propagated into the

AB Austenitic alloys are prone to cracking as a result of their poor hot
   ductility during continuous casting and hot working processes. In this
   study, hot tensile tests were performed to study the effect of Mg
   content on the hot ductility of Fe-36Ni alloy over the temperature range
   of 700-1200 degrees C at a strain rate of 10(-2) s(-1). The effects of
   the Mg content on the particle (i.e., inclusion and precipitate)
   characteristics and the growth of austenite grains were also
   investigated. The results indicated that the number density of the
   particles increased significantly while the mean diameter decreased with
   increasing Mg content in the experimental alloys. The growth of
   austenite grains was effectively inhibited by pinning particles in the
   Mg-treated alloys during solution treatment. Both the pinning particle
   and austenite grain size markedly affected the hot ductility behaviors
   of the alloys. The hot ductility curves of the studied alloys had
   different trends in the intermediate temperature range and were
   controlled by the competition between dynamic recrystallization (DRX)
   and grain boundary sliding (GBS). Compared with the alloys without Mg
   addition, an appropriate number of pinning particles in the alloy with
   49 ppm Mg addition resulted in a smaller grain size during the solution
   treatment, which significantly improved the hot ductility by
   accelerating DRX during the subsequent hot tensile process. However, an
   excessive number of pinning particles at grain boundaries in the alloy
   with 60 ppm Mg addition inhibited DRX and promoted GBS during the hot
   tensile process, which were detrimental to the hot ductility. In
   contrast, the alloys exhibited similar hot ductility troughs at higher
   temperatures, indicating that Mg has only a slight effect on the hot
   ductility at these temperatures. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   Rare recovery and recrystallization were observed indicating that other
   deformation mechanisms might be enhanced during the deformation process.
   Except for the pinning effect, deformation happened within gamma' phases
   and also gamma' phase promoted the deformation of the matrix. When the
   slipping was inhibited by gamma' phases, twinning acted as a deformation
   mechanism in fine-grained U720LI. Due to the retardation effect of
   gamma' phases in the early stage of the deformation process, local grain
   boundary migration took effect. Once grain boundaries crossed gamma'

   temperature transformation. Noticeable deviation from the equilibrium
   volume fraction of gamma' phase is detected in both the dissolution and
   precipitation processes above 1,120 degrees C for both moderate cooling
   and heating rate; differences were mainly attributed to the unsteady
   nature of the turbulent flow. The growth and alignment of the gamma'
   precipitates are deeply influenced by several factors, e.g. ageing time,
   cooling rate and quenching temperature. In addition, interesting
   findings such as "labyrinth" and "cluster" morphologies were observed by
   scanning electron microscope. During precipitation processes, the
   complicated microstructure evolution is illustrated by considering the

   under the interaction with its neighbors and the coherency of the

   phase precipitates and 8 phase precipitates, the most stable secondary
   phase of the alloy, with nearly, if not complete, dissolution of the
   Laves phase particles. Furthermore, the XPS analysis done in the study
   revealed the formation of nano-oxides within the deposited layer, which
   increased the microhardness of the superalloy in the as-deposited
   condition and inhibited its grain growth during post-process heat
   treatment. The microstructure analysis done in this work is crucial to
   the understanding of properties of the superalloy processed by the ESD

AB When drilling the superalloy Inconel 718 twist drills are faced with
   high thermomechanical loads. Owing to the low thermal conductivity of
   the workpiece material a large amount of the generated heat has to be
   transported away from the tool by the coolant. In this paper, the
   influence of the coolant pressure and the diameter of the coolant
   channels have been studied. The experiments have been supported by using
   computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations and were focused on the
   tool wear and the bore quality. The CFD simulation is a valuable tool
   which supported the present investigation, that a higher mass flux has
   no advantage regarding tool life and bore quality; moreover, the
   modification of the channel diameters has not reduced the thermal loads.
   In all investigated processes, dead zones near the cutting edge and the
   counter edge could not be reduced by increasing the flow rate. Only by
   the use of higher coolant pressures, the tool life could be
   significantly increased, as well as the bore quality. The investigations
   prove that especially when metrological methods reach their limits, the
   CFD is a suitable tool; which supports the design process effectively by
   giving a better insight into the coolant flow resulting from the complex
   drilling processes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The nonlinear unloading behavior of a typical Ni-based superalloy is
   investigated by hot compressive experiments with intermediate
   unloading-reloading cycles. The experimental results show that there are
   at least four types of unloading curves. However, it is found that there
   is no essential difference among four types of unloading curves. The
   variation curves of instantaneous Young's modulus with stress for all
   types of unloading curves include four segments, i.e., three linear
   elastic segments (segments I, II, and III) and one subsequent nonlinear
   elastic segment (segment IV). The instantaneous Young's modulus of
   segments I and III is approximately equal to that of reloading process,
   while smaller than that of segment II. In the nonlinear elastic segment,
   the instantaneous Young's modulus linearly decreases with the decrease
   in stress. In addition, the relationship between stress and strain rate
   can be accurately expressed by the hyperbolic sine function. This study
   includes two parts. In the present part, the characters of unloading
   curves are discussed in detail, and a new elasto-viscoplastic
   constitutive model is proposed to describe the nonlinear unloading
   behavior based on the experimental findings. While in the latter part
   (Chen et al. in Appl Phys A. doi: 10.1007/s00339-0160385-0, 2016), the
   effects of deformation temperature, strain rate, and pre-strain on the
   parameters of this new constitutive model are analyzed, and a unified
   elasto-viscoplastic constitutive model is proposed to predict the
   unloading behavior at arbitrary deformation temperature, strain rate,
   and pre-strain.

   Material parameters of the developed model are calibrated by a

   experimental and predicted results confirm that the developed unified
   dislocation density-based model can nicely reproduce hot deformation
   behavior, DRX kinetics, and grain size evolution in wide scope of

AB The oxidation behavior of a fine Ni superalloy (NiSA) powder, Inconel
   625, within an alumina support powder during heating has been determined
   using combined thermogravimetry (TG) and evolved gas analysis (EGA). A
   gas chromatographic-mass spectrometer (GCMS) was used for EGA. The GCMS
   was able to semi-quantitatively measure the rate at which air was
   removed from the furnace due to a He purge, where no pre-evacuation was
   used. It also was able to measure the effectiveness of a three cycle
   evacuation and He purge in reducing the oxygen content in the furnace
   and identify an important alumina off-gassing process that exposed the
   NiSA powder to H2O and CO2. The parallel use of the TG signal was able
   to quantitatively determine the relationship between NiSA oxidation and
   relative concentrations of the oxidizing gases created by the differing
   furnace pre-conditions and the alumina powder off-gassing process. It
   was concluded that the developed TG-GCMS method can be widely applied to
   quantitatively study oxygen pick-up in metal powders under industrially

   revealed presence of deformation bands at a temperature of 1323 K and a
   strain rate of 10 s(-1); whereas at temperatures above 1423 K, fine
   recrystallized grains were observed at all strain rates. Dynamic
   recrystallization (DRX) initiates at 1373 K. At 1473 K, sudden increase
   in the recrystallized grain size (DDRX) is noticed, indicating grain
   growth. Processing maps have been developed to delineate the regions of
   stable and unstable metal flow during high temperature deformation.
   Using Ziegler's continuum principles and processing maps, regions of
   stable metal flow was observed in the temperature range of 1323e1500 K
   and strain rate range of 0.1-1 s(-1). Activation energy (Q(avg)) for the
   alloy was found to be 421 kJ mol(-1). As Zener Holloman parameter (Z)
   increases, D-DRX decreases indicating higher nucleation, restricted
   grain growth, when deformation resistance is high. Constitutive equation
   and relation between 'Z' and D-DRX for the alloy has been established.

AB Deforming nickel base superalloys under the gamma' solvus retards
   dynamic recrystallisation (DRX) by hampering grain boundary motion; this
   is an efficient way of refining grain size during forging and other hot
   working processes. A previously proposed model for describing the
   kinetics of DRX in nickel alloys is here further developed to account
   for the influence of gamma' intermetallics, allowing predicting
   microstructural evolution during subsolvus deformation. The model
   incorporates alloy composition and initial grain size, as well as
   temperature and strain rate. It is calibrated with data for both
   supersolvus and subsolvus deformation. Plotting the calculated
   steady-state grain size as a function of the strain necessary to
   complete DRX allows visualising both processing and compositional
   trends, which are relevant to materials engineering and can be used for
   design. It is shown that efficient grain refinement cannot be achieved
   with a limited amount of strain if process or alloy optimisation alone
   is performed. Instead, it appears that this may only be reached by joint
   design of the forming process (strain rate and temperature) and
   composition. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Phase equilibria between 750 and 1100 A degrees C in the Co-rich portion
   of the Co-Al-W ternary system are investigated via isothermal annealing
   of five ternary alloy compositions. At temperatures of 900 A degrees C
   and below, the phase diagram is dominated by a three-phase tie-triangle
   between gamma, D0(19), and B2. The 1000 A degrees C section contains two
   three-phase tie-triangles, gamma A + D0(19) + mu and gamma + B2 + mu;
   while only one, gamma + B2 + mu, exists at 1100 A degrees C. Results at
   950 A degrees C suggest that it is possible that gamma' is in
   equilibrium, with four out of five compositions exhibiting
   microstructures supporting its thermodynamic stability, and the fifth
   composition containing only a very small amount of a fourth phase.
   However, if true, the temperature range of gamma' stability would be
   quite small, and it is more likely that the kinetics of gamma'
   dissolution are the cause of its persistence at 950 A degrees C. At 850
   A degrees C, gamma' is observed to dissolve more rapidly than at 900 A
   degrees C where dissolution exceeds 8000 h. A
   time-temperature-transformation diagram constructed from the combined
   results exhibits a classic nose-shape indicative of the tradeoff between
   thermodynamics and kinetics. This further supports a small driving force
   as the reason for the persistence of gamma' in the microstructures of
   Co-Al-W alloys at 900 and 950 A degrees C. The measured equilibrium
   phase compositions and five corresponding isothermal sections of the
   phase diagram will provide essential data for constructing a new
   thermodynamic description of ternary Co-Al-W.

AB Experimentation by TEM, EBSD and optical microscope is used to

   Hot compression is employed at different temperatures to provide driving
   force for recrystallization. Recrystallization sensitivity for this
   investigated alloy is provided. The results indicate that deformation
   temperature, as well as annealing conditions, has a great influence on
   recrystallization behavior. Samples deformed around 980 degrees C have
   the highest propensity for recrystallization, and stacking faults can
   facilitate the recrystallization process by themal twinning nucleation.
   Microstructural observation shows that as-cast inhomogeneity plays a
   significant role in the microstructure evolution, especially below
   gamma' phase solvus. Recrystallization nucleates first and grow rapidly
   in the dendritic arms. In the interdendritic regions, thermal twinning
   play the dominant role, and small grains remain after recrystallization
   is completed. Grain coarsening is rather difficult owing to abundant
   twinning grain boundaries. The eutectics in the IDRs can undergo
   recrystallization by themselves in the case of high plastic strains, and
   impede the grain boundaries at low plastic strains. (C) 2016 Elsevier

AB Inconel 718 specimens were additively manufactured via selective laser
   melting (SLM) and subjected to different post-process heat treatments.
   Performance under monotonic and cyclic loading in the low-cycle fatigue
   (LCF) regime was investigated at room temperature (RT). Hot isostatic
   pressing (HIP) was employed in order to reduce the porosity typically
   present after SLM. Prior functional encapsulation with a Ni-20Cr coating
   applied by cathodic arc deposition (Arc-PVD) was applied to achieve full
   densification. The results show that after Arc-PVD and HIP, the
   mechanical properties are not only affected by reduced porosity but also
   by substantial microstructural changes. Precipitates, i.e. Laves phase,
   already present in the as-built condition can be dissolved by solution
   heat treatment. HIP leads to recrystallization and thus significantly
   changes microstructural appearance. Elongated grains and sub-micron
   sized cell structures stemming from SLM processing are eliminated by
   HIP. Aging leads to evolution of strengthening gamma '' precipitates.
   Concurrently, delta phase forms upon HIP and aging. In comparison to
   aged conditions that were not subjected to HIP, microstructure upon HIP
   and aging results in improved ductility under monotonic loading,
   however, concomitantly deteriorates fatigue properties at RT. (C) 2016

AB Cast In740 Ni-based alloy with large grains generally show remarkable
   high temperature strength. However, this alloy is still have
   insufficient surface microstructure-dependent properties. In this study,
   for improvement of surface properties, surface modification of a cast
   In740 Ni-based superalloy was successfully performed by friction stir
   processing using a conventional two-horsepower milling machine and by
   additional heating to facilitate plastic flow of the hard alloy. Without
   using a high-power heavy stirring machine, a notable reduction in grain
   size of 2.9 mu m was achieved and a corresponding 30% increase in
   Vickers hardness was observed. The microstructure in the stir zone was
   analyzed in terms of the grain size and precipitate distribution. The
   result of the potential dynamic polarization test and in-situ acoustic
   emission monitoring show that electrochemical corrosion resistance was
   improved by this surface modification process.

   compression tests were carried out on HAYNES (R) 282 (R) specimens to
   varying strains from 0.1 to 0.8. Both single pass and multi-pass tests
   were completed. 60 min inter-pass times were utilized to accurately
   replicate industrial forging practices. The effect of dynamic,
   metadynamic and static recrystallization during inter-pass times on flow
   stress was investigated. The resulting microstructures were analysed
   using scanning electron, optical microscopy and EBSD to relate grain
   size and homogeneity with flow stress data. The study showed a
   negligible difference between multi-pass and single pass tests for
   strain increments above 0.2. Therefore, when modelling similar low
   strain and strain rate forging processes in HAYNES (R) 282 (R), previous

AB The nickel-base superalloy, Inconel 718, is widely used in aircraft

   during thermomechanical processing. The present study focuses on the

   super-delta-solvus domain (above 1050 degrees C) using laser
   ultrasonics. This technology is dedicated to the ultrasonic
   characterization of microstructure evolution during thermomechanical
   processing of metals and alloys. The real time measurement of the
   ultrasonic attenuation provides the evolution of a representative grain
   size in the material. A criterion is developed to determine the onset
   and completion of heterogeneous grain growth stages associated with the
   dissolution of precipitates. The laser ultrasonic methodology is
   validated with ex-situ metallographic observations and quantitative
   characterization of the grain size heterogeneity. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB A cellular automaton model (CA) with probabilistic state switches is
   developed to simulate the microstructural evolution in a Ni-based
   superalloy during static recrystallization (SRX). The kinetics of SRX is
   formulated on a me-soscale level. SRX nuclei grow under the driving
   pressure resulting from the reduction of stored energy and grain
   boundary energy. It is found that SRX grain size can be well predicted
   by the developed CA model. Solute elements of the studied superalloy
   have a drag effects on grain boundary motion. But, this solute drag
   effect is not obvious at high deformation temperatures. Nucleation rate
   of the SRX grain increases with the increase of strain, strain rate, and
   deformation temperature. Besides, the inhomogeneity of grain size first
   increases, then decreases with the increase of SRX fraction. The changes
   of inhomogeneity mainly result from the evolutions of the primary and

AB A new computational framework for systematic and optimal alloy design is
   introduced. It is based on a multi-objective genetic algorithm which
   allows (i) the screening of vast compositional ranges and (ii) the
   optimisation of the performance of novel alloys. Alloys performance is
   evaluated on the basis of their predicted constitutional and
   thermomechanical properties. To this end, the CALPHAD method is used for
   assessing equilibrium characteristics (such as constitution, stability
   or processability) while Gaussian processes provide an estimate of
   thermomechanical properties (such as tensile strength or creep
   resistance), based on a multi-variable non-linear regression of existing
   data. These three independently well-assessed tools were unified within
   a single C++ routine. The method was applied to the design of affordable
   nickel-base superalloys for service in power plants, providing numerous
   candidates with superior expected microstructural stability and
   strength. An overview of the metallurgy of optimised alloys, as well as
   two detailed examples of optimal alloys, suggest that improvements over
   current commercial alloys are achievable at lower costs.

   could potentially increase the efficiency of turbine engines. Compared
   to traditional GBE processes that require multiple iterations of room
   temperature deformation followed by annealing, novel techniques for GBE

   parameters exhibit more potential for producing complex-shaped Ni-based
   superalloys components. To date, the formation and microstructural
   evolution of I 3 pound boundaries during thermal-mechanical processing
   have yet to be fully understood. In this investigation, the effects of
   deformation texture and strain were systematically investigated in an
   advanced Ni-based superalloy, RR1000. Using various strains and
   annealing temperatures, the effects of recrystallization and texturing
   were quantified. Although texturing was often associated with
   recrystallization that caused the length fraction of I 3 pound
   boundaries to decrease, the formation of Goss type texture during
   deformation was found to promote the formation of I 3 pound boundaries

AB As precipitation hardening nickel-based super-alloy, the mechanical

   (HDR-LMD) are far lower than the relevant specifications, making it
   unable to be used in practical industry applications. With the purpose
   of improving its material performance, the current study has been
   carried out. The microstructure characteristics of the as-deposited
   161718 have been analysed, and the mechanical properties of it have been
   tested. Based on which, reasons that result in its poor mechanical
   properties have been identified. Furthermore, aiming to solve these
   problems the methods in order to improve material performance have been
   studies. It is found: the poor mechanical properties of the as-deposited
   161718 could be significantly improved by Wing (Hot Isostatic Pressing)
   and proper heat treatments. In addition, the mechanical properties of
   the heat-treated material are superior to AMS specifications for IN718
   fabricated by conventional manufacturing processes. It concluded: HIP
   can dramatically reduce the porosity of the as-deposited material; the
   columnar grains can be transformed to equiaxed grains by homogenization,
   eliminating material anisotropy; Laves phase could be dissolved by
   solution treatment, transforming to needle-like 6 phase; strengthening
   phases will be precipitated by double aging, therefore
   strengthening/hardening the material. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   inertial friction welded specimens showed that gamma' particles
   persisted during rapid heating up to a temperature where the formation
   of liquid is thermodynamically favoured, and subsequently re-solidified

   liquation cracking of the alloy. This is attributable to strain-induced
   rapid isothermal dissolution of the constitutional liquation products
   within 150 mm from the centre of the forged sample. This was not

   2 kg/h. Finally, microstructures and tensile properties of directly

   the results, precipitation of an irregular shaped phase, which is
   believed to be Laves phase, and segregation of Nb and Mo were found at
   interdendritic regions of the directly deposited material. The directly
   deposited material exhibited relative low tensile strength and 0.2%
   yield strength but high elongation. Moreover, due to recrystallization
   that occurred in heat treatment, columnar grains in the directly
   deposited material transformed to equiaxed grains. By heat treatment,

   be d phase, strength phases gamma' and gamma'', were precipitated. After
   heat treatment, tensile strength and 0.2% yield strength of the material
   were significantly enhanced, whereas the plastic elongation decreased by

   strategies with the resulting textures and corresponding anisotropy of
   the elastic behavior of bulk materials. Tensile test specimens made of
   the gamma'-containing Ni-base superalloy IN738LC were built with the
   loading direction oriented either parallel (z-specimens) or
   perpendicular to the build-up direction (xy-specimens). Their bulk
   mechanical properties were determined at room temperature and at 850
   degrees C. Specimens were investigated in the 'as-built' condition and
   after recrystallization heat treatment. SEM-based electron backscatter
   diffraction (EBSD) was applied to measure their crystallographic
   preferred orientations (texture) and to correlate the anisotropy of
   Young's modulus with the texture of the material. It is shown that the
   applied laser scanning strategies allow to tailor the crystallographic
   texture locally. The possibility to switch from transverse anisotropic
   to transverse isotropic properties and reverse is demonstrated for
   triple layered tensile samples. A recrystallization heat treatment
   reduces the degree of crystallographic texture and thus the elastic
   anisotropy by abundant annealing twinning. Predictions of Young's
   modulus calculated from the measured textures compare well with the data
   from tensile tests. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB NiCoCrAlY coatings were deposited on nickel-based superalloy by
   magnetron sputtering. The thermally grown oxide (TGO) layer of aluminum
   oxide (alpha-Al2O3) was formed on the surface of the NiCoCrAlY cating by
   heat treatment at 950 degrees C in an Ar atmosphere followed by
   subsequent thermal oxidation in air at 1100 degrees C. Another 2 pm
   thick Al2O3 film was deposited on the TGO layer by dual ion beam
   sputtering deposition (DIBSD) to further improve insulation resistance
   at high temperature. The effect of thermal oxide time on the morphology
   and microstructure of the TGO layers was investigated by SEM, XRD and
   XPS techniques. It's indicated that excessive thermal oxidation would
   produce NiO in the TGO layer, which was harmful to the high-temperature
   insulating property of TGO layer. The stoichiometric ratio Al/O for the
   sputtered Al2O3 film was close to 2:3. The electrical resistance of the
   insulating film was measured at 200 degrees C-800 degrees C. The result
   showed that the insulating Al2O3 film including TGO layer and sputtered
   Al2O3 layer had a good insulating property at high temperature. Finally,
   a thermal resistance temperature sensor was prepared on the surface of
   the Al2O3 film insulating film to verify its electrical insulating
   property. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The selective laser melting of high temperature alloys is of great
   interest to the aerospace industry as it offers the prospect of
   producing more complex geometries than can be achieved with other
   manufacturing methods. In this study, the microstructure of the
   nickel-based superalloy, CM247LC, has been characterised following
   selective laser melting and after a post deposition heat treatment below
   the gamma' solvus temperature. In the as-deposited state, scanning
   electron microscopy with electron backscatter diffraction revealed a
   fine, cellular microstructure with preferential alignment of < 001 >
   along the build direction. A high dislocation density was seen at the
   periphery of the cells, indicating substantial localised deformation of
   the material. Fine primary MC carbides were also observed in the
   inter-cellular regions. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy
   identified the occurrence of very fine gamma' precipitates,
   approximately 5 nm in diameter, dispersed within the gamma phase. After
   heat treatment, the elongated cell colonies were observed to partially
   coalesce, accompanied by a decrease in dislocation density, producing
   columnar grains along the build direction. Cuboidal gamma' precipitates
   approximately 500 nm in diameter were observed to form in the
   recrystallised grains, accompanied by larger gamma' precipitates on the
   grain boundaries. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) was used to study the

   stages (diffusion annealing after application of Pt bond coat and after
   secondary ageing following subsequent deposition of the Y2O3-stabilised
   ZrO2 top coat) and (b) thermal cycling in the Ni-base superalloy, CMSX4.
   In the thermal processing stages, an increased segregation of sulphur
   was observed within the upper regions of the Pt bond coat after
   diffusion annealing, while following secondary ageing, the sulphur
   segregation in this layer became heterogeneous with discrete pockets of
   enrichment (a parts per thousand << 1 ppm) and regions of depletion (a
   parts per thousand(a)1 ppm). During thermal cycling, partitioning of
   sulphur occurred to the Pt-enriched gamma' region characterised by the
   finger-like morphology, while examination of TBC spalled specimens
   showed significant depletion of sulphur within the substrate in the
   vicinity of the surface. The reservoir for sulphur-depletion within the
   substrate was definitively identified as the Pt-enriched gamma' region.
   A quantitative method for the calculation of sulphur-segregation at the
   surface in terms of mono-layers is presented.

PD APR 1 2016
PY 2016
AB In this interpretive review, fatigue in metallic systems is considered
   primarily from the perspective of interactions between the
   microstructure, the deformation mode and the mechanical state at both
   low and high temperatures. In Part 1 the development and early
   propagation of cracks is considered in terms of the basic damage
   mechanisms and the relative size of the crack with respect to applicable
   micro structural feature(s). In this section, a multistage grain scale
   approach to microstructure-sensitive fatigue crack formation and growth
   is presented which uses Fatigue Indicator Parameters (FIPs) to correlate
   these processes. Various FIPs parameters are discussed in terms of their
   indication of the state of fatigue. The development and early crack
   propagation is considered in the context of microstructure and notches,
   and probabilistic aspects of the notch fatigue problem are discussed.
   These features are integrated into a systematic approach for the
   selection of fatigue resistant microstructures for given applications.
   In Part 2, attention is focused on Ni-base superalloys and the
   interaction between oxidation, creep and microstructure (including
   coatings) in the formation and propagation of cracks. This part of the
   overview addresses both experimental and modelling aspects.
   Methodologies based upon fundamental physical processes are presented
   for understanding and predicting the development and propagation of
   fatigue cracks, including effects of sequential oxide type formation and
   of creep on either restraining or accelerating damage by oxidation. The
   variable fatigue resistance of discs in jet engines is seen to depend
   upon the variability of microstructure and its influence on the severity
   of creep oxidation interactions. All of these factors are considered in
   the practical case where both temperature and loading parameters vary
   simultaneously (thermomechanical fatigue). A physics-based life
   prediction model considering the interactions of deformation and
   environmental damage is reviewed in terms of its applicability to life
   prediction of components. (C) 2015 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by

PD APR 2016

AB A diffusion couple between directionally solidified nickel and the
   single crystal Ni-base superalloy CMSX-10 was produced by hot pressing
   in vacuum. The diffusion couples were heat treated at temperatures
   between 1050 and 1250 A degrees C. The exposed samples were
   characterized by SEM/EBSD/EPMA. The interdiffusion results in
   dissolution of the gamma'-Ni3Al in the superalloy and in growth of
   nickel grains towards CMSX-10. Rapid diffusion of aluminum from the
   superalloy into pure nickel leads to a significant formation of pores in
   the superalloy. The interdiffusion processes were modelled using the
   finite-element simulation software DICTRA with the databases TCNi5 and
   MobNi2, tailored specially for Ni-base superalloys. The effect of
   alloying elements on the interdiffusion profiles is discussed in terms
   of alloy thermodynamics. The calculated element concentration profiles
   are in good agreement with the EPMA measurements. The interdiffusion
   modeling correctly predicts the shapes of the concentration profiles,
   e.g. kinks on the Al and Ti profiles in the vicinity of the original
   interface in the joint. The calculation predicts with reasonable
   accuracy the extent and the location of the Kirkendall porosity.

   identifies the influence of process and material parameters on the
   resulting microstructure. Comprehensive microstructural characterization
   was performed using electron backscattered diffraction analysis.
   Significant differences between IN738LC and Mar-M509 were observed with
   respect to grain size, grain shape and texture sharpness. Alloy IN738LC
   exhibits coarse and elongated grains with a sharp texture and thus a
   pronounced mechanical anisotropy. Alloy Mar-M509 shows smaller grains
   with only moderate structural and mechanical anisotropy. The different
   micro structural and mechanical characteristics are attributed to the
   different recovery and recrystallization behavior of IN738LC and
   Mar-M509. The high stacking fault energy (SFE) of IN738LC results in
   pronounced recovery of lattice defects without affecting the basic grain
   structure, whereas the low SFE in Mar-M509 favors recrystallization with
   the effect of significant grain refinement and weakening of the
   solidification texture. The effect of microstructure and the structural
   anisotropy on the orientation-dependent values of the Young's modulus
   and the mechanical properties are further discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier

AB The thermal expansion behavior of five gamma'-(L1(2)) containing
   Co-based superalloys was measured using push-rod dilatometry. These
   results were analyzed to determine the mean coefficient of thermal
   expansion (CTE), the instantaneous CTE, and gamma'-solvus temperature of
   the alloys. The CTE was found to depend strongly on the gamma'-solvus
   temperature.
   In turbine applications, these alloys will be part of a multilayer
   system that generates thermal stresses due to the CTE mismatch between
   the components. To investigate this phenomenon, the CTE data was
   incorporated into a thermo-mechanical model to calculate the energy
   release rate (ERR) for the delamination of coatings from these alloys.
   The ERR of a thermally grown oxide (TGO) formed on the bare and bond
   coated Co-based alloys was determined as a function of superalloy and
   bond coat CTE. The ERR of a thermal barrier coating (TBC) was evaluated
   as a function of temperature, superalloy LIE, and coating thickness. The
   ERR was found to be about 1.5 x greater in Co-based superalloys compared
   to Ni-based superalloys cooled from T = 1100 degrees C to ambient.

AB In high temperature meso/micro plastic forming process, material yield
   and deformation are quite different from those at atmospheric
   temperature. The flow stress decreases quite obviously by the raise of
   forming temperature and is also modified by the change of inner grain
   numbers. Moreover, the traditional micro-forming theory is often
   crippled or rendered totally inefficient under thermal condition due to
   the interacted effects. To explore the coupled effect of grain size and
   deformation temperature on thermally-aided meso/micro-scale plastic
   deformation, uniaxial tensile tests of Inconel 718 sheets with different
   inner grain sizes are performed at diverse temperatures. The
   experimental results reveal that both yield stress and flow stress
   decrease with the increasing particle size and temperature. A strong
   grain size effect emerges at atmospheric temperature, while decays with
   the increase of deformation temperature. In addition, an exponential
   relationship between intercept stress and deformation temperature is
   established at specific strain level, while the slope decreases with the
   increasing temperature as well as the deformation strain level, which
   could be interpreted by the dislocation theory and the grain boundary
   strengthening effect. Furthermore, a modified Zerilli-Armstrong model is
   proposed to describe the flow stress considering the deformation
   temperature and grain size simultaneously. The research thus provides an
   in-depth understanding of the interactive effect of deformation
   temperature and material microstructure in meso/micro-scale plastic
   deformation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The structure and the formationmechanism of brittle eutectic phases and
   hot cracks formed at grain boundaries were investigated in two Ni-Mo-Cr
   superalloys with different silicon contents (0.06 and 0.46 wt.%). The
   eutectic phases and hot cracks can be observed along the rolling
   direction in the 0.46 wt.% Si heat when heated to 1335 degrees C or a
   higher peak temperature up to 1365 degrees C. Exposure to the higher
   peak temperatures resulted in the formation of larger eutectic phases
   and hot cracks in the higher silicon heat. Conversely, there are fewer
   eutectic phases and smaller hot cracks forming in the low-silicon heat
   when heated to 1365 degrees C. The eutectic phases were identified as
   gamma-M6C' type. Based on the constitutional liquation theory and
   thermodynamic calculations, it was found that the formation of the
   eutectic phases and hot cracks is due to the localized melting of
   primary M6C carbides and surrounding Si-riched matrix. The degree of
   elements segregation in liquid films determines whether liquid films
   solidify into eutectic phases or cause hot cracks. This model can
   reasonably explain the observed phenomena and contribute to designing

   for the BP-ANN model are 0.9998 and 1.20%. The results indicate that the
   BP-ANN model can accurately track the experimental data and show a good
   generalization capability to predict complex flow behavior. Then, a 3D
   continuous interaction space for temperature, strain rate, strain and
   stress was constructed based on the expanded data predicted by a

   the regression analysis of the experimental data. The dependences of

AB In this paper, we investigate microstructure and quasi-static mechanical
   behavior of the direct metal laser sintered Inconel 718 superalloy as a
   function of build direction (BD). The printed material was further
   processed by annealing and double-aging, hot isostatic pressing (HIP),
   and machining. We characterize porosity fraction and distribution using
   micro X-ray computed tomography (mu XCT), grain structure and
   crystallographic texture using electron backscattered diffraction
   (EBSD), and mechanical response in quasi-static tension and compression
   using standard mechanical testing at room temperature. Analysis of the
   mu XCT imaging shows that majority of porosity develops in the outer
   layer of the printed material. However, porosity inside the material is
   also present. The EBSD measurements reveal formation of columnar grains,
   which favor < 001 > fiber texture components along the BD. These
   measurements also show evidence of coarse-grained microstructure present
   in the samples treated by HIP. Finally, analysis of grain boundaries
   reveal that HIP results in a large number of annealing twins compared to
   that in samples that underwent annealing and double-aging. The yield
   strength varies with the testing direction by approximately 7%, which is
   governed by a combination of grain morphology and crystallographic
   texture. In particular, we determine tension-compression asymmetry in
   the yield stress as well as anisotropy of the material flow during
   compression. We find that HIP lowers yield stress but improves ductility
   relative to the annealed and aged material. These results are discussed
   and critically compared with the data reported for wrought material in

AB Isothermal compression tests of BSTMUF601 super-alloy in the temperature
   range of 950 degrees C-1200 degrees C and at the strain rates of 0.2
   s(-1), 5 s(-1), 10 s(-1) were performed on a Gleeble-1500D
   thermo-mechanical simulator. Based on the hyperbolic sine function, the
   unified constitutive equations and hot processing maps during the hot
   deformation process were established. The flow stress predicted by the
   constitutive equations shows good agreement with the corrected stress.
   Hot processing maps for hot working conditions were established based on
   exploring the effect of power dissipation efficiency and the instability
   coefficient associated with various kinds of temperatures and stain
   rates. Subsequently, power dissipation efficiency and the instability
   coefficient were interpreted based on hot processing maps under a series
   of strains, temperatures and strain rates. The results show that power
   dissipation efficiency increases gradually with the increasing
   temperature and the decreasing stain rate, and instability domains
   reduce first, then increase with the increase of true strain. The
   optimum hot working condition of BSTMUF601 super-alloy was obtained.

AB The kinetics of gamma' size and volume fraction changes during solution
   treatment of the advanced Ni-based superalloy, AD730 (TM) are determined
   and the underlying mechanisms are investigated. High resolution
   Differential Thermal Analysis (DTA) and thermodynamic modeling were used
   to design and perform solution heat treatment experiments.
   Semi-analytical models are developed to describe the dissolution and
   coarsening processes. The results from the proposed models, supported by
   electron microscopy observations, indicate that coarsening occurs before
   complete dissolution takes place. Agglomeration is shown to be the
   governing coarsening mechanism for this alloy after calculation of the
   coefficients for both the Ostwald ripening and agglomeration mechanisms.
   Electron microscopy observations revealed that the early stages of
   agglomeration occur by neck formation between two neighboring particles.
   The splitting of gamma' particles was identified as one of the main
   dissolution mechanisms. Based on the obtained results, a dissolution
   kinetics model is proposed to quantify the volume fraction of dissolved
   gamma' particles and estimate the activation energy of this process for
   AD730 (TM). A coarsening model based on the time-temperature dependence
   of the gamma' coarsening rate coefficient is also proposed taking the
   concentration of elements, gamma' volume fraction and the temperature
   into consideration. Based on this model, a method is developed to
   predict gamma' size evolution during aging heat treatment process and an
   optimum heat treatment to reach the desired gamma' distribution is
   proposed. The validity and accuracy of the proposed models were verified
   by carrying out different heat treatment experiments. (C) 2015 Elsevier

AB The influence of gamma' precipitate size on the tensile deformation
   mechanism in a new Ni-base superalloy is investigated at room
   temperature. In order to achieve this aim, three model microstructures
   are obtained by changing aging time. After tensile deformation, the
   substructures are characterized by transmission electron microscopy.
   Experimental results reveal that plastic deformation is controlled
   primarily by dislocations shearing gamma' precipitates in all three
   microstructures, and the operative shearing process evolves as a
   function of precipitate size. It is found that for the fine gamma'
   microstructure (241 nm), both stacking fault shearing and anti-phase
   boundary shearing operate simultaneously; in the case of the medium
   gamma' microstructure (446 nm), most of the gamma' precipitates are
   sheared by strongly coupled dislocations, leaving faulted loops within
   them; whereas for the coarse gamma' microstructure (597 nm), shearing
   occurs by the movement of small groups of dislocations. Finally, based
   on experimental observations, the relationship between the tensile
   strength and the activation of plastic deformation mechanisms is
   discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   1220 degrees C/175 MPa/4 h) a sound HIP bonding piece was created;
   especially in the intermediate layer, where very fine matrix grain and
   carbides were found. The fine carbides were uniformly precipitated in
   the matrix and grain boundaries, which may play a role in inhibiting

   850 degrees C/500 MPa and 1100 degrees C/130 MPa were conducted, and the
   microstructure of as-cast, heat treated and stress ruptured specimens
   were analyzed. It was found that the 1.5 wt% Mo addition enhanced the
   stress-rupture lives at both intermediate (850 degrees C) and high (1100
   degrees C) temperatures. The microstructure analysis showed that adding
   1.5 wt% Mo in the basic alloy affected the microstructure dramatically,
   i.e., the Mo-rich phases formed in the specimens of as-cast and
   stress-ruptured specimens. It is considered that the improvement of the
   stress-rupture lives is duo to the strengthening effect of Mo to both
   gamma and gamma' phases and the decrease of stacking fault energy,
   diffusion constant and dislocation spacing. The Mo-rich phases
   precipitated under condition of 1100 degrees C/130 MPa did not affect

AB Cylindrical specimens of Inconel 718 alloys with three types of grain
   size distribution were used in the compression tests and processing maps
   were developed in 940-1040 degrees C and 0.001-10 s(-1). The equiaxed
   fine grain is more effective on the dynamic softening behavior. For
   partial recrystallized microstructure, the peak efficiency of power
   dissipation occurs at the strain rate of 0.001 s-1, and the temperature
   range of 1000-1020 degrees C. In order to obtain homogeneous
   microstructure with fine grains, the partial recrystallized
   microstructure should be deformed at the low temperature and slow strain
   rates. The area fraction of instability domains decreases with strain
   increasing. The peak efficiency of power dissipation increases with
   average grain size decreasing. The efficiency of power dissipation will
   be stimulated by the precipitation of phase at slow strain rate of
   0.001-0.01 s(-1), and the initial deformed substructure at the strain
   rate of 0.11 s(-1). Equiaxed fine grain is the optimum state for forging
   process and dynamic recrystallization. The grain size distribution has
   slight influence on the microstructure evolution at high temperatures.

AB Co-Cr-W HVOF-sprayed protective coatings are used for their high

   stability of their mechanical properties in relation to thermal loading
   is crucial with respect to the most common high-temperature application
   areas. This work is focused mainly on evaluation of the heat-induced
   changes in the phase composition and related mechanical properties. It
   was shown that the original powder, composed fully from face-centered
   cubic Co-based alloy, partly changes its phase composition during
   spraying to a hexagonal close-packed (hcp) structure. The annealing
   further increases the ratio of the hcp phase in the structure. The
   heat-induced phase changes are accompanied by an increase in the
   coatings' hardness and cohesion strength. The abrasive and adhesive wear
   behavior was evaluated. While the coatings' heat treatment had a
   positive effect on the coefficient of friction, the abrasive and
   adhesive wear resistance of annealed coating was lower compared to
   as-sprayed coating.

   to characterise the microstructural features such as grain orientation
   and morphology, grain boundary characteristics and the identification of

   microstructural variation was found to be highly dependent on the value
   of local strain imparted during forging such that areas of low effective

   was observed following heat treatment. Meanwhile, a fully recrystallised

   boundary (PPB) precipitated during the powder metallurgy process. Since
   undesirable PPB is detrimental to mechanical properties, hot extrusion
   or/and isothermal forging are needed. In present research, isothermal
   compression tests were conducted on P/M FGH4096 superalloys with typical
   PPBs. Abnormal flow behavior during high-speed deformation has been
   quantitatively investigated. Caused by the competition mechanism between
   work-hardening and dynamic-softening, abnormal flow behaves typical four
   stages (viz., work-hardening, stable, softening and steady).
   Microstructure observation for hardening or/and softening mechanism has
   been investigated. Meanwhile, necklace microstructure was observed by
   scanning electron microscope, and the grain fraction analysis was
   performed by using electron backscatter diffraction. Transmission
   electron microscopy was used for characterizing the boundary structure.
   Necklace microstructural mechanism for processing P/M superalloys has
   been developed, and the dynamic recrystallization model has also been
   conducted. Bulge corrugation model is the primary nucleation mechanism
   for P/M superalloys with PPBs. When PPB is entirely covered with new
   grains, necklace microstructure has formed. Bulge corrugation mechanism
   can repeatedly take place in the following necklace DRX. (C) 2015

   the joint region were eliminated markedly while these phases were stable
   after 1 h homogenizing at the same temperature. Recrystalization at the

   temperature. At the same region, homogenizing treatment at 1225 degrees
   C led to intercellular carbide dissolving and recrystallization. At this
   temperature, grain boundaries liquation and precipitation coarsening
   occurred. The results of shear tests showed that, the shear strength of

   under different processing conditions. The influences of process
   parameters on microstructure and mechanical properties of joints were
   investigated. The results indicate that sound microstructure such as
   fine recrystallized grains in the weld zone could be obtained under
   certain conditions. Microstructural examination shows that grains in the
   thermomechanically affected zone present no obvious deformation.
   Moreover, the segregation of some impurity elements along grain
   boundaries and the reversion of gamma '' and gamma' caused by high
   interface temperature during welding lead to the reduction of joint
   mechanical property. The microhardness and tensile strength of joints
   are lower than those of the parent metal. In addition, a weak layer
   including residues of oxides and carbides on the extremities of the
   joint is formed unexpectedly, which is detrimental to joint integrity.

AB The effect of the surface quality of multi-film cooling holes processed
   by laser drilling (LD) and electrical discharge machining (EDM) on the
   mechanical properties of blades have been studied. The physical features
   of the cooling holes, including the diameter, conicity and shape of the
   holes, are measured by optical microscopy, demonstrating that the EDM
   process is not as accurate as the LD process. Meanwhile, metallurgical
   characteristics, including the recast layer, heat affected zone and
   micro-cracking within the surface layer, are analysed by scanning
   electron microscopy, demonstrating that the radial crack generated in
   the LD process is more dangerous than the circumferential cracks
   generated in the EDM process. Using finite element analysis (FEA), the
   single crystal superalloy specimens with multi-film holes are simulated
   based on the crystal plasticity theory, showing that a significant
   increase of the stress gradient is observed in a real hole model than in
   an ideal circular hole model, which means that a shape simplification in
   the blade design will reduce the reliability of the blade. Based on the
   findings above, the influence of the surface quality of holes is
   investigated to obtain the possible damages to nickel single crystal
   turbine blades.

AB Dendritic segregation of directionally solidified columnar and

   derived from EDS measurements on as-cast samples in both transversal and
   longitudinal sections have shown strong segregation tendency of elements
   either to dendrite cores (Re, W) or to the interdendritic regions (Al,
   Ti, Ta). The dendritic segregation as a function of various secondary
   dendrite arm spacings (SDAS) has highlighted that Ti segregation is more
   sensitive to the SDAS than that of the other elements. It was also found
   that Cr has a tendency to accumulate at the coarse gamma prime-matrix
   interface. The solidification partition coefficients calculated with
   Pandat and the PanNi thermodynamic database showed a good agreement with
   the experimental data. Pandat calculations using the local chemical
   composition of segregated areas were also used for the optimisation of
   the solutioning heat treatment window. Primary ((1)) and secondary ((2))
   arm spacings as important parameters that influence the dendritic
   segregation were measured for single-crystal rods at different distances
   from the cooling plate. Fitting equations were established for the
   experimental (1) and (2) as a function of cooling rate, the
   V(-0.25)G(-0.5) product and the local solidification time. Analytical
   calculations of the dendrite arm spacing compared with the experiments

   deposition may influence fatigue properties of the coated samples
   differently. In the presented study, testing was carried out for TBC
   samples deposited on industrially more relevant Hastelloy X substrates.
   Samples were tested after each step of the TBC deposition process:
   as-received (non-coated), grit-blasted, bond-coated (NiCoCrAlY), and
   bond-coated + top-coated yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ). Conventional
   atmospheric plasma spraying (APS) was used for deposition of bond coat
   and top coat. In addition, for one half of the samples, dual-layer bond
   coat was prepared by combination of high-velocity air-fuel (HVAF) and
   APS processes. Samples were tested in the as-sprayed condition and after
   100 hours annealing at 980 degrees C, which simulated
   application-relevant in-service conditions. Obtained results showed that
   each stage of the TBC manufacturing process as well as the simulated
   in-service heat exposure may significantly influence the fatigue
   properties of the TBC coated part. HVAF grit-blasting substantially
   increased the fatigue performance of the uncoated substrates. This
   beneficial effect was suppressed by deposition of APS bond coat but not
   by deposition of dual-layer HVAF+ APS bond coat. All heat-treated
   samples showed again enhanced fatigue performance.

AB The hot deformation behaviors of a solution-treated Ni-based superalloy
   are investigated by hot compression tests over wide ranges of strain
   rate and forming temperature. Based on the experimental data, the
   effects of forming temperature and strain rate on the hot deformation
   behaviors are discussed in detail. Considering the effects of strain on
   material constants, comprehensive constitutive models are developed to
   describe the relationships between the flow stress, strain rate and
   forming temperature for the studied superalloy. The three-dimensional
   processing map is constructed to optimize the hot working parameters.
   Meanwhile, the microstructures are analyzed to correlate with the
   processing map. It is found that the flow stress is sensitive to the
   forming temperature, strain rate and deformation degree. With the
   increase of forming temperature or the decrease of strain rate, the flow
   stress significantly decreases. The predicted flow stresses agree well
   with experimentally measured results, which confirm that the developed
   constitutive model can accurately estimate the flow stress of the
   studied superalloy. The three-dimensional processing map shows that the
   optimum deformation windows for hot working are the domains with
   980-1,040 degrees C or 0.001-0.1 s(-1) when the strain is 0.6. Also, it
   is found that the dynamically recrystallized grain size increases with
   the increase of forming temperature or the decrease of strain rate.

   Axial shortening and macroscopic morphology of linear friction welded

   Particularly, misruns often occur in the as-cast complex shape parts due
   to the formation of solid skin by freezing of melt in contact with

   tubes are designed and fabricated from the material used for the
   manufacturing of ceramic moulds for investment casting.
   Melting/solidification experiments are carried out in the
   thermo-mechanical simulator, where the melt is contained in the ceramic
   tube, which is heated to the temperature of ceramic mould in investment
   casting. Detailed microstructural characterization of the solidified
   specimens is performed; the obtained results predict the thickness of
   skin and its microstructure. This concept is applied to investment
   casting of complex shape nozzle guide vanes from the Mar-M247 Ni-based
   superalloy. Experimental casting trials are performed, and the outcomes
   of physical simulation tool are validated against experimental results.

AB Thermomechanical fatigue (TMF) is a low cycle fatigue process in which
   material life is correlated to the mechanical strain amplitude. However,
   it is well known that several other factors influence this life. This
   paper examines several of these parameters and their influence on life
   using experiments conducted on a second generation
   directionally-solidified (DS) Ni-base superalloy. The parameters
   considered include the influence of the temperature extremums (T-max of
   either 750 or 950 degrees C and T-min, of either 100 or 500 degrees C),
   strain ratio (R-e), the strain-temperature phasing (in-phase (IP) and
   out-of-phase (OP)), the influence of dwells at the high temperature end
   of the cycle resulting in a creep-fatigue (CF) interaction, and material
   anisotropy associated with the grain growth direction (longitudinal
   versus transverse). Results suggest that the phasing has a primary role
   in controlling the mechanism of degradation. IP TMF is dominated by
   crack formation in volumes surrounding debonded carbides for both
   continuously cycling (CC) and CF at 950 and 750 degrees C, while OP TMF
   is dominated by surface oxidation and repetitive cracking of the oxide
   that reforms at the crack tip at 950 degrees C. Decreasing the T-max to
   750 degrees C the environmental and creep effects are reduced resulting
   in virtually pure fatigue exposure under OP conditions. With decreasing
   T-min from 500 degrees C to 100 degrees C was observed an increase in
   inelastic strain amplitude and corresponding decrease in life.
   Variations in R-epsilon were found to have no significant influence on
   life or stabilized stress behavior. TMF loading in the transverse
   orientation resulted in life reductions over the longitudinal

AB Hot deformation behaviors of two pre-treated nickel-based superalloys
   are investigated over wide ranges of strain rate and temperature. Based
   on the theory of dynamic material model (DMM), the processing maps are
   developed and correlated with the deformed microstructures. The effects
   of pre-treatment, including water-cooling and furnace-cooling
   pre-treatments, on the hot deformation behavior and processing maps are
   discussed in detail. It is found that the hot deformation behavior and
   processing map of the aged superalloy are sensitive to pre-treatment.
   The peak stress of the aged superalloy after furnace-cooling
   pre-treatment is larger than that after water-cooling pre-treatment.
   Considering the coupled effects of deformation temperature, strain and
   strain rate, the phenomenological constitutive models of two pre-treated
   nickel-based superalloys are established. Meanwhile, the flow
   instability domains of the aged superalloy after furnace-cooling
   pre-treatment are narrower than those after water-cooling pre-treatment.
   At the true strain of 0.6, the flow instability domain of the aged
   superalloy after water-cooling pre-treatment is (920-1010 degrees C,
   0.1-1s(-1)), while that after furnace-cooling pre-treatment is (930-970
   degrees C, 0.1-1s(-1)). Additionally, the dynamic recrystallized grain
   size of the studied superalloy after furnace-cooling pre-treatment is
   smaller than that after water-cooling pre-treatment. (C) 2015 Elsevier

   billet was analyzed in terms of density, texture, and grain size.
   Comparative research was done on the microstructure and mechanical
   properties between the flat disk preform prepared with hot isostatic
   pressing (HIP) and the same alloy forgings prepared with HIP followed by
   isothermal forging (IF). The results show that the density of the
   spray-formed and nitrogen-atomized deposit billet is above 99% of the
   theoretical density, indicating a compact structure. The grains are
   uniform and fine. The billet has weak texture with a random distribution
   in the spray deposition direction and perpendicular to the direction of
   deposition. A part of atomizing nitrogen exists in the preform in the
   form of carbonitride. Nitrogen-induced microporosity causes the density
   reduction of the preform. Compared with the process of HIP+IF, the
   superalloy FGH4095M after HIP has better mechanical properties at both
   room temperature and high temperature. The sizes of the gamma' phase are
   finer in microstructure of the preform after HIP in comparison with the
   forgings after HIP+IF. This work shows that SF+HIP is a viable
   processing route for FGH4095M as a turbine-disk material.

AB The deformation behavior of Alloy 617B was investigated by the

   with strain rates of 0.01-20 s(-1) on a Gleeble-1500 thermo-mechanical

   workability and microstructural evolution during hot deformation. The
   temperature correction was invited here for high strain rate condition
   to get more accurate processing map. The results show that the
   processing parameters have significant effects on power dissipation
   efficiency and instability factors. The unsafe domains are detected at
   the high strain rate (> 10 s(-1))condition and is characterized by
   uneven microstructure and high density twins, which should be avoided in
   hot working process. The optimum hot working condition are obtained in
   the temperature range of 1120-1165 degrees C and strain rate scope of
   0.01-0.1 s(-1) with the peak power dissipation efficiency of 48%.
   Another domain of 1170-1210 degrees C and 0.1-4.5 s(-1) can also be
   chosen as the optimal working condition at large strains (>0.8). In
   these two optimum domains, the original grains are substituted by fine
   dynamic recrystallization (DRX) grains and DRX is the main power
   dissipation mechanism. The dominant nucleation mechanism of DRX in the
   safe domain is the bulging of original grain boundaries accompanied with
   twining, which is the feature of discontinuous dynamic recrystallization
   (DDRX). Some characteristics of continuous dynamic recrystallization
   (CDRX) can also be found when deformed at strain rate of 1
   s(-1),although it can only be considered as an assistant nucleation
   mechanism. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Nickel-base superalloys are used in highly demanding applications such
   as energy and aerospace industries. These alloys present good corrosion
   resistance, weldability and mechanical stability at high temperatures.
   Numerical methods are commonly used to predict the mechanical and
   microstructural behavior of heat resistant alloys. The aim of the
   present work was to model recrystallized grain size evolution under
   isothermal conditions using the cellular automata (CA) technique. The CA
   model was applied to simulate hot compression of Inconel 718 nickel-base
   alloy at 980 degrees C and 1020 degrees C. A finite element analysis was
   conducted to acquire input parameters to the model such as strain and
   strain rate. Hardening and recovery coefficients were calculated in
   order to represent the competitive effects during deformation. The
   influence of local changes of initial grain with fully and partial
   recrystallized microstructures were simulated by CA and compared with
   isothermal hot compression results. The model was able to
   comprehensively predict necklace type microstructures. The average grain
   size was generally in good agreement with the experimental data. (C)

AB Hot forging of Inconel 718 is an essential process to give shape and
   in-use properties to final part design. Dynamic recrystallization is the
   main mechanism influencing the properties through a grain size control.
   It is then of crucial importance to be able to predict the mechanical
   behavior during forging and the microstructure evolution during and
   after the dynamic recrystallization. A coupling between a crystal
   plasticity finite element model and a recrystallization model using a 3D
   cellular automata approach is applied to a 3D polycrystalline aggregate
   deformed by compression. Beyond the prediction of the stress-strain
   curves at different strain rates, numerical simulations enable the
   visualization of stress, strain, energy, local orientation, dislocation
   density fields within the aggregate. Finally, the recrystallization
   kinetic and the grain size are recorded as a function of strain. The
   results are in a rather good agreement with experiments, even if the
   predicted grain size is slightly larger than the measured one. To
   improve the prediction, annealing twinning is accounted for. (C) 2015

   Fracture toughness and impact tests were performed on sintered and aged

   microscope. The results revealed that aging heat treatment led to the
   formation of some carbides and intermetallic phases in the

   has been studied. Isothermal creep (from 750 degrees C up to 1200
   degrees C) and low cycle fatigue (750 degrees C and 950 degrees C)
   experiments were performed for AM1 alloy solidified with a conventional
   radiation cooled (Bridgman) and higher thermal gradient liquid-metal
   cooled (LMC) casting process to produce coarse and finer-scaled
   dendritic structures, respectively. There was no significant effect of
   the casting technique on creep properties, due to the very similar
   microstructures (gamma'-size and gamma-channel width) established after
   full heat treatment of both Bridgman and LMC samples. For low cycle
   fatigue properties, the benefit of the higher gradient LMC process was
   dependent on the testing temperature. At 750 degrees C, cracks primarily
   initiated at pores created by solidification shrinkage in both Bridgman
   and LMC samples. Samples produced by the LMC technique demonstrated
   fatigue lives up to 4 times longer, compared to the Bridgman samples,
   due to refined porosity. At 950 degrees C the low cycle fatigue
   properties of the LMC and conventionally solidified material were not
   distinguishable due to a shift of crack initiation sites from internal
   pores to oxidized surface layers or near-surface pores. The benefit of
   the LMC approach was, however, apparent in fatigue at 950 degrees C when
   testing in a vacuum environment. Based on these results, a crack
   initiation model based on the local slip activity close to casting
   defect is proposed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Damage during cycling loading of polycrystalline metallic alloys
   involves localized plastic straining at the scale of individual grains.
   To better understand damage accumulation processes and to build models
   for material behavior there is a need for quantitative assessment of the
   heterogeneous strain fields at the grain and even more microscopic
   scales. In the present study, a digital image correlation (DIC) approach
   has been developed to measure the strains at the grain level and at
   finer scales where plastic strain localization is manifested as physical
   slip bands. Strain fields have been measured in situ and ex situ on a
   Rene 88DT polycrystalline nickel-based superalloy to assess the
   grain-scale deformation processes during monotonic straining in tension
   and compression. DIC analysis and transmission electron microscopy
   demonstrate that slip occurs in a highly localized manner. The highest
   localized strains developed in slip bands that formed on {1 1 1} planes
   parallel to, and slightly offset from, annealing twins. Enhanced local
   straining below yield was observed during compression loading. The
   degree of strain concentration caused by slip bands impinging on grain
   boundaries was also analyzed. The results are compared to predictions of

AB Selective laser melting (SLM), an additive manufacturing process, is

   processing techniques. In this paper, Inconel 625 alloy, a widely used
   material in the aerospace industry, were chosen as the build material.
   Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electron back scattering diffraction
   (EBSD) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis techniques were employed to
   analyze its microstructure. It was observed that the molten pool was
   composed of elongated columnar crystal. Due to the rapid cooling speed,
   the primary dendrite arm space was approximately 0.5 mu m and the
   hardness of SLM state was very high (343 HV). The inverse pole figure
   (IPF) indicated that the growing orientation of the most grains was <
   001 > due to the epitaxial growth and heat conduction. The XRD results
   revealed that the austenite structure with large lattice distortion was
   fully formed. No carbides or precipitated phases were found. After heat
   treatment the grains grew into two microstructures with distinct
   morphological characters, namely, rectangular grains and limited in the
   molten pool, and equiaxed grains along the molten boundaries. Upon
   experiencing the heat treatment, MC carbides with triangular shapes
   gradually precipitated. The results also identified that a large number
   of zigzag grain boundaries were formed. In this study, the grain
   formation and microstructure, and the laws of the molten pool evolution

   behavior for the subsolvus and supersolvus deformation were
   significantly related to the presence of gamma' precipitates. The
   relationship between gamma' precipitates and deformation conditions and
   the interaction between gamma' precipitates and grain boundaries (GBs)
   were presented. Multiple mechanisms of DRX nucleation were discussed in
   consideration of subgrain rotation, twinning and gamma' precipitates.
   Particular attention was paid to the role of intragranular DRX
   nucleation and continuous dynamic recrystallization (CDRX) nucleation.
