TI Processing of a single-crystalline CrCoNi medium-entropy alloy and
   evolution of its thermal expansion and elastic stiffness coefficients
   with temperature
SO SCRIPTA MATERIALIA
AB The equiatomic CrCoNi alloy is regarded as a model single-phase face-centered cubic medium-entropy alloy. A CrCoNi single crystal was grown by a Bridgman technique using a Ni-base superalloy seed. The elastic stiffnesses and thermal expansion coefficient were determined between 100 K and 673 K employing resonant ultrasound spectroscopy and dilatometry, respectively. All data were found to be in excellent agreement with those reported for polycrystalline CrCoNi. A comparison of the normalized Cauchy pressure of CrCoNi with those of other alloys indicates that interatomic bonds become more directional with increasing Cr-concentration while Co and Ni promote a metallic character.

TI Multi-phase ELAStic Aggregates (MELASA) software tool for modeling
   anisotropic elastic properties of lamellar composites
SO COMPUTER PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS
AB We introduce a new web-based tool called MELASA (Multi-phase ELAStic Aggregates), open-access available at https://melasa.cerit-sc.cz, for computations and visualizations of anisotropic elastic properties of lamellar (nano-)composites. MELASA implements a linear-elasticity method by Grimsditch and Nizzoli (1986), originally developed for superlattices of any symmetry. Our tool may be used for computation of anisotropic elastic properties of a specific type of periodically separated lamellar (nano-) composites using matrices of elastic stiffnesses of co-existing phases as an input. Elastic properties are visualized in the form of directional dependencies of selected elastic characteristics (Young's modulus and linear compressibility). MELASA further generalizes the Grimsditch-Nizzoli approach, which was originally formulated for only two phases, to multiple-phase composites. Additionally, our implementation allows for treating internal rotations of local coordination systems corresponding to the natural set of coordinates that match directional vectors of unit cell defining crystal lattice within the co-existing phases. Fe-Al-based superalloy nanocomposites are employed as a numerical example of superlattices with the input and output elastic stiffnesses determined by quantum-mechanical calculations. In particular, three different atomic configurations of interfaces in superlattices containing the ordered Fe-Al phase and a disordered Fe-Al phase with 18.75at.%Al (modeled by a special quasi-random structure, SQS) are considered. They differ by relative positions of sublattices in Fe-Al (an antiphase-like shift) and/or atomic planes in Fe-18.75at.%Al with respect to the interface (a circular/cyclic shift).

TI Numerical simulation of microstructure evolution in Ni-based superalloys
   during P-type rafting using multiphase-field model and crystal
   plasticity
SO COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB During the service process, Ni-based superalloys undergo microstructure evolutions such as rafting, which greatly affect its service performance. In the present study, a multiphase-field model coupled with crystal plasticity was established to simulate the gamma/gamma' microstructure evolution of Ni-based superalloys during P-type rafting. The anisotropic plasticity considering 12 octahedral slip systems was defined in gamma matrix channel. The PanNickel (c) database was used to calculate thermodynamic and kinetic data for phase transition and diffusion in multicomponent superalloys. First, the model was validated by two benchmarks with and without consideration of external load respectively. Then, the anisotropic of slip systems was analyzed. It was found that eight slip systems A2, A3, B2, B4, C1, C3, D1, D4 were activated in gable channel first when the structure was compressed in [0 0 1] direction. Besides, the elements distribution was studied. It can be seen that Al, Ti, Ta diffused into precipitates while Co, Cr and Mo diffused away the roof channel when the structure was compressed in [0 0 1] direction. Re and W mainly distributed in the gamma/gamma' interface because their slow diffusion rate. Finally, the P-type raft of CMSX-4 superalloy was simulated, and the plasticity distribution and plastic behavior of the 12 slip systems were discussed. The current model can be used to simulate phase transformation of multicomponent superalloys where plasticity is strongly coupled.

TI HRTEM analysis of the high-temperature phases of the newly developed
   high-temperature Ni-base superalloy VDM 780 Premium
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB VDM 780 Premium is a recently developed Ni-based superalloy designed for working at high service temperatures (above 650 degrees C) while keeping the good workability of alloy 718. VDM 780 Premium is based on the austenitic matrix (gamma phase) strengthened by intermetallic Ni3Al-like precipitates (gamma' phase, fcc L1(2) structure). Other co-precipitates may be formed in function of the applied heat treatment, such as Ni3Nb-based (delta phase, orthorhombic DOa structure) or Ni3Ti-based (eta phase, hexagonal DO24 structure) precipitates. The amount as well as the size and morphology of the different precipitates depend on the heat treatments performed on the alloy, playing an important role in improving the creep properties or the behavior during forging and recrystallization. This work contains a complex study using various techniques of analytical electron microscopy and synchrotron diffraction intended to clarify the structure of the high-temperature phase formed in the newly developed VDM 780 Premium alloy. The atomic structure of the high-temperature plate-like precipitates formed in VDM 780 Premium after two different thermal treatments has been investigated in relation with the surrounding matrix lattice, proving the stacked delta/eta structure of the precipitates.

TI Improvement of the high temperature oxidation of TaC-strengthened
   Co(Cr)-based cast superalloys by the addition of nickel
SO CORROSION ENGINEERING SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB In this work, nickel is added in substitution to cobalt in the composition of a cast cobalt-based chromium-rich superalloy designed to obtain a double-phased {fcc matrix + TaC} microstructure. Two nickel amounts were tested, 13 and 26 wt-%Ni, for 25 wt-%Cr, 0.4 wt-%C and 6 wt-%Ta, the rest being cobalt. The obtained as-cast microstructures are not different from the starting alloy's one, contrarily to the hardness which became lower. The oxidation tests at 1200 degrees C for 170 h demonstrated a significant improvement of the alloy's behaviour, especially for an addition of 26 wt-%Ni. This seems to be attributed to an easier Cr diffusion towards the oxidation front as suggested by the observed Cr contents in extreme surface as well as by the lower Cr concentration gradients. In addition, the TaC seemed to be morphologically more stable in the presence of nickel in the alloys than in the absence of Ni.

TI Microstructural evolution of the heat affected zone of a Co-Ti-W alloy
   upon laser cladding with a CoNiCrAlY coating
SO MATERIALS CHARACTERIZATION
AB We report on the microstructural evolution of the heat affected zone of a gamma/gamma'-strengthened Co-Ti-W alloy upon laser cladding with a CoNiCrAlY coating. Using electron microscopy and atom probe tomography we observed two distinct heat affect zones, namely gamma islands containing gamma' precipitate (similar to 45 nm in size) colonies and heat affected gamma/gamma' regions outside the gamma islands comprising fine gamma' precipitates (similar to 25 nm in size). Based on the experimental data and thermodynamic calculations, we propose a model for the formation of these two heat affected zones and discuss the differences in the observed precipitate sizes.

TI Part geometry and conduction-based laser power control for powder bed
   fusion additive manufacturing
SO ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING
AB Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) uses a focused, high power laser to repeatedly scan geometric patterns on thin layers of metal powder, which build up to a final, solid three-dimensional (3D) part. This process is somewhat limited in that the parts tend to have poorer surface finish (compared to machining or grinding) and distortion due to residual stress, as well as multiple other deficiencies. Typical laser scan strategies are relatively simple and use constant laser power levels. This elicits local variations in the melt pool size, shape, or temperature, particularly near sharp geometric features or overhang structures due to the relatively higher thermal conductivity of solid metal compared to metal powder. In this paper, we present a new laser power control algorithm, which scales the laser power to a value called the geometric conductance factor (GCF). The GCF is calculated based on the amount of solid vs. powder material near the melt pool. The algorithm for calculating GCF is presented along with some basic examples for clarification. Then, we detail the hardware and software implementation on the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) additive manufacturing metrology testbed (AMMT), which includes co-axial melt pool monitoring using a high-speed camera. Six parts were fabricated out of nickel superalloy 625 (IN625) with the same nominal laser power, but with varying GCF algorithm parameters. We demonstrate the effect of tailored laser power on reducing the variability of melt pool intensity measured throughout the 3D build. Finally, we contrast the difference between the 'optimized' part vs. the standard build parameters, including the deflection of the final part top surface near the overhang and the variation of surface finish on the down-facing surfaces. Ultimately, the improvements to the in-situ process monitoring and part qualities demonstrate the utility and future potential tuning and optimizing more complex laser scan strategies.

TI Microstructure and mechanical behavior at elevated temperatures of a
   novel nickel base superalloy heavily alloyed with forming and
   substitution elements
SO LETTERS ON MATERIALS
AB A novel nickel base superalloy heavily alloyed with gamma' forming and substitution elements, particularly with rhenium and tungsten, has been proposed in the present work as a potential die material for die forging of the most hard-to-deform nickel base superalloys. The superalloy composition is Ni-13(Al, Ti, Nb, Ta)-27(Cr, Co, Mo, W, Re, Si, C, B) (wt.%). The superalloy ingot was manufactured by vacuum induction melting. Microstructure examination showed that the as-cast condition was characterized by a coarse grained dendritic structure consisted of coarse gamma grains containing gamma' precipitates with a size 0.3 -1 mu m and primary gamma' particles with a size 5 -100 mu m. A small amount of carbides and topologically close packed (TCP) phases was also detected. The microstructure examination suggests that the general solidification pathway was L ->gamma ->gamma', as it is in nickel base superalloys. At the same time, the primary gamma' particles were probably formed via the peritectic reaction L-noneq + gamma ->gamma', where L-noneq is the nonequilibrium liquid, which was retained at the peritectic temperature. The superalloy was subjected to heat treatment including solid solution treatment and ageing. The heat treatment led to coagulation of the primary gamma' phase and to a slight decrease in the volume fractions of carbides and TCP phases. The heat treated condition was used to prepare samples for compression tests, which were performed at 900-1200 degrees C up to the true strain e= 0.1. The yield strength of the novel superalloy was generally appreciably higher as compared with those of known nickel base superalloys and alloys based on the Ni3Al intermetallic phase.

TI Identifying heating rate dependent oxidation reactions on a nickel-based
   superalloy using synchrotron diffraction
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB Synchrotron grazing incidence X-ray diffraction has been used to newly reveal the heating rate dependent oxidation reactions that develop on a polycrystalline nickel-based superalloy. A continuous layer of precursor oxide was shown to form during the heating stage. Their approximate growth rates, their effect on local surface compositions of the alloy substrate, and their degree of interface planarity are considered critical in determining subsequent oxidation reactions when held for extended thermal exposures. The precursor oxides were predominantly nickel or cobalt based (NiO/CoO and Co3O4/NiCo2O4). Following the fastest heating rates (40 degrees C min(-1) and above), the stable Cr2O3 phase formed, inhibiting Ni or Co diffusion to the surface. At slower heating rates (10-20 degrees C min(-1)), no evidence of the stable Cr2O3 was found, even after 200 h at elevated thermal exposure, instead continued growth of the precursor oxides was observed. Heating at 5 degrees C min(-1) gave rise to an intriguing zone where sufficient precursor and favourable kinetics enabled the formation of a spinel, NiCr2O4, surface layer. Cross sections observed with electron microscopy confirmed this to be planar and continuous. Heating at the slowest tested 2 degrees C min(-1) contrarily gives a non-protective surface layer comprising an outwardly growing NiO/CoO precursor oxide on top of an inwardly growing mixed oxide. The quantities, interfacial morphologies of oxides of the precursor oxide grown and the possible thermodynamic reactions that lead to their formation are discussed.

TI High temperature oxidation behavior of electron beam smelted K417
   superalloy
SO VACUUM
AB The high temperature oxidation behavior of electron beam smelted K417 superalloy were investigated at 800 degrees C, 900 degrees C and 1000 degrees C. The results showed that the oxidation resistance of the K417 superalloy is improved after electron beam smelting due to its resulting large grain-boundary density and low impurity content. The secondary dendrite arm spacing of K417 after electron beam smelting is approximately 42.9 mu m, which is finer than that approximately 100.0 mu m of the raw material. The O and N element contents were reduced by 50% and 67%, respectively. The oxidation kinetics were controlled by the oxidation reaction of Cr and Ti in the early stage, and subsequently it was determined by the oxidation behavior of Al. The oxide film consisted of three layers: an external layer composed of TiO2, Cr2O(3), Al2O3 and a small amount of (Ni,Co) Cr2O4; a middle layer that included TiO2, Cr2O(3), Al2O3 and trace amounts of TIVO4; and an inner layer that contained Al2O3 exclusively. An oxidation mechanism of the K417 superalloy is proposed that involves the diffusion of metal ions and O-2-at elevated temperatures.

SO INTERMETALLICS
AB Three compositions of Re containing Co-Ti-based alloys with gamma/gamma' two-phase microstructure were obtained based on the determined phase relationship in the Co-rich corner at 800 degrees C. The effect of Re on microstructure, elemental partition behavior, thermodynamic properties, lattice parameter misfits, mechanical properties and gamma' coarsening behavior of the Co-Ti-Re alloys were investigated. The gamma/gamma' lattice parameter misfit of the alloys decreases from 0.72% to 0.50%, and the gamma' coarsening rate constant K of alloys decreases from 0.30 x 10(-27) m(3) s(-1) to 0.073 x 10(-27) m(3) s(-1) as Re content increasing form 1 at. % to 5 at. %. Additionally, the volume fraction of gamma' phase (V-gamma') increases from 42.15% to 53.19% and the gamma' solvus temperature increases from 1059 degrees C to 1085 degrees C (Tsolvus-gamma') with increasing Re content. Moreover, the 0.2% flow stresses and the 0.2% specific flow stresses of all three alloys exhibit negative temperature dependence at the temperatures ranging from room temperature to 900 degrees C. And both the 0.2% flow stresses and the 0.2% specific flow stresses increase with the Re content.

The alloy shows low corrosion resistance. Its oxide scale spalls off readily and includes porous NiO outer layer and NiCr(Al)(2)O-4 inner one. The nanocrystalline coating performs better. Its oxide scale consists of Al2O3, NiO and Ta2O5. Chlorination and/or oxidation of Ta ruined compactness of scale. The yttrium modified nanocrystalline coating provides the highest corrosion resistance. Its scale is exclusively alumina. Yttrium inhibits the outward diffusion of Ta.

TI The Element Segregation Between gamma/gamma MODIFIER LETTER PRIME Phases
   in a Ni-Based Single Crystal Superalloy Studied by 3D-APT and Its
   Potential Impact on Local Interfacial Misfit Strain
SO METALS AND MATERIALS INTERNATIONAL
AB Three-dimensional atom-probe tomography was used to characterize the gamma/gamma MODIFIER LETTER PRIME interface structure in a third-generation Ni-based single crystal superalloy with Re addition. It was found that an element-segregation layer with Re, Co and Cr was formed in the gamma phase close to the gamma/gamma ' interface, resulting in a more negative local interface misfit (- 0.29%) compared to the measured result (- 0.16%) from high-resolution X-ray diffraction. Furthermore, the total reduction of interfacial free energy due to the solute atom segregation based on the Gibbsian interfacial excess was calculated to indicate that Re element was the most beneficial element in producing this more negative local misfit with the largest interfacial free energy reduction (13.67 +/- 0.21 mJ/m(2)). Simultaneously, because of the co-segregation of Re, Co and Cr, and the depletion of Ni in the gamma phase close to the gamma/gamma ' interface, it was also deduced that some harmful topologically close-packed phases might be easier to nucleate and grow in the gamma phase close to the gamma/gamma ' interface in service. Graphic The element-segregation layer across gamma/gamma ' interface resulted in a more negative local interface misfit (- 0.29%), compared to the measured result (- 0.16%) from highresolution X-ray diffraction, and the total reduction of interfacial free energy due to the solute atom segregation was calculated to indicate that Re element was the most beneficial element in producing this more negative local misfit with the largest interfacial free energy reduction (13.67 +/- 0.21 mJ/m(2)).

This alloy is a constituent of alloying elements such as Cr, Co, and Mo, it also acts as solid solution strengtheners. The elements Mo and Cr segregation are prone to cracking tendency in this alloy. The current work investigates the mechanical and metallurgical behavior of the weldments produced by four different filler metals. The weldments were made by using Continuous current Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (CGTAW) technique with ERNiCrCoMo-1, ERNiCrMo-10, ERNiCrMo-4, and ERNiCrMo-14 filler metals. The existence of columnar and cellular structures in the weld zone was observed through microstructural inspection. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) confirmed the secondary phase existence in the subgrain boundaries region (SGBR) of all the weldments. Through Electron Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) examination Cr-rich phases were observed in ERNiCrCoMo-1 filler metal and Mo- rich phases in other filler metals (ERNiCrMo-10, ERNiCrMo-4, and ERNiCrMo-14). Weldment produced by ERNiCrCoMo-1 filler metal shows marginally higher tensile strength compared to the other weld joints. Ductile mode of failure was observed through SEM fractography for all the weldments. Results of bend test didn't show any crack in the surface regions.

TI Identification of Laves phases in a Zr or Hf containing gamma-gamma'
   Co-base superalloy
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB ZrCo2 and HfCo2 Laves phases were found and characterized in gamma-gamma' Co-base superalloys using high-energy X-ray diffraction, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy. They formed during casting and are stable during long-term annealing at 900 degrees C. The ZrCo2 phase with a cubic MgCu2-type structure exhibits numerous nano-twins and stacking faults, while HfCo2 has a hexagonal MgNi2-type structure instead of MgCu2-type in contrast to literature. Their chemical compositions strongly deviated from stoichiometry and significant amounts of Al and Ware contained in these phases. These could affect the atomic radius ratio and valence electron concentration and thus change the structure of the Laves phases. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Effect of Pre-Oxidation on High Temperature Oxidation and Corrosion
   Behavior of Co-Al-W-Based Superalloy
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB In 2006, stable gamma' phase was found in Co-Al-W alloy, which provides a new way for developing Co-based superalloys. In order to meet the requirements for applications, the Co-Al-W-based superalloys need to have good oxidation and corrosion resistance. But the oxidation and corrosion resistance of the Co-Al-W-based superalloys is relatively low. In this work, pre-oxidation treatments were to improve the oxidation and corrosion resistance. Three types of pre-oxidation treatments were carried out at 900 degrees C (in air), 950 degrees C (in air) and 1000 degrees C (in 1%O-2 +99%Ar), which were marked as 900-PreO, 950-PreO and 1000-LPreO, respectively. High temperature oxidation tests of both the pre-oxidation treated and untreated superalloys were carried out at 1000 degrees C. And hot corrosion behaviors were also investigated at both 800 and 850 degrees C. XRD, SEM and EDS were used to examine the characteristics of the oxidation and corrosion behaviors. The results show that the pre-oxide layers of the superalloys after different pre-oxidation treatments are compact. During oxidation at 1000 degrees C, the Cr2O3 scale in 900-PreO treated superalloy is oxidized to form volatile products, and the diffusion resistance of both oxygen and the metal elements through the oxide layer is poor. In 1000-LPreO treated superalloy, serious spallation of the oxides occurs and leads to poor oxidation resistance. In 950-PreO treated superalloy, since the continuous CoCr2O4 and Al2O3 scales help to reduce the diffusion of oxygen and the metal elements, the mass gain of 950-PreO treated superalloy is consequently decreased. During the hot corrosion process, the preoxide layer of 950-PreO treated superalloy can hinder the diffusion of corrosive medium. Therefore, the corrosion resistance can be significantly improved by 950-PreO treatment, and the mass gain is decreased by over 80%.

TI On the Development Concept for a New 718-Type Superalloy with Improved
   Temperature Capability
SO METALS
AB The superalloy 718 stands out for its excellent manufacturability and strength at ambient temperature. However, its application temperature is limited to about 650 degrees C due to the instability of the gamma '' precipitates. Here, we provide an in-depth account of an alloy development concept, allowing for the design of superalloys with 718-type properties, yet with a significantly improved microstructural stability. The article begins with a detailed discussion on how the microstructural and chemical composition must be altered to achieve this objective. Then, model alloys were used to explore and validate the outlined strategy. Finally, it is shown how these considerations ultimately led to a new 718-type superalloy with far more improved microstructural stability-namely, VDM Alloy 780. The introduction of a large amount of Co as a substitute for Fe (and partially Ni) is the most important element of our alloy development concept in terms of chemical composition. The most important microstructural feature is the introduction of low solvus temperature, high misfit gamma'-strengthening, replacing gamma ''-hardening.

TI Element Segregation and Solidification Behavior of a Nb, Ti, Al
   Co-Strengthened Superalloy & x42d;K151
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA-ENGLISH LETTERS
AB The as-cast microstructure, element segregation and solidification behavior of a multi-alloyed superalloy & x42d;K151 have been investigated. The results show that the severe element segregation leads to the complicated precipitations at the inter-dendritic region, including eta-Ni-3(Ti, Nb), eutectic (gamma + gamma ') and Laves, which shows the characteristics of both Ti, Al-strengthened and Nb-strengthened alloys. Differential thermal analysis, heating and quenching tests reveal the solidification sequence as follows: Liquids -> gamma matrix -> (Nb, Ti)C -> eta-Ni-3(Ti, Nb) -> eutectic (gamma + gamma ') -> Laves. The melting points are between 1250 and 1260 degrees C for (Nb, Ti)C, between 1200 and 1210 degrees C for eta phase, between 1180 and 1190 degrees C for eutectic (gamma + gamma ') and Laves. gamma ' initially precipitates from matrix at 1150 degrees C and achieves the maximum precipitation at 1130 degrees C. According to the microstructure evolution captured during solidification and composition analysis by an energy dispersive spectrometer and electron probe microanalyzer, (Nb, Ti)/Al ratio is put forward to explain the formation of eta-Ni-3(Ti, Nb) and eutectic (gamma + gamma '). The solidification of gamma matrix increased the Nb, Ti concentration in the residual liquids, so the high (Nb, Ti)/Al ratio would result in the formation of eta-Ni-3(Ti, Nb); the precipitation of the phase consumed Nb and Ti and decreased the (Nb, Ti)/Al ratio in the liquid, which led to the precipitation of eutectic (gamma + gamma '). Laves formed by the sides of eta-Ni-3(Ti, Nb) and in front of the eutectic (gamma + gamma ') after Al, Ti were further depleted by the two phases and Cr, Co, Mo were rejected to liquids.

TI On the high temperature coarsening kinetics of gamma ' precipitates in a
   high strength Co37.6Ni35.4Al9.9Mo4.9Cr5.9Ta2.8Ti3.5 fcc-based high
   entropy alloy
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB The paper reports evolution of two-phase microstructure quantitatively in a high entropy alloy of composition Co37.6Ni35.4Al9.9Mo4.9Ta2.8Ti3.5. A very high-volume fraction of ordered L1(2) precipitates forms below its solvus temperature of 1156 degrees C that cannot be suppressed during quenching. The quench microstructure contains nanometric bimodal size distribution of spheroidal and irregular precipitates, both having L1(2) ordering (gamma') and a Co + Ni concentration close to 75 at. %, thus representing a stoichiometry of (Ni,Co)(3) (AI,Cr,Ta,Ti,Mo). The alloy shows hardening on aging with a peak in hardness value at 900 degrees C for 50 h of annealing. The morphology of the precipitates at this stage evolves into cuboidal shape having rounded corners with a lattice mismatch of +0.22% with the matrix. A detailed study of the coarsening behaviour of these precipitates in the matrix of complex solid solution indicates that the coarsening follows a modified LSW mechanism with estimated activation energy of 360 +/- 50 kJ/mol between 900 and 1000 degrees C. This is slightly higher than the activation energy of most of the solutes in gamma Co matrix that does not contain heavy elements like W or Re. The high-volume fraction of the precipitates together with coarsening resistance lead to an attractive high temperature strength that is higher than many of the known superalloys.

TI Hot deformation behavior and DRX mechanism in a gamma-gamma '
   cobalt-based superalloy
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB gamma-gamma'cobalt-based superalloys have been the main focus of attention as a new class of high temperature materials. The present research studies the hot deformation, microstructure evolution, and dynamic recrystallization (DRX) mechanisms of a cast Co-Al-W superalloy during the hot compression process. The microstructure of the starting material is constituted of large MC carbide particles within a coarse grain structure. Two hot deformation regimes, i.e., low temperature (950 degrees C-1050 degrees C) and high temperature (1100 degrees C-1200 degrees C) were designed and performed. Flow curve and constitutive analysis using a hyperbolic sine equation evidenced two distinct behaviors among the regimes. Microstructural evaluation revealed a large volume fraction of fine gamma'particles with radius less than 100 nm, precipitated during heating and isothermal holding, which precluded DRX in the low temperature regime. In the high temperature regime, new grains were formed through a special discontinuous DRX at three different regions in the microstructure: original grain boundaries, vicinity of MC carbides and the interior of the relatively coarse grains; these may be attributed to the mechanisms of SIBM, PSN and sub-grain growth, respectively. A conceptual descriptive model for the especial DRX phenomenon was proposed.

TI Microstructure and Mechanical Performance of the DD98M-DD98M Single
   Crystal Superalloy Joints Brazed Using a Pd-Si Composite Filler
SO METALS
AB In this work, the DD98M single crystal superalloys were brazed to themselves using a Pd-Si composite filler. The effect of brazing temperature and soaking time on the microstructure and mechanical behavior of the joints was studied. The microstructure and phase constitution in the joint were identified by the SEM and EDS analysis. The results indicated that the joint obtained was constituted by DD98M/zone 2/zone 1/zone 2/DD98M. The zone 1 was primarily made up of the Ni (Pd, Cr, Co) (s.s), Pd4Si, Pd (Ni, Ti, Al) (s.s) and Pd-rich Ni (Pd, Cr, Co) (s.s), while the zone 2 consisted of the Ni (Pd, Cr, Co) (s.s) and Al2Pd5. During the brazing process, increasing the brazing temperature strengthened the fluidity of the liquid filler, which was favorable to eliminating the solidified pores in the brazing seam. Furthermore, a higher brazing temperature would cause the phases in the zones 1 and 2 to be coarsened remarkably. When setting the brazing temperature to 1060 degrees C, extending the soaking time made the amount of Pd (Ni, Ti, Al) (s.s) decrease, whereas the amount of Pd4Si increased, because the peritectic reaction between the Pd (Ni, Ti, Al) (s.s) and remnant liquid filler was enhanced. Among the brazing process parameters under investigation, the maximum joint average shear strength obtained reached 338 MPa when the joint was brazed at 1060 degrees C for 30 min. A ductile fracture mode happened during the shear tests under a joining condition. The work performed can provide valuable data to design the single crystal superalloy brazed joint.

TI High temperature oxidation behaviour of gamma '-strengthened Co-based
   superalloys with different Ni addition
SO CORROSION SCIENCE
AB High temperature oxidation behaviours of gamma'-strengthened Co-based superalloys with various Ni additions were investigated at both 800 degrees C and 900 degrees C. The results show that the superalloys show excellent oxidation resistance due to the formation of compact spinel oxide scales. With the increasing of Ni addition, the concentration of Cr in scale/alloy interface will be increased but that of Co will be decreased. And the growth of Cr2O3 will be promoted, while CoO nucleation will be hindered. Therefore, increasing Ni addition helps the formation of protective spinel oxide scales and delays nodular oxidation, which favours to be better oxidation resistance.

TI Combined phase-field crystal plasticity simulation of P- and N-type
   rafting in Co-based superalloys
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB We combine a phase-field model with a crystal plasticity model to simulate the microstructural evolution during creep in the Co-based superalloy ERBOCo-2Ta. Three-dimensional simulations of tensile and compressive creep tests in [100] direction were performed to study the rafting behavior in Co-based superalloys. The loss of coherency between gamma matrix and gamma' precipitate, which is essential for the understanding of rafted structures, is modeled in relation to the dislocation activity in the gamma-channels. Special attention is given to the interplay between creep deformation and microstructure stability. Appropriate constitutive modeling is applied to simulate realistic microstructure evolution under creep conditions. Thus, with the removal of the misfit stress, gamma' precipitates lose their cuboidal shape and form rafts. During N-type rafting more gamma' precipitates coalesce than during P-type rafting. The gamma' volume fraction during rafting increases under tensile stress but decreases under compressive stress. The morphological evolution of gamma' precipitates under tensile and compressive stresses in Co-based superalloy is consistent with the rafting characteristics in experimental observations.

SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB We characterized the microstructural features and mechanical performance of a model Co-5.6Al-5.8W-6.6Ti-0.12B (at.%) alloy consisting of gamma(L1(2))-precipitates in a gamma(f.c.c.)-matrix. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to follow the isothermal aging of the micro-structure at 900 and 1000 degrees C for 256 h, and 950 degrees C for 1000 h. The compositions of the gamma'(L1(2))-precipitates and gamma(f.c.c.)-matrix were evaluated by atom-probe tomography (APT) for solution-treated and air-cooled conditions, as well as in specimens aged at 950 degrees C for 16 and 100 h. Boron was shown to partition preferentially to the gamma'(L1(2))-precipitates, and profiles taken across the gamma(f.c.c.)-matrix channels in both aged specimens revealed confined segregation of A1 at one of the two gamma(f.c.c.)/gamma'(L1(2)) heterophase interfaces. After aging at 950 degrees C for 16 h, Co-5.6Al-5.8W-6.6Ti-0.12B (at.%) exhibited anomalous flow-strength behavior in the range 625-900 degrees C with a peak yield stress of 822 MPa between 800 and 825 degrees C. Compressive creep tests performed at 850 degrees C demonstrated a creep strength comparable to archival literature results for Co-9Al-9W-0.12B (at.%), despite a smaller gamma'(L1(2))-volume fraction and lack of strengthening borides along the grain boundaries (GBs). The activation energy for creep in the temperature range 800-900 degrees C was 606 kJ mol(-1). The post-creep microstructure consists of rafted gamma'(L1(2))-precipitates perpendicular to the compression axis, consistent with the positive gamma(f.c.c.)/gamma'(L1(2)) lattice parameter misfit character of this class of alloys. Creep failure could occur due to GB embrittlement caused by deleterious Ti-rich (L2(1) or B2) and D0(19) phases formed at the GBs during creep. (C) 2019 Acta Materialia Inc.

TI Microstructural evolution and compression property of a novel gamma
   '-strengthened directionally solidified CoNi-base superalloy
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB The microstructural evolution and compression property of a novel gamma'-strengthened CoNi-base superalloy have been investigated. The directionally solidified CoNi-base superalloy possesses a lower density of 9.03 g/cm(3) and a higher gamma' solvus temperature of 1166 degrees C, compared with those of the Co-Al-W-base superalloys with high level of W element. After aging at 900-1100 degrees C, the alloy displays stable gamma/gamma' two-phase microstructure with high volume fraction of the gamma' phase, and without detrimental topologically close-packed (TCP) phase. The CoNi-base superalloy shows good compression property. In the process of compression, the alloy exhibits positive temperature dependence of the 0.2% flow stress above 600 degrees C. With increasing temperature, the alloy displays a maximum of 0.2% flow stress of 607 MPa at 850 degrees C. The major deformation mechanisms of the CoNi-base alloy are pairs of a/2 < 110 > -type dislocations shearing gamma' precipitates from room temperature to 850 degrees C and unpaired dislocations bypassing the gamma' precipitates above the peak temperature of 850 degrees C. In this alloy, high content of Ni improves the gamma' solvus temperature and microstructural stability, which leads to a good compression property at high temperatures.

TI Strain controlled isothermal low cycle fatigue life, deformation and
   fracture characteristics of Superni 263 superalloy
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB The total axial strain controlled low-cycle fatigue (LCF) behaviour of a wrought nickel-base superalloy Superni 263 has been evaluated at 298 K, 673 K, and 923 K employing the strain amplitudes in the range +/- 0.25% to +/- 0.80%. All the tests were performed using a triangular wave form at a constant strain rate of 10(-3) s(-1). The Superni 263 alloy was subjected to a solutionizing treatment at 1373 K/1.5 h followed by water quenching. An ageing treatment of 1073 K/8 h was given to the solutionized samples. The microstructure of the alloy is composed of gamma' in the intragranular regions and discrete M23C6 precipitates on the grain boundaries. Few undissolved (Ti, Mo)C and TiN precipitates were also noticed in the matrix. The strain amplitude and temperature played a significant role in the evolution of macroscopic cyclic stress response and the development of deformation substructure. The alloy displayed serrated flow in the plastic portions of stress-strain hysteresis loops in the tests conducted at 673 K and 923 K, predominantly at strain amplitudes higher than +/- 0.40%. Several manifestations depicting the occurrence of dynamic strain ageing (DSA) were derived by analysing both the macroscopic and micro-mechanistic information generated. The comparative evaluation of monotonic and cyclic stress-strain curves was conducted and the factors responsible for rapid cyclic hardening during DSA were identified. The fatigue life decreased drastically with increasing temperature, particularly at low strain amplitudes. The strain life data could be represented well by using Basquin and Coffin-Manson relationships. The slope in Coffin-Manson relationship revealed more negative values under the influence of DSA. The crack initiation and propagation modes at all the test conditions remained transgranular without the indications of interference from creep and oxidation effects. The deformation substructure at elevated temperatures was characterized by the occurrence of co-planar slip, stacking faults, micro twinning and high dislocation density in between the slip bands.

TI Co-growing mechanism of gamma/gamma ' eutectic on MC-type carbide in
   Ni-based single crystal superalloys
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB To clarify and comprehend the co-growing mechanism of gamma/gamma' eutectic on MC-type carbide in a single crystal CM247LC superalloy, the interface and the elements' segregation between MC-type carbide and gamma/gamma' eutectic was investigated in this paper. The results show that a semi-coherent boundary was observed having an orientation relationship of {(11) over bar1}(MC) parallel to {(11) over bar1}(gamma/gamma') with < 011>(MC) parallel to < 011>(gamma/gamma'). This interface structure resulted in a high interface energy, and a reduced preference of gamma/gamma' eutectic's nucleation on MC-type carbide. However, this unfavorable interfacial feature was offset by the elements' segregation profile during the MC-type carbide's solidification, which is characterized by Al, Ni, Co and Cr enrichment and a co-growing mode.

TI Facilitating effect of interfacial grooves on the rafting of
   nickel-based single crystal superalloy at high temperature
SO SCRIPTA MATERIALIA
AB Interfacial grooving induced by dislocation stress takes place at gamma/gamma' interfaces during creep and aging of a third-generation nickel-based single crystal superalloy at 1120 degrees C. At the tip of grooves, gamma' phase is directly measured under compressive stress of interfacial dislocations, which likely drives the gamma'-forming elements out. The enrichment of Re and Co elements are detected in the tip. Meanwhile, gamma' precipitates coarsen much faster when more grooves form at the interfaces along the coarsening direction. This suggests that interfacial grooves facilitate the rafting of gamma' precipitates, especially under the creep stress. (C) 2019 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI HRTEM and nanoindentation analysis of NiCoCrAlHfYSi and NiCoCrAlTaY
   coatings produced by AC-HVAF and APS
SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB In this work, feedstock powders of NiCoCrAlHfYSi (Amdry386) and NiCoCrAlTaY (Amdry997) were deposited by atmospheric plasma spray (APS) and activated combustion high velocity air fuel (AC-HVAF), respectively. The research results show that the surface roughness of the HVAF386 and HVAF997 specimens increased considerably compared to the APS386 and APS997 specimens. The oxide contents decreased significantly in the two AC-HVAF specimens, and the pores and non-bonded interfaces are not easily observed. Additionally, the microstructures of the two feedstock powders were influenced significantly by the AC-HVAF and APS processes during coating deposition. Furthermore, the details of the microstructural characteristics of the four as-sprayed coatings were characterized by the HRTEM method, and various strengthening mechanisms of them were proposed. The strengthening of the APS386 specimen experienced sharp increase induced by the formation of twinning, whereas the strengthening mechanism of the APS997 specimen was likely due to presence of the superlattice second-phases distributed throughout the matrix gamma phase. Meanwhile, the elastic moduli and microhardness of the HVAF386 and HVAF997 specimens were enhanced significantly, suggesting the presence of stacking faults in the gamma-matrix phase and the gamma'-Ni3Al and beta-(Ni,Co)Al precipitates at the boundaries of gamma-(Ni,Co) grains, especially nano-precipitates in the HVAF386 specimen.

TI Effect of Al, Ti and Cr additions on the gamma-gamma' microstructure of
   W-free Co-Ta-V-Based superalloys
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB The recently-discovered metastable gamma'-Co-3(Ta0.76V0.24) phase formed on aging in a Co-6Ta-6V (at.%) ternary alloy is stabilized by partial replacement of Ta and V with Al and Ti. In two alloys with composition Co-6Al-3Ta-3V and Co-5Al-3Ta-3V-1Ti with gamma+gamma' microstructure, the gamma'-precipitates remain stable for up to 168 h at 850 and 900 C, with no precipitation of additional phases. Adding Ni and B and doubling the Ti concentration produces a gamma/gamma' superalloy, Co-10Ni-5Al-3Ta-3V-2Ti-0.04B (at.%), with gamma' precipitates which are stable up to six weeks of aging at 850 degrees C, while slowly coarsening and coalescing from cuboidal to elongated shapes. After one day of aging at 850 degrees C, the gamma' nanoprecipitates have a (Co0.83Ni0.17)(3)(Ta0.42Al0.23Ti0.19V0.15B0.01) composition, with Al and Ti replacing at the same rate both Ta and V in the original metastable Co-3(Ta0.76V0.24) phase. To improve oxidation resistance, 4% Cr is added to the new superalloy, resulting in a somewhat higher volume fraction of finer cuboidal gamma' precipitates after one week of aging at 850 degrees C, but no other deleterious phases. These W-and Mo-free gamma/gamma' superalloys show good creep resistance at 850 degrees C, on par with two other recent Co-base gamma/gamma' superalloys: (i) Co-9W-9Al-8Cr (at.%) which has higher density due to its high W content, and (ii) Co-30Ni-10Al-5Mo-2Nb (at.%) which has lower density (as it is W-free) but contains triple the Ni concentration.

TI Simulating the effect of aluminizing on a CoNiCrAlY-coated Ni-base
   superalloy
SO CALPHAD-COMPUTER COUPLING OF PHASE DIAGRAMS AND THERMOCHEMISTRY
AB MCrAlY (M = Ni, Co) coatings are commonly used on gas-turbine components as oxidation resistant overlay coatings and bondcoats for thermal barrier systems. The present work focuses on the effect of the aluminizing process on the CoNiCrAIY coating microstructure. In the as-received condition the outer part of the coating consisted mostly of beta-(Ni,Co)AI with interspersed precipitates of Cr-rich carbide and Cr-rich boride precipitates. Formation of sigma-CoCr was observed at the interface between the beta-layer and the inner initial CoNiCrAlY microstructure. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) combined with energy and wavelength-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX/WDX) was employed to characterize the aluminized CoNiCrAIY coating. Phases were then identified by electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD). Detailed microstructural studies of the coating were corroborated with the help of coupled thermodynamic-kinetic calculations to model the aluminizing process. The calculations were performed with the in-house developed code employing the commercially available thermodynamic and kinetic databases (ThermoCalc). The mechanisms of the observed microstructural changes were elucidated with the help of the modelling results.

TI High-strength Co-Al-V-base superalloys strengthened by gamma
   '-Co-3(Al,V) with high solvus temperature
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB The gamma/gamma' two-phase Co Al V-base superalloys are investigated in detail, including their phase equilibria, alloying effects, and alloy design. The experimental proof of the existence of a ternary compound with an L1(2)-ordered gamma'-Co-3(Al, V) phase is provided in this study, and the gamma/gamma' two-phase Co-5Al-14V (at.%) alloy is designed. The gamma'-Co-3(Al,V) phase is proved to be thermodynamically stable at 900 degrees C, and a wide gamma/gamma' two-phase composition region in the Co-Al-V ternary phase diagram at 900 degrees C is identified. The performed investigation of Co-5Al-14V-2X (X: Ti, Cr, Nb, Mo, Ta, and W) and Co-xNi-8Al-12V (x = 10, 20, and 30) quaternary alloys revealed that Ti, Nb, Mo, Ta, W, and Ni tend to concentrate in the gamma' phase, whereas Cr tends to partition to the gamma matrix. Besides, the gamma/gamma' two-phase Co-30Ni-10Al-5V-4Ta-2Ti (30Ni4Ta2Ti) alloy is designed. The 30Ni4Ta2Ti alloy exhibits a very high gamma' solvus temperature (namely, 1242 +/- 3 degrees C) combined with a low density (8.46 +/- 0.08 g cm(-3)), which characteristics are comparable with those of the Mar-M-247 Ni-base superalloy. Moreover, the nominal and the specific yield strength values of the obtained 30Ni4Ta2Ti alloy within the temperature range from 600 to 900 degrees C are also close to those of the Mar-M-247 superalloy.

TI Isothermal section of Ga-Co-Cu phase diagram at 830 degrees C and its
   peculiarities
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Recently, the Ga-based ternary alloys have gained interest for the possibility of finding new quasicrystals. Inspired by the previously reported decagonal and icosahedral quasicrystals identified in the Ga50Co25Cu25 alloy at 830 degrees C, the phase equilibria of 27 alloys of various composition were investigated in this work. Based on the obtained results, an isothermal section of the Ga-Co-Cu phase diagram at 830 degrees C was proposed. However, neither decagonal nor icosahedral quasicrystals were found to be stable at 830 degrees C, but instead of that, a superalloy-like structure was found in the Ga35Co25Cu40 alloy consisting of beta-GaCo and beta-GaCug-GaCu.

TI Microstructure and High Temperature Wear Resistance of TiC/Inconel 718
   Composites In-situ Synthesized by Plasma Melting Deposition Technique
SO RARE METAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING
AB In order to modify the high temperature wear resistance of Inconel 718 superalloy, TiC reinforced Inconel 718 superalloy based composites were in-situ synthesized by co-axial powder feeding plasma melting deposition technique. Microstructure and in-situ synthesis process of the composites was analyzed. The effect of volume fraction of the TiC reinforcing phase on microhardness and high temperature dry sliding wear properties of composites was discussed. The high temperature wear mechanism of the composites was also studied. Results show that the microstructure of composites is refined and dense. Microhardness values are remarkably influenced by the volume fraction of the TiC primary phase. The higher the volume fraction of the TiC primary phase, the higher the microhardness values of the composites. The composites exhibit excellent wear resistance under high temperature dry sliding wear test conditions.

TI Numerical Simulation for gamma/theta Interface Properties of Ni Base
   Superalloy
SO RARE METAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING
AB By using molecular dynamics method with the second nearest neighbor modified embedded-atom method (2NN MEAM) interatomic potential, we studied the gamma/theta-DO22 interfacial structure of Ni-Al-V superalloy at different compositions, and calculated the interfacial energy and the work of separation on the interfaces. The research shows that with the Al atom concentration increasing, the interfacial energy increases while the work of separation decreases; with the concentration of V atoms increasing, the interfacial energy increases first and then decreases; but the change of atomic concentration has little effect on the work of separation; and the interfacial energy and the work of separation are closely related to the interfacial migration. The results can be used to further study the dynamic behavior of Ni-Al-V superalloys in the process of precipitation, such as the composition segregation and interfacial migration, so the research has great guiding significance to the alloy design.

TI On the effect of Re addition on microstructural evolution of a
   CoNi-based superalloy
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB In this study, the effect of rhenium (Re) addition on microstructural evolution of a new low-density Co-Ni-Al-Mo-Nb based superalloy is presented. Addition of Re significantly influences the gamma' precipitate morphology, the gamma/gamma' lattice misfit and the gamma/gamma' microstructural stability during long term aging. An addition of 2 at.% Re to a Co-30Ni-10Al-5Mo-2Nb (all in at.%) alloy, aged at 900 degrees C for 50 h, reduces the gamma/gamma' lattice misfit by similar to 40% (from +0.32% to +0.19%, measured at room temperature) and hence alters the gamma' morphology from cuboidal to round-cornered cuboidal precipitates. The composition profiles across the gamma/gamma' interface by atom probe tomography (APT) reveal Re partitions to the gamma phase (K-Re = 0.34) and also results in the partitioning reversal of Mo to the gamma phase (K-Mo = 0.90) from the gamma' precipitate. An inhomogeneous distribution of Gibbsian interfacial excess for the solute Re (Gamma(Re), ranging from 0.8 to 9.6 atom.nm(-2)) has been observed at the gamma/gamma' interface. A coarsening study at 900 degrees C (up to 1000 h) suggests that the coarsening of gamma' precipitates occurs solely by evaporation-condensation (EC) mechanism. This is contrary to that observed in the Co-30Ni-10Al-5Mo-2Nb alloy as well as in some of the Ni-Al based and high mass density Co-Al-W based superalloys, where gamma' precipitates coarsen by coagulation/coalescence mechanism with an extensive alignment of gamma' along <100> directions as a sign of microstructural instability. The gamma' coarsening rate constant (K-r) and gamma/gamma' interfacial energy are estimated to be 1.13 x 10(-27) m(3)/s and 8.4 mJ/m(2), which are comparable and lower than Co-Al-W based superalloys.

TI Microstructure assessment at high temperature in NiCoCrAlY overlay
   coating obtained by laser metal deposition
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY-JMR&T
AB Laser metal deposition (LMD) and laser cladding (LC) could be innovative methods to the current thermal spray techniques for obtaining dense and high-quality bond coats with nickel and cobalt based superalloys in thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) systems. The microstructural evolution of the coatings when is subjected to high temperatures allows us to evaluate their oxidation behavior and integrity in the time, and is especially important in the development of bond coats for new TBCs systems. In this work, the microstructural evolution of a dense NiCoCrAlY overlay coating obtained by coaxial laser cladding and subjected to isothermal oxidation tests at 1100 degrees C up to 200 h was evaluated. The initial coating microstructure is composed of a beta-NiAl phase within the gamma-Ni matrix phase, and some Y inclusions, confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). At high temperature, the thermally-grown oxides (TGO) protect the underlying coating and substrate from oxidation, modifying the initial microstructure of the coating. The formation, morphology and evolution of oxides alpha-Al2O3, Y2O3, YA1O(3) and (Ni,Co)(AlCr2)(2) O-4-type spinel oxides on the cross section of the oxidized coating on different oxidation stages were evaluated using focused ion beam (FIB) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), and indexed by XRD and TEM. After oxidation tests, no cracks or spallation on oxidized sample for NiCoCrAlY coating were observed, and the formation of Y-Al oxides in TGO scale are strongly dependent on the initial Y distribution of as-built condition in the coating.

TI A Comprehensive Review of Corrosion Resistance of Thermally-Sprayed and
   Thermally-Diffused Protective Coatings on Steel Structures
SO JOURNAL OF THERMAL SPRAY TECHNOLOGY
AB Protective coatings are widely utilized to promote corrosion resistance of the surfaces of steel components that are used in various industrial applications. Different surface engineering methods such as thermal spraying and thermal diffusion techniques can be used to fabricate these protective coatings. Thermal spraying processes have received significant attention due to their ability to deposit a variety of materials. Several metals such as zinc-, aluminum-, nickel, and chromium-based materials and their alloys can be deposited using thermal spraying processes to enhance the corrosion resistance and prolong the service life of steel components. On the other hand, technologies based on thermal diffusion techniques are emerging due to their unique deposition features, which alleviates the issues of cracking and delamination typical of thermal-sprayed coatings, as well as their ability to protect inaccessible and complex components such as the inner surface of long tubing and pipelines. This work is a comprehensive review on short and long-term corrosion resistance of the most effective and commonly-used coatings deposited by a variety of surface engineering techniques to protect steel structures. Moreover, the effect of the spraying process, the addition of alloying elements on the corrosion resistance of these coatings has also been reviewed in this study.

TI Effect of Ti and Al on microstructure and partitioning behavior of
   alloying elements in Ni-based powder metallurgy superalloys
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MINERALS METALLURGY AND MATERIALS
AB The microstructure and partitioning behaviors of alloying elements in the gamma and gamma' phases in Ni-based powder metallurgy superalloys with different Ti and Al contents were investigated. The results showed that Ti and Al were mainly enriched in the gamma' phase, partially partitioned in the gamma matrix, and slightly distributed in the carbides. Different Ti and Al contents in various alloys influenced the composition and amount of MC carbides but did not influence the MC carbides' morphology. With increasing Ti and Al contents, gamma + gamma' fan-type structures formed at the grain boundary, eventually resulting in a coarsened gamma' phase. In addition, the morphology of the secondary gamma' phase transformed from nearly spherical to cuboidal. The saturation degrees of Cr, Co, and Mo in the gamma matrix were substantially improved with increasing Ti and Al contents.

   crystal nickel-based superalloys: A phase-field simulation incorporating
   dislocation dynamics
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB The initial gamma/gamma' microstructure (e.g. gamma' shape, size, volume fraction) may dramatically affect creep behaviour of single crystal Nickel-based superalloys. However, it is difficult to have accurate control on each of these initial aspects and to understand the role of each by experimental methods. In the present work, a novel coupled model of phase-field and continuum dislocation dynamics is developed for the co-evolution of gamma/gamma' and dislocation microstructures, such that the creep deformation of single crystal Nickel-based superalloys can be described in a physical way. The creep curve can be directly obtained by averaging dislocation activity, without any phenomenological effort that is needed for traditional constitutive models. With the coupled model, we study the effect of initial gamma/gamma' microstructure on creep of single crystal Nickel-based superalloys. The role of initial gamma' shape is studied by comparing simulations with different initial gamma' shapes but with the same gamma' size and volume fraction. The role of initial gamma' size and volume fraction are studied in the same methodology. Simulation results show that as the gamma/gamma' misfit magnitude increases, the gamma' shape transits from circular to cubic and the dislocation microstructure symmetry shifts. The cubic gamma' shape corresponding to gamma/gamma' misfit of -0.003 is the most beneficial for creep resistance, compare with gamma/gamma' misfit of -0.0015 and 0. Bigger gamma' size and higher gamma' volume fraction also result in better creep resistance, especially the benefit of high gamma' volume fraction to creep resistance is dramatic. The simulation results may bring inspirations for design of new single crystal Nickel-based superalloys with excellent creep resistance. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Cluster formulas of Co-Al-W-base superalloys
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Having a gamma/gamma' microstructure similar to Ni-base superalloys and also including various alloying elements such as Al and W, new Co-base superalloy, namely Co-Al-W-base alloy, has been widely studied as a kind of potential alternative of Ni-base superalloy, which is the most important high-temperature structural material in industrial applications. Besides, Co-Al-W-base alloy has also excellent mechanical properties, for example, creep properties comparable to those of the first-generation Ni-base single crystal superalloys. In our previous work, the ideal composition formula of Ni-base superalloy has been obtained by applying the cluster-plus-glue-atom structure model of faced centered cubic solid solution, which shows that the most stable chemical short-range-order unit is composed of a nearest-neighbor cluster and three next-neighbor glue atoms. In this paper, the ideal cluster formula of Co-Al-W-base superalloy is addressed by using the same approach. Based on cluster-plusglue-atom model theory, according to lattice constants and atom radii, calculations are carried out. The results show that the atom radius of Al is equal to Covalent radius (0.126 nm) and for gamma' phase the atom radius of W changes obviously (0.1316 nm). After analyzing atomic radii, the chemical formula for Co-Al-W ternary alloy is calculated to be [Al-Co-12](Co,Al,W)(3), which signifies an Al centered atom and twelve Co nearest-neighbored cluster atoms plus three glue atoms, which is in good consistence with that for Ni-base single crystal superalloy. For multi-element alloy, the alloying elements are classified, according to the heat of mixing between the alloying elements and Co as well as partition behavior of alloying elements, as solvent elements-Co-like elements (Co) over bar (Co, Ni, Ir, Ru, Cr, Fe, and Re) and solute elements-Al-like elements (Al) over bar (Al, W, Mo, Ta, Ti, Nb, V, etc.). The solvent elements can be divided into two kinds according to partition behaves: (Co) over bar (gamma) (Cr, Fe, and Re) and (Co) over bar (gamma)' (Ni, Ir, and Ru).
   The latter is further grouped into Al, (W) over bar (W and Mo, which have weaker heat of mixing than Al-Co ) and (Ta) over bar (Ta, Ti, Nb, V, etc., which have stronger heat of mixing than Al-Co). Then all chemically complex Co-Al-W-base superalloys are simplified into (Co) over bar-(Al) over bar pseudo-binary or (Co) over bar -Al-(W) over bar, (Ta) over bar pseudo-ternary system. Within the framework of the cluster-plus-glue-atom formulism and by analyzing the compositions of alloy, it is shown that the Co-Al-W-base superalloy satisfies the ideal formula [(Al) over bar-(Co) over bar (12)] ((Co) over bar (1.0)(Al) over bar (2.0)) (or [(Al) over bar-(Co) over bar Al-1.0(0.5)((W) over bar,(Ta) over bar)(1.5) = (Co) over bar (81.250)(Al) over bar9.375 ((W) over bar, (Ta) over bar)(9.375) at.%). In the same way, those of gamma and gamma' phases are respectively [(Al) over bar-(Co) over bar (12)] ((Co) over bar (1.5)(Al) over bar (1.5)) (or [Al-(Co) over bar (12)] (Co) over bar Al-0.5(2.5)((W) over bar, (Ta) over bar)(1.0 )= (Co) over bar Al-84.375(9.375)((W) over bar, (Ta) over bar)(6.250) at.%) and (Al) over bar-(Co) over bar (12)((Co) over bar (0.5 )(Al) over bar (2.5) ) (or [Al-(Co) over bar (12)]Co (Co) over bar (0.5) Al-0.5 ((W) over bar, (Ta) over bar)(2.0) = (Co) over bar Al-78.125(9.375) ((W) over bar, (Ta) over bar)(12.500) at.%). For example, alloy Co82Al9W9 and its gamma and gamma' phases are formulated respectively as [Al-Co-12] Co1.1Al0.4W1.4 (similar to[Al-Co-12]Co1.5Al0.5W1.0), [Al-Co-12]Co1.6Al0.4W1.0) (similar to[Al-Co-12]Co1.5Al0.5W1.0), and [Al-Co-12]Co0.3Al0.5W2.2) (similar to[Al-Co-12]Co0.5Al0.5W2.0).

TI Plastic deformation behaviors and mechanical properties of advanced
   single crystalline CoNi-base superalloys
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB With the aim of achieving an enhanced high-temperature strength compared to the Co-Ni-Al-W-Ti-Ta alloy from our previous study, a new single crystalline CoNi-base superalloy has been developed based on thermodynamic calculations. The gamma' solvus temperature and the gamma' volume fraction were experimentally determined as 1247 degrees C and 85.2%. Thermodynamic calculations correctly predict the tendency of how the alloying elements influence the thermophysical properties of investigated alloys. In comparison with the original Co-Ni-Al-W-Ti-Ta alloy, the newly developed CoNi-base alloy exhibited stronger compressive strength ranging from the room temperature to 1100 degrees C. The deformation behaviors at different temperature stages were investigated in detail. Interestingly, superlattice intrinsic stacking faults (SISFs) appear in the specimen deformed at the anomalous peak temperature, whereas the formation of SISF in the original Co-Ni-Al-W-Ti-Ta alloy occurs as the compression temperature increases beyond the anomalous peak temperature. The relationship between the occurrence of planar defects and the alloying effects was discussed.

TI Tension/Compression asymmetry of a creep deformed single crystal Co-base
   superalloy
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB The creep behavior of a multinary single crystal Co-base superalloy has been compared for uniaxial tension and compression of 400 MPa applied along [001] at 850 degrees C. Creep under tensile stress proceeds two times faster than creep under compression. A detailed TEM study shows that already after similar to 0.3 % creep strain planar faults are formed in both samples. While extended a/2<112> ribbons with SISF loops embedded in APBs are observed in tension, extrinsic SFs are revealed in compression. At similar to 5 % creep strain SISFs confined to the gamma' phase dominate in tension, whereas extrinsic SFs and microtwins extending across both phases are the prevalent planar faults in compression. In addition, dense networks of regular a/2<101> matrix dislocations develop at the gamma/gamma' interfaces in both loading scenarios. In tensile creep and early compressive creep the direct contribution of planar faults to plastic deformation is minor and does not exceed 10 % of the measured plastic strain. In contrast, thickening of microtwins appears to become an efficient deformation channel in the later stages of compressive creep. A pronounced asymmetry regarding the rafting kinetics is observed resulting in a P-type rafted and topologically inverted microstructure after similar to 5 % creep in tension while hardly any rafting has occurred under compression. The pronounced rafting and related recovery processes are likely responsible for the inferior creep behavior in tension. Finally, two novel diffusion-assisted degradation mechanisms related to microtwins are shown to be active: an expansion of the gamma phase into gamma' precipitates along microtwins and the formation of gamma phase nuclei at planar fault intersections inside gamma'. Both phenomena are hypothesized to be triggered by segregation of gamma formers like Co and Cr to planar faults. (C) 2019 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Modification of NiCoCrAlY with Pt: Part II. Application in TBC with pure
   metastable tetragonal (t ') phase YSZ and thermal cycling behavior
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB A thermal barrier coating system comprising Pt-modified NiCoCrAlY bond coating and nanostructured 4 mol.% yttria stabilized zirconia (4YSZ, hereafter) top coat was fabricated on a second generation Ni-base superalloy. Thermal cycling behavior of NiCoCrAlY-4YSZ thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) with and without Pt modification was evaluated in ambient air at 1100 degrees C up to 1000 cycles, aiming to investigate the effect of Pt on formation of thermally grown oxide (TGO) and oxidation resistance. Results indicated that a dual layered TGO, which consisted of top (Ni,Co)(Cr,Al)(2)O-4 spinel and underlying alpha-Al2O3, was formed at the NiCoCrAlY/4YSZ interface with thickness of 8.4 mu m, accompanying with visible cracks at the interface. In contrast, a single-layer and adherent alpha-Al2O3 scale with thickness of 5.6 mu m was formed at the interface of Pt-modified NiCoCrAlY and 4YSZ top coating. The modification of Pt on NiCoCrAlY favored the exclusive formation of alpha-Al2O3 and the reduction of TGO growth rate, and thus could effectively improve overall oxidation performance and extend service life of TBCs. Oxidation and degradation mechanisms of the TBCs with/without Pt-modification were discussed.

SO SCRIPTA MATERIALIA
AB The effect of phosphorous on the microstructure of a powder-processed, high Nb-content, Ni-based superalloy was studied and compared to a P-free variant. The P-doped sample had a lower incipient melting temperature, forming a (Ni, Co, Cr, P)(2)(Nb, Mo) laves phase along the grain boundaries. Transmission electron microscopy and atom probe tomography were used to identify the crystal structure, assess phase compositions, and determine any elemental segregation to phase boundaries. The results revealed strong partitioning of P to the laves phase and a slight Mo gradient towards the phrase. Finally, a simplified laves phase was successfully modeled via density functional theory calculations. (C) 2018 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Enhancement of hot corrosion resistance of thermal barrier coatings by
   using nanostructured Gd2Zr2O7 coating
SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB Improvement of hot corrosion resistance in Na2SO4-V2O5 environments is one of the main goals in development of thermal barrier coatings (TBCs). In this study, nano-Gd2Zr2O7 (nano-GZ) powder was synthesized by co precipitation method and then deposited with atmospheric plasma spray (APS) technique on Ni-based superalloy (IN738LC) substrates as a top coat with a CoNiCrAIY bond coat. Hot corrosion behavior of nano-GZ coated samples were studied and compared with those of CoNiCrAlY/conventional YSZ coatings. Hot corrosion resistance of the samples was investigated in a cyclic mode in which after each 4 h exposure to Na2SO4-55 wt% V2O5 salts at 950 degrees C. The results indicated that nano-GZ coatings have better hot corrosion resistance compared to conventional YSZ coatings. It was found that micro-cracks and pores played a main role in the molten salts infiltration into the TBC5 during hot corrosion process. In the nano-GZ coating with nano zones structure which surrounded by fully molten parts could fill the aforementioned defects and could act as barrier for the corrosive molten salts penetration into the TBC. The main factor in destruction of the investigated coatings is the formation and growth of needle-like YVO4 and GdVO4 crystals, in both classes of the coatings.

TI Effects of Nb on hot tensile deformation behavior of cast Haynes 25
   Co-Cr-W-Ni alloy
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Effect of Nb on the hot tensile deformation behavior of cast Haynes 25 Co-Cr-W-Ni alloy was investigated in temperature range of 950-1200 degrees C. In the base alloy, thermodynamic calculations showed that M23C6 and M6C are the stable forms of carbides at temperatures below 1000 degrees C and over 1050 degrees C, respectively. For Nb-containing alloy, however, WC and NbC are observed below 1050 degrees C. At higher temperatures, W carbides dissolve and tungsten diffuses into NbC particles to form complex carbides. The yield point phenomena (YPP) were observed in both alloys at temperatures over 1050 degrees C due to the immobilization of matrix dislocations by W, Cr and C. Addition of Nb increased the strength and elongation due to the precipitation of NbC carbides. Absorbing the solute atoms and favoring dynamic recrystallization (DRX) seems to be the possible mechanisms. Loss of hot ductility occurred in both alloys at 1050 degrees C. It was attributed to the dissolution of carbides into matrix and their negative effects on dynamic recovery (DRV) and recrystallization. DRX was the major microstructural mechanism at high temperature, e.g. 1150 degrees C. At low temperatures, e.g. 950 degrees C, only DRV occurred. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SO RARE METALS
AB Hot corrosion behavior of FGH96 powder metallurgy (P/M) superalloy in 25% NaCl+75% Na2SO4 molten salts at 650, 700, and 750 degrees C was investigated in this paper. The methods of mass loss measurement, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) were used here. The experimental results show that hot corrosion kinetics follows a square power law at 650 degrees C, while a linear one at 700 and 750 degrees C. The corrosion layer is detected to be composed of Cr2O3, NiO, and Ni2S3 at each temperature. The cross-sectional morphologies and corresponding elemental maps indicate that the corrosion layer is a stratified structure of oxide and sulfide. The results and analyses confirm that the hot corrosion mechanism of FGH96 P/M superalloy is a cooperate process of oxidation and sulfidation. Furthermore, the relatively higher concentrations of Cr, Co, and Ti provide better corrosion resistance to the attack of S and Cl-.

TI Surface/Interface Quality Diagnosis of Alloy Casting by Laser Induced
   Breakdown Spectroscopy
SO SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
AB The investment precision casting technology is widely adopted in manufacturing superalloy castings. Single crystal superalloy casting blades have high precision in dimension, without inner defects and surface defects. Knobs, pits and shrinkage cavity on surface of castings are caused by unsuitable temperature field, melted alloy flow field, and interface reaction of melted alloy with ceramic shell. The laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) is an efficient surface and interface analysis technique, with obvious advantage in diagnosis of casting surface/interface, with micro destruction, independent on surface planeness of sample. The parameters were optimized in depth analysis of single crystal superalloy by LIBS. A good spatial resolution has been obtained at 2 mm aperture, 500 mJ of output energy and off focus radiation with 1 064 nm pulse Gaussian laser beam; meanwhile spectrum signal distortion brought from ablation and excitation of surface by exceeding secondary diffraction ring with low laser energy density was reduced. Ablated volume per pulse was linear to output of laser energy with good correlation, positively correlated to the aperture diameter, independent on shot frequency. Depth analysis of surface and interface of single crystal superalloy blade was performed by LIBS. Alloy depletion of Al, Ti, Ni, Cr and Co in DD407 single crystal blade was observed with significant depletion of Al and Ti up to 50 mu m depth, using SiO2 -Al2O3 ceramic shell with mullite phase in cast process. The alloy depletion of edge of the blade was more outstanding than thick part. Precipitation of calcium salt, magnesium salt, sodium salt and carbon matters on blade surface occurs after dissolution to remove ceramic shell and ceramic core. Sodium salt has been removed completely after washed with boiling water and ultrasonic washing; most of calcium matters, magnesium matters and carbon matters have been removed and small amount remained in 3 similar to 5 mu m depth. LIBS is efficient in terms of composition-depth distribution analysis of alloy casting surface and interface, providing surface/interface quality criteria and presenting bright application prospect.

TI Investigation on the homogenization treatment and element segregation on
   the microstructure of a /-cobalt-based superalloy
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MINERALS METALLURGY AND MATERIALS
AB The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of element segregation on the microstructure and phase in a / cobalt- based superalloy. Several samples were prepared from a cast alloy and homogenized at 1300 degrees C for different times, with a maximum of 24 h. A microstructural study of the cast alloy using wavelength-dispersive spectroscopic analysis revealed that elements such as Al, Ti, and Ni segregated mostly within interdendritic regions, whereas W atoms were segregated within dendrite cores. With an increase in homogenization time, segregation decreased and the initial dendritic structure was eliminated. Field-emission scanning electron microscopy micrographs showed that the phases in the cores and interdendritic regions of the as-cast alloy were 392 and 124 nm, respectively. The size difference of was found to be due to the different segregation behaviors of constituent elements during solidification. After homogenization, particularly after 16 h, segregation decreased; thus, the size, chemical composition, and hardness of the precipitated phase was mostly uniform throughout the samples.

TI gamma '-(L1(2)) precipitate evolution during isothermal aging of a
   Co-Al-W-Ni superalloy
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB The coarsening kinetics and elemental partitioning behavior of gamma'-(L1(2)) precipitates in a gamma(f.c.c.)-matrix for a model quaternary Co-8.8Al-8.9W-9.9Ni at.% superalloy are investigated utilizing isothermal aging conditions at 650, 800 and 900 degrees C. The gamma'-precipitate mean radius, number density, and volume fraction, at 800 and 900 degrees C, were studied using scanning electron microscopy; the calculated temporal exponents associated with coarsening of gamma'-precipitates display good agreement with model predictions for quasi stationary coarsening. An atom probe tomographic (APT) investigation of the aged gamma/gamma' microstructure at 650 degrees C demonstrates that the compositions and volume fractions of both phases vary continuously up to 4096 h. The aged microstructure at 650 degrees C consists of interconnected nanoscale gamma'-precipitates, corroborated utilizing SEM for the 4096 h aged-specimen. The activation energy for coarsening is estimated for the temperature range 650-900 degrees C to be 283 kJ mol(-1), in reasonable agreement with activation energies for diffusion of Al, W, and Ni in Co, suggesting that coarsening of gamma'-precipitates is limited by bulk-diffusion. APT measurements of specimens aged for 1024 hat 800 and 900 degrees C demonstrate that the isothermal aging temperature has a significant effect on the compositions and partitioning behavior of Co, Al, W and Ni between the gamma- and gamma'-phases. The partitioning ratio of the concentrations between the gamma'- and gamma-phases is largest for W, decreasing linearly from 5.3 +/- 0.1 at 650 degrees C to 2.1 +/- 1.2 at 900 degrees C, and smallest for Co, decreasing from 0.86 +/- 0.01 at 650 degrees C to 0.73 +/- 0.01 at 900 degrees C.

TI Estimation of gamma/gamma ' interfacial energy in Ni-Co base superalloy
   TMW-4M3
SO JOURNAL OF CRYSTAL GROWTH
AB The interfacial energy between the gamma and gamma ' phase in Ni-Co base superalloy TMW-4M3 was investigated using both a kinetic analysis of experimental data and a thermodynamic analysis. The coarsening rate of gamma' precipitates during the aging treatment process was analyzed using extended Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner theory, including the contribution of a full diffusion matrix with a thermodynamic calculation. The interfacial energies calculated from the coarsening kinetics using only the diagonal components were half as large as those using the off-diagonal contributions as well. The interfacial energy with full diffusion matrix contributions is about 75 mJ/m(2) between 1373 and 1413 K. In addition, the interfacial energy was also analyzed on the basis of the extended Becker's model (EBM), and the results, which ranged from 73.9 to 76.3 mJ/m(2 ), showed good agreements with those from the coarsening kinetics. A comparison of the interfacial energy between TMW-4M3 and several Ni base superalloys indicated an identical tendency of higher interfacial energy with a larger Ti/Al ratio. The off-diagonal terms of a diffusion matrix are very important in analyzing the coarsening kinetics of gamma' and gamma/gamma' the interfacial energy estimation using the EBM is a suitable method for TMW-4M3.

TI Diffusion brazing repair of IN738 superalloy with crack-like defect:
   microstructure and tensile properties at high temperatures
SO SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY OF WELDING AND JOINING
AB In this study, tapered slots with an opening width about 200 mu m were artificially fabricated in IN738LC superalloy to imitate service cracks. The 'cracks' were repaired by diffusion brazing with a Ni-Cr-Co-Al-Ta-B filler alloy at 1150 degrees C and then heat treated at 1180 degrees C (HT-A) and 1190 degrees C (HT-B), respectively. A joint with uniform microstructure, chemical composition and hardness was obtained using HT-B. The mechanisms of the borides evolution during homogenisation were discussed. The tensile strength of the HT-B joint tested at 20, 600 and 800 degrees C reached up to approximately 96, 90 and 87% of the base metal, respectively. The fracture modes of the joints tensile tested at various temperatures were discussed.

TI Primary Microstructure Characterization of As-Casted Co-20Ni-7Al-7W
   Superalloy
SO ARCHIVES OF FOUNDRY ENGINEERING
AB The primary microstructure of new Co-based superalloy of Co-20Ni-7Al-7W (at.%) type was showed in this article. The alloy was manufactured by induction melting in vacuum furnaces. This alloy is a part of new group of high-temperature materials based on Co solid solution and strengthened by coherent L1(2) phase similar to Ni-based superalloys with gamma' phase. The final form of Co-ss/L1(2) microstructure is obtained after fully heat treatment included homogenization, solutionizing and aging processes. But first step of heat treatment thermal parameters determination is characterization of primary microstructure of alloys after casting process with special attentions on segregations of alloying elements in solid solution and presences of structural elements such as eutectic areas, and other phases precipitations. In analysed case the relatively high homogeneity of chemical composition was expected especially in the case of W distribution, what was confirmed be SEM/EDS analysis in dendritic and interdendritic areas.

TI ISOTHERMAL OXIDATION BEHAVIOR OF ELECTROSPARK DEPOSITED NiCrAlY COATINGS
   ON A NI-BASED SINGLE-CRYSTAL SUPERALLOY
SO MATERIALI IN TEHNOLOGIJE
AB The isothermal oxidation behavior of a NiCrAlY coating prepared by means of electrospark deposition (ESD) technology on second-generation Ni-based single-crystal DD6 was investigated at 1100 degrees C for 100 h. Surface morphologies, chemical composition, and the phase constitution of the coating were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive spectrometer (EDS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The results showed that the as-deposited NiCrAlY coating, with uniform superfine columnar crystals and nanocrystallines. consists of beta-NiAl and gamma-Ni double phases; the oxidation resistance of the DD6 alloy was greatly improved by depositing the NiCrAlY coating, which was covered by two layers of oxides, theta-Al2O3 and alpha-Al2O3, while three layers of oxides, including Ni(Co)O, NiCr2O4, CrTaO4, CoTa2O6 and alpha-Al2O3, formed on the DD6 superalloy; the interdiffusion zone (IDZ) and secondary reaction zone (SRZ) formed between the NiCrAlY coating and the DD6 superalloy substrate for the interdiffusion; however, no deleterious Kirkendall voids appeared, which may be mainly due to the gradient transition of the elements between the coating and the substrate.

TI First Demonstration of Additive Manufacturing of Cutting Tools using
   Directed Energy Deposition System: Stellite (TM)-Based Cutting Tools
SO ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING
AB Machine-tool concepts are becoming increasingly complex to meet the demanding requirements of advanced applications. This raises per-tool costs for manufacturers and end users, motivating the development of novel, innovative fabrication methods for these tools. Our objective herein is to investigate laser-based additive manufacturing to fabricate application-optimized machine-tools that perform comparably to commercially-available products. To demonstrate this technology, multi-layer Stellite (TM) (Co-Cr-W superalloy) structures were deposited on a stainless-steel substrate via directed energy deposition technique to be used as a tool for cutting applications requiring high-temperature strength and ductility, an area where conventional carbide and high-speed steel tools are challenged. The as-printed structures were free of large-scale defects and voids, and were further characterized and compared to commercial Blackalloy 525 barstock (B525), a Co-Cr-W alloy tool of similar composition. The Stellite (TM) contained mostly Co-rich (alpha-phase) dendrites, as well as inter-dendritic Cr7C3 and Cr23C6 phases. The B525 composition consisted of a range of lamellar-eutectic microstructure comprised of Co-phase with W6C reinforcement. In reciprocating wear testing, Stellite (TM) 6 maintained a steady-state COF within 20% of B525 (0.36 +/- 0.01 vs. 0.30 +/- 0.01), and final wear rate as low as 38% difference from B525 (5.14*10(-6) +/- 4.58*10(-7) N/mm(3)vs. 3.20*10(-6) +/- 4.99*10(-7 )N/mm(3)). During a turning operation of SS304L, the mm mm Stellite (TM) 6 tool demonstrated consistent chip formation and more consistent rake-face and cratering wear in comparison to the B525 tool, indicating its adequacy for service in this application. Our results demonstrate for the first time that directed-energy-deposition can be utilized to fabricate advanced cutting tool concepts for job-specific applications.

TI Exploring the hindering mechanism of element Ti on the adherence of
   CoO-bearing one-coat enamel/steel
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED CERAMIC TECHNOLOGY
AB The effect of element Ti on adherence between a CoO-bearing single-layer enamel coating and steel was investigated. Falling-weights tests were carried out and cross-sections at interface of the enamel/substrate were analyzed with a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) coupled with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). Results show that addition of TiO2 reduced adherence of the enamel coating by hindering the formation of anchor-like alloy precipitates. The decrease of anchor points lies in the following three reasons: I. The diffusion path of Co2+ ions to the interface was lengthened because of the blocking effect of rutile and the FeTiO3 crystals; II. Formation of CoTiO3 crystals leads to a reduction of free Co2+ ions; III. Co-Fe precipitates form away from the enamel/substrate interface, as FeTiO3 crystals provide extra surface for the nucleation of Fe-Co alloy precipitates.

TI Preparation of a Duplex Nanocrystalline Coating by Magnetron Sputtering
   and Its Oxidation Performance
SO JOURNAL OF NANOSCIENCE AND NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB A duplex nanocrystalline coating was prepared in this study by magnetron sputtering on N5 single-crystal super alloy (Ni: Bal, Co: 7.5, Cr: 7.0, Al: 6.2, Ta: 6.5, Re: 3.0, Mo: 1.5 and W: 5.0, wt%). The novel nanocrystalline coating consists of two layers, the inner layer having the same composition with the alloy substrate for avoiding elements inter diffusion while the outer layer has 7.6 wt% higher Al to quickly ensure the formation of a protective Al2O3 layer. Both two layers were deposited within one magnetron sputtering apparatus that contained two targets. The main target was having the same alloy substrate in composition and secondary target with pure Al. The difference in Al content between the two layers was achieved by controlling the secondary target during sputtering. This study revealed a way for preparing a series of similar coatings with varying compositions and improving performance. After oxidation at 1050 degrees C, a protective Al2O3 layer was quickly formed on the duplex nanocrystalline coating and no TCP phases were detected in the alloy substrate.

TI Effect of heat treatment and hot working on microstructure and
   mechanical properties of a novel nickel base superalloy
SO LETTERS ON MATERIALS
AB The microstructure and mechanical properties of a novel nickel base superalloy intended for manufacturing of die tools and parts for gas turbine engine have been investigated. The superalloy designated as SLZhS-1R had the following composition: Ni-47(Al, Cr, Co, Ta, W, Hf)-0.2(C, B) (wt. %). The as-cast superalloy was subjected to homogenization and heterogenization heat treatment, which is typically performed before hot working. However, the heat treatment led to appearance of platelike precipitates, which are not favorable for the hot workability. Therefore, the superalloy was subjected to hot working taking the as-cast condition as the initial one. To do it, unidirectional hot forging at a temperature slightly below the.' solvus temperature with a strain rate of epsilon' similar to 10(-2) s(-1) was carried out. The as-cast superalloy showed reasonable workability that allowed producing sound forgings. The forging procedure provided formation of mixed microstructure consisted of coarse non-recrystallized and fine recrystallized. grains. EBSD analysis of the forged workpiece showed that the fraction of highangle grain boundaries was insignificant. The hot forging resulted in dynamic recovery, whereas recrystallization processes occurred only locally near the. grain boundaries. Tensile tests were carried out for the heat treated and hot forged conditions as well as for the as-cast condition. The heat treated and especially the forged and heat treated condition showed appreciably higher strength and ductility as compared to those of the

TI High Temperature Oxidation Behavior of Co-Cr-Y2O3 Modified Aluminide
   Coatings on Ni-based Superalloy by Pack Cementation Process
SO RARE METAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING
AB The microstructure and high temperature oxidation behavior of Co-Cr-Y2O3 modified pack aluminide coatings on Ni-based superalloy GH586 were investigated. The results show that the specific Co-Cr-Y2O3 modified aluminide coating has a mass gain of only 0.36 mg/cm(2) after oxidation at 1000 degrees C for 100 h, which is much less than that of the substrate at 1000 degrees C. From X-ray diffraction, the phase of the coatings is mainly AINi, and after oxidation at 1000 degrees C for 100 h the denser oxidation scale is composed of Al2O3, Cr2O3, and CoCr2O4. Surface and cross sectional morphologies were characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM). The coating exhibits a better resistance to high temperature oxidation, compared to the oxidation film of GH586 without coating. Moreover, the growing Cr (W) rich phase is gradually gathered at the grain boundaries during the oxidation, and it is beneficial to providing more Cr element for the dense oxidation film, which is mainly attributed to the excellent high temperature oxidation resistance.

TI Flow behaviors and microstructural evolutions of a novel high-Co powder
   metallurgy superalloy during hot working
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY
AB To understand how to tailor microstructure of high-Co polycrystalline superalloys during hot processing, the flow curves of a nickel-based superalloy with high Co content was quantitatively analyzed, and the microstructure evolution was studied by a high-throughput method. The results suggested that hot working conditions, especially the temperature, strongly influenced the grain structure at annealing. In specific, deforming under low strain rate and high temperature conditions facilitated the recovery and grain growth to consume the stored strain energy, furthermore, the weakened pinning effects of gamma' precipitates accelerated these procedures, which made the high-Co superalloy more vulnerable to the formation of abnormally large grains during subsequent supersolvus annealing.

TI Type II Hot Corrosion Screening Tests of a Cr2AlC MAX Phase Compound
SO OXIDATION OF METALS
AB Low-temperature hot corrosion tests were performed on bulk Cr2AlC MAX phase compounds for the first time. This material is a known alumina-former with good oxidation and Type I high-temperature hot corrosion resistance. Unlike traditional (Ni,Co)CrAl alumina formers, it contains no Ni or Co that may react with Na2SO4 salt deposits needed to form corrosive mixed (Ni,Co)SO4-Na2SO4 eutectic salts active in Type II hot corrosion. Cr2AlC samples coated with 20K(2)SO(4)-80Na(2)SO(4) salt were exposed to 300ppm SO2 at 700 degrees C for times up to 500h. Weight change, recession, and cross-sectional microstructures identified some reactivity, but much reduced (<1/10) compared to a Ni(Co) superalloy baseline material. Layered Al2O3/Cr2O3 scales were indicated, either separated by or intermixed with some retained salt. However, there was no conclusive indication of salt melting. Accelerated oxidation was proposed to explain the results, and coarse Cr7C3 impurities appeared to play a negative role. In contrast, the superalloy exhibited outer Ni(Co) oxide and inner Cr2O3 scales, with Cr-S layers at the interfaces. Massive spallation of the corrosion layers occurred repeatedly for the superalloy, but not at all for Cr2AlC. This indicates some potential for Cr2AlC as LTHC-resistant coatings for superalloys.

AB Five novel Co-30N1-(6 + x)Al-(3-y)W-yMo-1Ta-3.5Ti-12Cr-0.1Hf-0.025 C (x = 0, y = 0, 1, and x = 2, y = 0, 1, 2 at%) multi-component polycrystalline gamma'-strengthened Co-base superalloys are designed to investigate the effects of Al and Mo content on the microstructure and properties in this study. Based on the 6Al3W alloy, the addition of 2 at% Al has the effects of increasing the gamma' solvus temperature, reducing the density, increasing the gamma' volume fraction and coarsening rate, reducing the Vickers hardness but increasing the yield strength at 750 degrees C. The replacement of 1 at% W by 1 at% Mo remarkably reduced the density with a negligible effect on the gamma' coarsening rate; Meanwhile, this slightly reduced the gamma' solvus temperature and volume fraction causing a slight decrease of Vickers hardness and yield strength at 750 degrees C. The experimental alloys all show relatively low density, large processing window, good microstructure stability at 750 degrees C and mechanical properties, especially for 6Al2W1Mo alloy which has density of 8.69 g cm(-3), processing window of 247 degrees C, room-temperature Vickers hardness of 5.1 GPa, stable microstructure without detrimental phase after a heat treatment of 900 degrees C @8 h + 750 degrees C @1000 h. These results may provide guidance for the development of the novel wrought Co-base superalloys with high performance and low density.

SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB The effects of Ta and Ti on the microstructure, segregation and solidification path of Co-7A1-8W-base alloy were investigated using directional solidification quenching experiments and isothermal solidification quenching experiments. The results showed that the as-cast microstructure of the Co-7Al-8W alloy (Base alloy) is the gamma single phase. The Al element slightly segregates to the interdendritic regions, the W element slightly segregates to the dendritic core, and Co has almost no segregation. The solidification path of the Co-7Al-8W-4Ti alloy is L -> L-1+gamma -> L-2+gamma+(beta+gamma')(e) -> L-3+gamma+(beta+gamma')(e)+gamma'->gamma+(beta+gamma')(e)+gamma', After the addition of 1 at.% Ti, there is no change in the segregation of elements, the microstructure and the solidification path of the alloy. The Ta element strongly segregates to the interdendritic regions in the Co-7Al-8W-1Ta alloy. With the addition of 4 at.% Ti, the Ti element strongly segregates to the interdendritic regions, and the segregation of Al and W elements increases. Blocky gamma' phase and (beta+y')(e) eutectics form in the interdendritic regions. The solidification path of the Co-7Al-8W-4Ti alloy is L -> L-1+gamma -> L-2+gamma+(beta+Y')(e) -> L-3+gamma+(beta+gamma')(e)+gamma' ->gamma+(beta+gamma')(e)+y', After the addition of 1 at.% Ta+4 at.% Ti, the segregation of Al, Ta and Ti decreases, while the segregation of W increases. Laves phase, blocky gamma' phase and ((beta+y')e eutectics form in the interdendritic regions. The solidification path of the Co-7A1-8W-1Ta-4Ti alloy is L -> L-1+gamma -> L-2+gamma+Laves -> L-3+gamma+Laves+(beta+gamma')(e) -> L-4+gamma+Laves+(beta+gamma')(e)+gamma' -> gamma+Laves+(beta+gamma')(e)+gamma'. The above results could provide an experimental basis for composition optimization and solidification process control of novel gamma'-strengthened Co-base superalloys. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

By combining energy-dispersive X-ray analysis and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy high-throughput composition measurements, a detailed evaluation of the dependence between the initial multinary metal composition and the oxide scale composition which is forming upon oxidation on the surface of the thin film is established. Phase maps for both materials libraries are provided by high-throughput X-ray diffraction. In addition, the oxidation of a Co-Al-Cr-W bulk sample was analyzed and compared to a corresponding film in the library.

TI Accounting for lattice coherency in a two-phase elastic-plastic
   self-consistent model for nickel-based superalloys
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLASTICITY
AB A 2-site elastic-plastic self-consistent (EPSC) model is developed and implemented in order to account for crystallographic texture development and grain morphology evolution under strong correlations between neighbor grains of different phases, both in space and orientation. Predictions of the model adequately fit the published in situ neutron diffraction data for nickel-based superalloys at ambient and elevated temperatures, in which gamma and gamma' phases exhibit exact cube-cube orientation relationship. Comparison with 2-site model (small strain algorithm, nonrotation scheme) and 1-site model (finite strain algorithm, co-rotation scheme) has been made, and the result shows that the present 2-site model (finite strain algorithm, rotation scheme) leads to better predictions in lattice strain evolution where both rotation of crystal lattice and correlation between inclusions are accounted for, especially when the applied strain is larger than 0.02 for transverse direction and 0.05 similar to 0.18 for axial direction for the materials studied in this work. Based on a systematic study on the effects of grain-grain interaction and total grain number on the homogenized results, we found that transverse lattice strains of gamma (200) and/or gamma' (100) are sensitive to the interplay between gamma-gamma' interaction and evolution of grain orientation distribution with deformation, while that of gamma (220) and gamma' (110) are sensitive to the initial crystallographic texture.

TI The origin and stability of nanostructural hierarchy in crystalline
   solids
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB The structural hierarchy exhibited by materials on more than one length scale can play a major part in determining bulk material properties. Understanding the hierarchical structure can lead to new materials with physical properties tailored for specific applications. We have used a combined experimental and phase-field modeling approach to explore such a hierarchical structure at nanoscale for enhanced coarsening resistance of ordered gamma' precipitates in an experimental, multicomponent, high-refractory nickel-base superalloy. The hierarchical microstructure formed experimentally in this alloy is composed of a gamma matrix with gamma' precipitates that contain embedded, spherical gamma precipitates, which do not directionally coarsen during high-temperature annealing but do delay coarsening of the larger gamma' precipitates. Chemical mapping via atom probe tomography suggests that the supersaturation of Co, Ru, and Re in they' phase is the driving force for the phase separation, leading to the formation of this hierarchical microstructure. Representative phase-field modeling highlights the importance of larger gamma' precipitates to promote stability of the embedded gamma phase and to delay coarsening of the encompassing gamma' precipitates. Our results suggest that the hierarchical material design has the potential to influence the high-temperature stability of precipitate strengthened metallic materials.

TI Effect of microstructure on early oxidation of MCrAlY coatings
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB Two MCrAlY coatings with the same nominal composition, but different microstructures are deposited onto Hastelloy (R) X superalloy substrates by low-pressure plasma spraying (LPPS) and high velocity oxygen fuel (HVOF) spraying, respectively. The early oxidation behaviour of the coatings at 1150 degrees C is studied. For the LPPS coating with relative coarse grains, the gamma and beta-phase show different oxidation behaviours: the oxide on the gamma-phase shows a multi-layer structure, consisting of outer (Ni,Co) (Cr,Al)(2)O-4, intermediate (Cr,Al)(2)O-3 and inner alpha-Al2O3; the oxidation of the beta-phase, however, is characterised by selective oxidation of aluminium and the oxide is composed of a mixture of theta and alpha-Al2O3. a For the nanocrystalline HVOF coating, it does not show site-specific oxidation and the oxidation is characterised by formation of an exclusive alpha-Al2O3 scale over the surface. The microstructure-dependent oxidation is quantitatively described from the perspective of oxidation kinetics, with contribution from both lattice and grain boundary diffusion taken into consideration. A critical grain size of the gamma-phase, below which formation of an exclusive Al2O3 scale can be achieved, is predicted and verified. The study gives new insights into oxidation of MCrAlY coatings.

TI Temporal evolution of a model Co-Al-W superalloy aged at 650 degrees C
   and 750 degrees C
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB The temporal evolution of a gamma(f.c.c.)/gamma' (L1(2)) Co-8.8Al-73 W superalloy aged at 650 degrees C (10 min-4096 h) and 750 degrees C (10 min-256 h) is studied utilizing atom-probe tomography (APT), scanning electron microscopy, and Vickers microhardness testing. The evolution of the phase compositions, gamma' (L1(2)) volume fraction, and mean precipitate radius, <R2-D(t)>, are determined. Coarsening rate constants and temporal exponents are calculated for <R-D(t)> of the gamma' (L1(2))-nanoprecipitates. The temporal exponents are found to be generally close to 1/p = 1/3 as required for diffusion-limited coarsening. Tungsten solid-solubility is significantly reduced in the gamma(f.c.c.)-matrix at 650 degrees C (0.54 +/- 0.04 at. %) and 750 degrees C (1.35 +/- 0.06 at. %) when compared with aging at 900 degrees C (5.5 at. %). The value of <R-2D(t)> of the gamma' (L1(2))-nanoprecipitates increases with increasing aging time corresponding to an increase in the Vickers microhardness; the peak strength was not, however, achieved for the aging times investigated. The morphology of the gamma' (L1(2))-nanoprecipitates begins as spheroids but transitions to cuboids at longer aging times, with final the gamma' (L1(2)) volume fractions for aging at 650 degrees C and 750 degrees C being phi = 53% and 54%, respectively. The effect of quench-rate (either furnace-cooled, air-cooled, oil quenched, or water quenched) from a supersolvus temperature of 1050 degrees C on the microstructure of the alloy is also investigated. Slow cooling (furnace and air-cooling) is shown to result in a uniform distribution of nanometer sized gamma' (L1(2))-nanoprecipitates, unlike Ni-based superalloys in which the gamma' (L1(2))-nanoprecipitates form in a non-uniform or multimodal distribution.

   superalloy
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Oxidation behavior of a novel cobalt-nickel-base superalloy in air from 600 to 900 degrees Cis investigated in details. The results indicate a two-layer oxide film formed on the surface after oxidation: the external layer of oxide film is mainly composed of Cr2O3 and a few of other oxides, and the inner layer dominantly contains Al2O3. During oxidation at higher temperature and long duration, evaporation of Mo-containing oxide leads to void formation and local failure in external oxide layer, characterized by roughening of oxide film. A formation mechanism of oxide film on this alloy during oxidation is proposed for the first time. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SELF-PROPAGATING HIGH-TEMPERATURE SYNTHESIS
AB Powders of new CompoNiAl M5-3 heat-resistant alloy were prepared by mechanoactivated SHS from (Ni-Al-Cr-Co-Hf)-NaCl mixtures. Ni dissolution in Al melt was found to be the motive force of combustion. Unlike the binary Ni-Al system, NiAl is formed not in the melt but in the post-combustion zone as a result of diffusion-controlled processes. Conditions for MASHS were optimized toward fabrication of a superalloy with homogeneous composition/structure and low content of gas impurities. As-prepared combustion product was disintegrated into a powder and the latter was subjected to plasma spheroidization, keeping in mind the needs of additive manufacturing. The attained degree of spheroidization was 98%. The structure and phase/chemical compositions of spherical powders did not differ from those of the synthesized powders. After plasma treatment, the content of gas impurities (?(2) and N-2) decreased.

TI Homogenization heat treatment and segregation analysis of equiaxed
   CMSX-4 superalloy for gas turbine components
SO JOURNAL OF THERMAL ANALYSIS AND CALORIMETRY
AB Homogenization heat treatment and segregation analysis of equiaxed CMSX-4 nickel-based superalloy were investigated. The researches were focused on studying the influence of a multi-cycle heat treatment on the evolution of CMSX-4 superalloy in terms of microstructure and porosity. The heat treatment temperature was selected based on the chemical composition of superalloy and thermodynamic calculations of solidification path and phase formation using a thermodynamic software. Elemental partition coefficients were calculated using the local chemical compositions in different areas of the samples, before and after each heat treatment cycle. It was observed that Al, Ti and Ta segregate in the interdendritic regions and eutectic gamma-gamma' pools, while W, Re and Co segregate mainly in the dendrite cores and the dendrite arms. The compositional analysis shows an increase in the structure homogeneity after the heat treatment, but a certain compositional gradient between the dendrite cores and the interdendritic regions is still observed. The qualitative analysis based on the backscattered electron images sustains the results obtained from the compositional analysis regarding the homogenization of the alloy. A descending evolution of the cuboidal gamma' phase was observed until 6 h of holding, but after 9 h of holding at 1573 K the size of cuboidal gamma' phase starts to grow especially in the interdendritic regions. After long temperature holding time, a notable increase in porosity level was observed due to the partition coefficients of the alloying elements and dissolution of the residual phases (eutectic gamma-gamma' pools, coarse gamma').

TI Characterization of the Hot Deformation Behavior and Microstructure
   Evolution of a New gamma-gamma ' Strengthened Cobalt-Based Superalloy
SO METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND
   MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Recently, cobalt-based gamma-gamma' microstructured superalloys have attracted attention. However, studies on their processing behavior [i.e., processing maps (the variation of strain rate sensitivity (m) with temperature)] are limited. Thus, the high-temperature flow behavior of a gamma-gamma' Co-30Ni-10Al-5Mo-2Ta-2Ti-5Cr (at. pct) superalloy was investigated using isothermal compression tests between 1348 and 1498 K at strain rates from 0.001 to 10 s(-1). The m contour map was generated using the experimental flow stress values, which were used to locate the optimum hot workability and desired microstructural processing range. A strong dependence of m on the deformation parameters (temperature, strain rate, and strain) was observed. A maximum m value of around 0.3 at 1460 K to 1498 K and strain rates of 0.01 to 0.5 s(-1) was found. The deformed samples show a fully recrystallized microstructure at high m. Unstable domains showed the formation of cavities at the grain boundary triple points and cracks along the grain boundaries at high strain rates (1 to 10 s(-1)), corresponding to m < 0.10. A constitutive model was developed using an Arrhenius hyperbolic sine function, yielding an apparent activation energy of 540 +/- 30 kJ mol(-1) for hot deformation. This study indicates reasonable formability under certain conditions below the solvus, thus opening possibilities for further thermomechanical treatment.

TI Predicting the Load-Carrying Capacity and Wear Resistance of
   Duplex-Coated Low-Strength Alloys for Severe Service Ball Valves
SO JOURNAL OF THERMAL SPRAY TECHNOLOGY
AB The load-carrying capacity and wear resistance of a duplex-coated 316 stainless steel were determined, and a finite element numerical approach was developed to predict and corroborate experimental observations. Low-strength alloys are generally used for highly demanding valve applications due to their superior chemical stability, galvanic corrosion resistance, and lower susceptibility to stress corrosion cracking failure. Hardfacing (using thermal spraying, laser cladding, or plasma transferred arc welding) is currently the most common solution to protect valve components. Hardfacing provides a thick, hardened case that significantly improves tribological performance. However, hardfaced layers provide lower wear resistance compared to vacuum-deposited hard coatings. One solution to further improve hardfacing performance is a duplex approach, which combines the two processes. This study investigates the following materials: a 316 stainless steel base hardfaced with laser-cladded Co-Cr superalloy and topped with a CVD nanostructured W-WC coating. Tribological properties of three configurations were assessed for their ability to delay initiation of plastic deformation and surface cracking under quasistatic loading and for their resistance to dry reciprocal sliding wear. The results demonstrate that finite element modeling allows numerical prediction and comparison of the load-carrying capacity and wear resistance of duplex-coated AISI 316 stainless steel.

TI Cyclic Oxidation and Hot Corrosion Behavior of Plasma-Sprayed CoCrAlY
   plus WC-Co Coating on Turbine Alloys
SO JOURNAL OF FAILURE ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION
AB Components in energy-producing systems suffer a variety of degradation processes such as oxidation and molten salt-induced corrosion as a consequence of complex multi-component gaseous environment. Coatings provide a composition that will grow the protective scale at high temperatures having long-term stability. Plasma spraying was used to deposit CoCrAlY + WC-Co composite coatings on turbine alloys of Hastelloy X and AISI 321. The thermocyclic oxidation behavior of coated alloys was investigated in static air and in molten salt (Na2SO4-60%V2O5) environment at 700 degrees C. The thermogravimetric technique was used to approximate the kinetics of oxidation in 50 cycles, each cycle consisting of heating and cooling. X-ray diffraction and SEM/EDAX techniques are used to characterize the oxide scale formed. Coated alloys showed a lower corrosion rate as compared to uncoated alloys. The coatings subjected to oxidation and hot corrosion showed slow scale growth kinetics. Preferential oxidation of Co, Cr, W and its spinel blocks the transport of oxygen and corrosive species into the coating by providing a barrier, thereby making the oxidation rate to reach steady state. As compared to the substrate alloys, coatings show better hot corrosion resistance.

AB The aim of the study is characterization of high-temperature oxidation behavior of new Co-based superalloys by thermogravimetry (TG). The following alloys have been taken into account: Co-9Al-9W, Co-20-Ni-7Al-7W, Co-10Al-5Mo-2Nb and Co-20Ni-10Al-5Mo-2Nb (at.%). The thermogravimetric analysis was carried out in the temperature range 40-1200 degrees C of heating rate 5 degrees min(-1). The investigation was performed using the thermal analyzer NETZSCH STA 449 F3 Jupiter. TG-DTG plots showed oxidation behavior up to 1200 degrees C and indicated the temperatures of further isothermal oxidation examinations. The oxidation behavior of basic Co-9Al-9W (at.%) alloy was compared to W-free Co-10Al-5Mo-2Nb and Co-20Ni-10Al-5Mo-2Nb (at.%) alloys. The obtained data showed different oxidation behavior dependably on the type of alloying elements. Moreover, the effect of Ni addition on oxidation performance was determined. The scales grown on Co-base superalloys after thermogravimetry were evaluated by means of scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy.

The investigated CoNi-base superalloy with alloying additions of Ti and Ta exhibits excellent gamma' solves temperature, 1236 degrees C, and high-temperature strength, 622 MPa at 900 degrees C, compared to reported gamma'-strengthening Co-base superalloys. Detailed analyses of the deformation mechanisms for the investigated alloys were carried out by using the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterization. Two different transitions of deformation mechanisms for the gamma' phase, from superpartial dislocation shearing to dislocation bypassing and to stacking fault shear, occurred in the investigated alloys as the deformation temperature increased above the peak temperatures. Meanwhile, the high-temperature strength of the investigated alloys largely decreased as the transitions of deformation mechanism took place. The influence of alloying effects on energies of faults and the relationship between high-temperature strength and deformation mechanisms were discussed.

After consolidation and heat treatment a fine grained microstructure with a high fraction of carbides and a gamma/gamma' microstructure was obtained. The compressive yield strength at room temperature was found to be 45% higher than that of previously reported results for Co-based superalloys. A similar level of strength was found at 700 degrees C. These extraordinary properties can be explained due to the multitude of hardening mechanisms that sintered Co-based superalloys possess: gamma' precipitation, carbide formation and the ultra-fine se-grain size promoted by the fast consolidation technique.

TI Erosion wear characteristics of HVOF Sprayed WC-Co-Cr and CoNiCrAlY
   coatings on IS-2062 structural steel
SO MATERIALS RESEARCH EXPRESS
AB Structural steel components of thermal power plants are exposed to the oxidative and erosive environment during the operation of the plants. Such steels have good structural properties but lack resistance to erosion. Hard coatings are deposited on structural steels to improve their erosion resistance while maintaining good structural properties. The current work emphasizes the role of HVOFsprayed WC-12Co-4Cr and Co-32-Ni-21Cr-8Al-0.5Y coatings on the erosive wear of IS-2062 structural steel. Coatings are evaluated in terms of hardness, erosion rate, adhesion to the substrate, surface roughness and porosity. The erosion tests are carried out using an air jet erosion tester at 30 degrees and 90 degrees impact angles under room temperature environment. From this investigation, it has been observed that WC-Co-Cr coating on IS-2062 structural steel provides better erosion resistance than Co-32-Ni-21Cr-8Al-0.5Y coating at both the impact angles. However, the higher erosion rate is found at 90 degrees impact angle than that at 30 degrees impact angle for both the coatings suggesting a dominating brittle erosion mechanism. Microhardness and surface roughness of the coatings played an important role in the erosion resistance of WC-Co-Cr and CoNiCrAlY coatings.

AB A new polycrystalline gamma'-strengthened cobalt-base superalloy with improved oxidation resistance up to 1100 degrees C is presented. Based on the Co-Al-W-Ni-Cr-Ti system, the chemistry was optimized via computational thermodynamics, and an 18 kg ingot was successfully melted under vacuum and processed. During cyclic oxidation trials at 800 degrees C, 1000 degrees C, and 1100 degrees C, the Co-base superalloy gained significantly less mass per surface area than the benchmark Waspaloy tested in similar conditions. X-ray diffraction and EDS analysis of the oxidized surface showed that a continuous layer of Al2O3 forms between the substrate and the external oxides, providing the necessary oxidation resistance.

TI Tensile Behavior and Evolution of the Phases in the
   Al10Co25Cr8Fe15Ni36Ti6 Compositionally Complex/High Entropy Alloy
SO ENTROPY
AB Compositionally complex alloys, or high entropy alloys, are good candidates for applications at higher temperatures in gas turbines. After their introduction, the equiatomic Al17Co17Cr17Cu17Fe17Ni17 (at.%) served as a starting material and a long optimization road finally led to the recently optimized Al10Co25Cr8Fe15Ni36Ti6 (at.%) alloy, which shows promising mechanical properties. Investigations of the as-cast state and after different heat treatments focus on the evolution of the microstructure and provide an overview of some mechanical properties. The dendritic solidification provides two phases in the dendritic cores and two different ones in the interdendritic regions. Three of the four phases remain after heat treatments. Homogenization and subsequent annealing produce a -' based microstructure, similar to Ni-based superalloys. The phase is Co-Cr-Fe rich and the ' phase is Al-Ni-Ti rich. The understanding of the mechanical behavior of the investigated alloy is supported and enhanced by the study of the different phases and their nanohardness measurements. The observations are compared with mechanical and microstructural data from commercial Ni-based superalloys, Co-based alloys, and Co-Ni-based alloys at the desired application temperature of similar to 800 degrees C.

AB A Co-Ni-based alloy strengthened by gamma'-(L1(2)) precipitates was utilized to investigate the precipitation evolution after various cooling rates and several aging conditions. In this study, the precipitate size and volume fraction have been studied via scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The influence of the precipitation evolution was measured via microhardness tests. The cooling rate study shows a more sluggish gamma' precipitation reaction compared to that observed in a Ni-based superalloy. Following a rapid cooling rate, the application of appropriate double aging treatments allows for the increase of the gamma' volume fraction as well as the control of the size and distribution of the precipitates. The highest hardness values reach those measured on supersolvus cast and wrought Ni-based superalloys. The observed gamma' precipitation behavior should have implications for the production, the heat treatment, the welding, or the additive manufacturing of this new class of high-temperature materials.

AB The effect of Nb on the properties and microstructure of two novel powder metallurgy (P/M) Ni-based superalloys was evaluated, and the results critically compared with the Rolls-Royce alloy RR1000. The Nb-containing alloy was found to exhibit improved tensile and creep properties as well as superior oxidation resistance compared with both RR1000 and the Nb-free variant tested. The beneficial effect of Nb on the tensile and creep properties was due to the microstructures obtained following the post-solution heat treatments, which led to a higher gamma' volume fraction and a finer tertiary gamma' distribution. In addition, an increase in the anti-phase-boundary energy of the gamma' phase is also expected with the addition of Nb, further contributing to the strength of the material. However, these modifications in the gamma' distribution detrimentally affect the dwell fatigue crack-growth behavior of the material, although this behavior can be improved through modified heat treatments. The oxidation resistance of the Nb-containing alloy was also enhanced as Nb is believed to accelerate the formation of a defect-free Cr2O3 scale. Overall, both developmental alloys, with and without the addition of Nb, were found to exhibit superior properties than RR1000.

AB The Al/W ratio was increased in a new polycrystalline gamma/gamma' Co-based superalloy in order to introduce a grain boundary pinning phase while at the same time reducing the density and increasing the oxidation resistance. The grain boundary pinning phase was identified as beta-phase (B2-(Ni,Co)Al) by high-energy X-ray diffraction. The grain boundary pinning effect was confirmed to be effective up to temperatures of 1050 degrees C by synchrotron radiation in-situ heating experiments. The precipitation of the beta phase led to a reduced gamma' volume fraction thereby decreasing the high-temperature strength. The density was lowered to 8.52 g/cm(3), so the specific strength was equivalent to the strength of the reference alloy up to 750 degrees C. Due to the low gamma' volume fraction and the low W content, the creep resistance was also reduced compared with the reference alloy. The oxidation resistance, however, was improved by the formation of a thin, continuous Al-oxide layer during oxidation at 900 degrees C for 50 hours.

AB With the aim of understanding how to further improve the creep resistance of Co-Al-W-base superalloys at higher temperature (> 1223 K), the creep behavior of a novel Co-Al-W-base single-crystal superalloy at 1273 K/137 MPa was systematically investigated. Several interrupted creep tests were performed and the main deformation mechanisms of characteristic creep stages were identified and correlated to both the gamma/gamma' microstructural and dislocation substructural evolutions. Two steady-state creep stages were observed during the creep process. The interfacial dislocations and the formation of rafts were responsible for the first steady-state creep stage, while the second steady-state creep stage could be ascribed to interactions between stacking faults of different slip systems in an inverted gamma/gamma' microstructure, e.g., the formation of Lomer-Cottrell locks by the leading partials of the SFs. The observed creep mechanisms were compared to those typical of Ni-base superalloys at similar creep conditions. It is suggested that a high stacking fault energy of the gamma' phase and a higher gamma' volume fraction may be favorable for creep resistance of Co-Al-W-base single-crystal superalloys by promoting the double steady-state creep phenomenon.

AB Correlative high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy are used to study deformation-induced planar faults in the single-crystal superalloy MD2 crept at 800 degrees C and 650 MPa. Segregation of Cr and Co at microtwins, anti-phase boundaries (APB), and complex/superlattice extrinsic and intrinsic stacking faults (CESF/SESF and CISF/SISF) is confirmed and quantified. The extent of this is found to depend upon the fault type, being most pronounced for the APB. The CESF/SESF is studied in detail due to its role as a precursor of the microtwins causing the majority of plasticity under these conditions. Quantitative modeling is carried out to rationalize the findings; the experimental results are consistent with a greater predicted velocity for the lengthening of the CESF/SESF-compared with the other types of fault-and hence confirm its role in the diffusion-assisted plasticity needed for the microtwinning mechanism to be operative.

TI On the diffusive phase transformation mechanism assisted by extended
   dislocations during creep of a single crystal CoNi-based superalloy
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB We propose here a deformation-induced diffusive phase transformation mechanism occurring during shearing of gamma' ordered phase in a gamma/gamma' single crystalline CoNi-based superalloy. Shearing involved the creation and motion of a high density of planar imperfections. Through correlative electron microscopy and atom probe tomography, we captured a superlattice intrinsic stacking fault (SISF) and its associated moving leading partial dislocation (LPD). The structure and composition of these imperfections reveal characteristic chemical structural contrast. The SISF locally exhibits a D0(19) ordered structure coherently embedded in the L-12 gamma' and enriched in W and Co. Interestingly, the LPD is enriched with Cr and Co, while the adjoining planes ahead of the LPD are enriched with Al. Quantitative analysis of the three-dimensional compositional field in the vicinity of imperfections sheds light onto a new in-plane diffusion mechanism as the LPD moves on specific {111)}evier planes upon application of stress at high temperature.

AB The effect of two base alloys, viz. Ni-based superalloy Rene 80 and Co-based alloy ECY768, on the oxidation and interdiffusion behavior of a NiCoCrAlY Re-containing coating after exposure for up to 2000 h at 1050A degrees C in synthetic air has been evaluated. Scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy was employed to measure the element concentrations, and phases were identified by electron backscatter diffraction. Significant depletion of beta-NiAl within the coating, enrichment of gamma'-phase, and formation of A mu-phase in the alloy and Kirkendall porosity at the coating-alloy interface were observed in the coating on Rene 80. In contrast, the coating on the Co-base alloy ECY768 formed large amounts of Cr/Re-rich carbides and the depletion of beta-NiAl phase was less pronounced than that observed on the Ni-base alloy. These findings could be interpreted using an in-house-developed thermodynamic-kinetic CALPHAD-based computer model.

TI The grain boundary pinning effect of the mu phase in an advanced
   polycrystalline gamma/gamma' Co-base superalloy
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB A grain boundary pinning phase was introduced into a gamma/gamma' Co-base superalloy by the addition of Mo. The intermetallic phase was identified as mu phase (Co,Ni,Cr)(7)(W,Mo)6 by high-energy X-ray diffraction and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy in the transmission electron microscope. Synchrotron radiation insitu heating experiments confirmed the stability of the grain structure up to 1050 degrees C and therefore the grain boundary pinning effect of this phase. Recrystallization heat treatments at different temperatures resulted in varying amounts of mu phase. The grain size analysis revealed that at least 1% of the phase is necessary to maintain a pinning effect during recrystallization. Atom probe tomography confirmed that Mo partitioned predominantly to the gamma phase. Since the mu phase and the gamma' phase are competing for W, a lower gamma volume fraction was formed in comparison to a Mo-free polycrystalline gamma/gamma' Co-base superalloy variant. However, the homogeneous distribution of small grains resulted in a higher strength compared to the Mo-free alloy without grain boundary pinning phases. The creep resistance at 750 degrees C was similar to the Mo-free alloy as well as the polycrystalline Ni-base superalloy U720Li with a creep rate minimum of 1.5 x 10(-7) s(-1) at 620 MPa.

AB Cobalt-based superalloy matrix composite materials were produced through the powder metallurgy technique using element powders at high purity and nano-sized wolfram carbide (WC) reinforcement in this study. An alloy that had the same chemical composition as the Stellite 6 alloy but not containing carbon was selected as the matrix alloy. The powder mixtures obtained as a result of mixing WC reinforcing member and element powders at the determined ratio were shaped by applying 300 MPa of pressure. The green components were sintered under argon atmosphere at 1240 A degrees C for 120 minutes. The densities of the sintered components were determined by the Archimedes' principle. Microstructural characterization was performed via X-ray diffraction analysis, scanning electron microscope examinations, and energy-dispersive spectrometry. Hardness measurements and tensile tests were performed for determining mechanical characteristics. The relative density values of the sintered components increased by increasing the WC reinforcement ratio and they could almost reach the theoretical density. It was determined from the microstructural examinations that the composite materials consisted of fine and equiaxed grains and coarse carbides demonstrating a homogeneous dispersion along the microstructure at the grain boundaries. As it was the case in the density values, the hardness and strength values of the composites increased by increasing the WC ratio.

TI The effects of combining alloying elements on the elastic properties of
   gamma-Ni in Ni-based superalloy: High-throughput first-principles
   calculations
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB Using high-throughput first-principles calculations, we systematically studied the synergistic effect of alloying two elements (Al and 28 kinds of 3d, 4d, and 5d transition metals) on the elastic constants and elastic moduli of gamma-Ni. We used machine learning to theoretically predict the relationship between alloying concentration and mechanical properties, giving the binding energy between the two elements. We found that the ternary alloying elements strengthened the gamma phase in the order of Re > Ir > W > Ru > Cr > Mo > Pt > Ta > Co. There is a quadratic parabolic relationship between the number of d shell electrons in the alloying element and the bulk modulus, and the maximum bulk modulus appears when the d shell is half full. We found a linear relationship between bulk modulus and alloying concentration over a certain alloying range. Using linear regression, we found the linear fit concentration coefficient of 29 elements. Using machine learning to theoretically predict the bulk modulus and lattice constants of Ni32XY, we predicted values close to the calculated results, with a regression parameter of R-2 = 0.99626. Compared with pure Ni, the alloyed Ni has higher bulk modulus B, G, E, C-11, and C-44, but equal C-12. The alloying strengthening in some of these systems is closely tied to the binding of elements, indicating that the binding energy of the alloy is a way to assess its elastic properties.

TI Low cycle fatigue behavior of a high Co polycrystalline nickel-base
   superalloy at 750 degrees C
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Low cycle fatigue (LCF) performance of a novel high Co nickel-base polycrystalline superalloy was investigated at 750 degrees C under the strain ranges from 0.6 to 1.0%. The objective is to focus on fatigue life, cyclic deformation behavior, deformation substructure, fracture mode, crack propagation pathway as well as oxidation attack at the crack tip. The fatigue life decreases with strain range increasing and follow the Coffin-Manson power law with plastic strain. The experimental results show that a transformation from intergranular to transgranular failure was detected using microscopic observation. Post-mortem examination shows that the crack prefers propagating along random high angle boundaries comparing to twin boundaries. It has been evidenced that oxidation damage accumulation at the crack tip can promote intergranular crack propagation. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI gamma plus gamma ' microstructures in the Co-Ta-V and Co-Nb-V ternary
   systems
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB The Co-Ta-V and Co-Nb-V ternary systems are investigated in a search for L1(2)-ordered gamma' precipitation, based on recent computational predictions of stable gamma+gamma' microstructures. Four alloys with nominal (at. %) composition Co-6Ta-6V, Co-5.4Ta-6.6V-xNi (x = 0 and 10), and Co-6Nb-6V are arc-melted, homogenized at 1250 degrees C, and aged at 900 degrees C for 2,16 and 64 h. Nanometric, cuboidal gamma' precipitates within a fcc-gamma matrix are discovered in the Co-Ta-V system after aging for 2 h, and in the Co-Nb-V system after cooling from homogenization. The compositions of these two new gamma'-phases, as measured via atom probe tomography, are Co-3(Ta0.76V0.24) and Co-3(Nb0.65V0.35), respectively. Upon aging at 900 degrees C, the gamma' precipitates coarsen, dissolve and transform to lamellar C36-Co-3(Ta,V) and needle-shape DO19-CO3(Nb,V), measured as Co-3(Nb0.81V0.19) by APT, respectively. This shows that these ternary gamma' phases are metastable and points to the need for their stabilization via additional alloying elements. (C) 2018 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI SEM/TEM Investigation of Aluminide Coating Co-Doped with Pt and Hf
   Deposited on Inconel 625
SO MATERIALS
AB The effect of simultaneous introduction of Hf and Pt into aluminide coating deposited on Inconel 625 alloy was investigated using scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM/TEM) methods. The coating consisted of two layers: the additive and the interdiffusion. The additive layer and part of the interdiffusion layer consist of the -NiAl type phase. The middle part of the interdiffusion layer comprised an interpenetrating finger-like structure formed by the -NiAl and TCP sigma type phases with numerous fine Cr precipitates in the former and occasional larger precipitates of NbC carbides interspersed in between them. The sigma type phase inclusions are situated at the border between the substrate and the interdiffusion layer. The experiment showed that platinum fully dissolves in the -NiAl-type matrix, while most of the introduced hafnium accumulates in HfO2 dioxide precipitates located close to the additive/interdifusion interface.

TI Liquation Cracking in the Heat-Affected Zone of IN738 Superalloy Weld
SO METALS
AB The main scope of this study investigated the occurrence of liquation cracking in the heat-affected zone (HAZ) of IN738 superalloy weld, IN738 is widely used in gas turbine blades in land-based power plants. Microstructural examinations showed considerable amounts of gamma' uniformly precipitated in the gamma matrix. Electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) maps showed the gamma-gamma' colonies were rich in Al and Ti, but lean in other alloy elements. Moreover, the metal carbides (MC), fine borides (M3B2 and M5B3), eta-Ni3Ti, sigma (Cr-Co) and lamellar Ni7Zr2 intermetallic compounds could be found at the interdendritic boundaries. The fracture morphologies and the corresponding EPMA maps confirmed that the liquation cracking in the HAZ of the IN738 superalloy weld resulted from the presence of complex microconstituents at the interdendritic boundaries.

SO CORROSION SCIENCE
AB A study on the individual role of gamma and gamma'-phase during the scale formation on Co-9Al-9W (at.%) at 900 degrees C was conducted. High-accuracy thermogravimetric analysis was used to locate changes in the kinetics of scale growth. Compositions of three separated layers within the scale have been elucidated in detail. The results demonstrate the substantial impact of the two-phase microstructure on the initiation of oxidation for the appearance of the scale. Examination of STEM-EDX elemental mappings of the internal oxidation front during the early stages of scale growth can explain the origin of isolated Al2O3 precipitates instead of a closed protective layer.

TI Influences of Cr and Co on the Growth of Thermally Grown Oxide in
   Thermal Barrier Coating during High-Temperature Exposure
SO COATINGS
AB Thermal barrier coating (TBC) is a critical material in the aerospace domain to increase the lifetime of gas turbine components subjected to thermal load. The properties of TBC are strongly related to the growth of thermally grown oxide (TGO) whose main constituent is Al2O3. However, the oxidation of Cr and Co can affect the growth of TGO, which is not studied sufficiently. In this paper, high-temperature exposure at 1000 degrees C was performed to investigate the effect of Cr and Co oxides on TGO growth. The morphology and composition analysis of the interface between the ceramic top coat and the bond coat (TC/BC) were investigated by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and the energy dispersion spectrum (EDS). The thermodynamics and kinetics of oxidation were analyzed. The results indicated that the oxidation kinetics basically followed the sub-parabolic law with exposure time. Additionally, the major factor affecting the formation of oxides was the diffusion rate at the initial stage of exposure, then oxides depended on thermodynamics, and the oxidation was influenced by both of them in the last stage. The major elements to be oxidized were different at different stages. Moreover, the replacement reaction of Cr2O3 and the phase conversion of Al2O3 resulted in thickness variations of the TGO and Al-depleted zone during high-temperature exposure.

TI Influence of the Starting Microstructure on the Hot Deformation Behavior
   of a Low Stacking Fault Energy Ni-based Superalloy
SO METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND
   MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB The influence of varying fractions of primary gamma prime precipitates on the hot deformation and annealing behavior of an experimental Nickel-based superalloy containing 24 wt pct. Co was investigated. Billets heat treated at 1110 A degrees C or 1135 A degrees C were subjected to hot compression tests at temperatures ranging from 1020 A degrees C to 1060 A degrees C and strain rates ranging from 0.001 to 0.1/s. The microstructures were characterized using electron back scatter diffraction in the as-deformed condition as well as following a super-solvus anneal heat treatment at 1140 A degrees C for 1 hour. This investigation sought to quantify and understand what effect the volume fraction of primary gamma prime precipitates has on the dynamic recrystallization behavior and resulting length fraction a3 twin boundaries in the low stacking fault superalloy following annealing. Although deformation at the lower temperatures and higher strain rates led to dynamic recrystallization for both starting microstructures, comparatively lower recrystallized fractions were observed in the 1135 A degrees C billet microstructures deformed at strain rates of 0.1/s and 0.05/s. Subsequent annealing of the 1135 A degrees C billet microstructures led to a higher proportion of annealing twins when compared to the annealed 1110 A degrees C billet microstructures.

TI Comparative evaluation of hot corrosion resistance of nanostructured
   AlCrN and TiAlN coatings on cobalt-based superalloys
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS RESEARCH
AB Molten vanadate-induced hot corrosion is the major cause of failure of superalloys which are generally used at higher temperatures (such as in internal combustion engines, gas turbines, high temperature tooling and dies, and petrochemical industries and marines). This effect can be minimized by applying thermally stable coatings over the superalloy. In this aspect, the current work investigates the effect of nanostructured aluminum chromium nitride (AlCrN) and titanium aluminum nitride (TiAlN) coatings on the hot corrosion behavior of Co-based superalloy, Superco-605, in an aggressive environment of Na2SO4-60% V2O5 (ratio by weight) at 700 degrees C up to 80 cycles. Each cycle consisted of 1 h heating at 700 degrees C followed by 20 min cooling in an ambient temperature. Hot corrosion kinetics was studied using the thermogravimetric technique and found to follow the parabolic rate law. The corrosion surface morphology and phases formed during hot corrosion were studied using field emission scanning electron microscopy equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction techniques. It was found that AlCrN coating had a better hot corrosion resistance than TiAlN coating.

TI A comparative study to evaluate the corrosion performance of Zr
   incorporated Cr3C2-(NiCr) coating at 900 degrees C
SO CERAMICS INTERNATIONAL
AB In this study zirconium incorporated Cr3C2-(NiCr) coating has been sprayed on three superalloys viz. Superni 718, Superni 600 and Superco 605 using D-gun technique. A comparative study has been carried out to check the cyclic oxidation in air and hot corrosion in simulated incinerator environment (40%Na2SO4-40%K2SO4-10% NaCl-10%KCl) for the coated specimens at 900 degrees C for 100 cycles. Oxidation kinetics has been established for all the specimens using weight change measurements. Corrosion products have been characterized using X-ray diffractometer (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive analysis (SEM/EDAX). Cr3C2-(NiCr) + 0.2%wtZr coating provides very good corrosion resistance in air oxidation for all the three coated superalloys. As all the three coated superalloys shows parabolic behaviour with parabolic rate constant as 0.07 x 10(-10) (g(2) cm(-4) s(-1)) for Superni 718, 0.43 x 10(-10) (g(2) cm(-4) s(-1)) for Superni 600 and 0.3 x 10(-10) (g(2) cm(-4) s(-1)) for Superco 605 This coating is also effective in the molten salt environment but coating on Co-based superalloy Superco 605 did not perform satisfactorily. The parabolic rate constants for coated Superni 718 is 0.61 x 10-10 (g(2) cm(-4) s(-1)), for coated Superni 600 is 6.72 x 10(-1) (g(2) cm(-4) s(-1)) and for coated Superco 605 is 17.5 x 10(-10) (g(2) cm(-4) s(-1)).

TI Multicomponent gamma'-strengthened Co-based superalloys with increased
   solvus temperatures and reduced mass densities
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB Several Co-Al-(W)-based gamma-(FCC)/gamma'-(L1(2)) alloys are investigated to combine recent results indicating significant increases in the gamma'-solvus temperature with additions of Ni, Ta, and Ti, and reduced mass density with the substitution of Mo and Nb for W. A maximum solvus temperature of 1167 +/- 6 degrees C is achieved for an alloy with the composition Co-30Ni-7Al-4Ti-7W-1Ta (mole fraction x 100); while the composition Co-30Ni-7Al-4Ti-3Mo-2W-1Nb-1Ta (L19) exhibits a promising combination of high gamma' volume fraction and solvus temperature, low mass density, and excellent two-phase gamma-gamma'microstructural stability. Atom probe tomographic measurement of L19 aged for 4 hat 900 degrees C indicates that Ni, Al, Ti, W, Nb, and Ta partition preferentially to the gamma'-precipitates while Co partitions strongly to the gamma-matrix. Molybdenum segregates at the gamma/gamma' interface, resulting in a reduction in the interfacial free energy of 1.63 +/- 0.85 mJ m(-2). Decreasing the mole fraction of Ni from 30% to 10% decreases the partitioning of Al and Ti to the gamma'-phase and increases partitioning of Co, Mo, W, Nb, and Ta to the gamma'-phase. From an analysis of coarsening kinetics (Ostwald ripening) at 900 C in Co-xNi-7Al-4Ti-3Mo-2W-1Nb-1Ta (x = 10 and 30) interfacial free energies of 35.0 +/- 18.6 mJ m(-2) and 29.2 +/- 15.5 mJ m(-2) are calculated for mole fractions of Ni of 10% and 30%, respectively. This decrease in interfacial free energy with increasing Ni-concentration is attributed partially to both Mo-segregation at the gamma-gamma' interface and a decrease in the lattice parameter misfit between the gamma'-precipitate and gamma-matrix, and concomitantly the misfit strain energy.

TI Preparation and Enhanced Hot Corrosion Resistance of a Zr-Doped
   PtAl2+(Ni, Pt)Al Dual-Phase Coating
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB Prior to practical service, hot-section components (e.g. airfoils and vanes) of a gas turbine engine are necessarily coated by a protective metallic coating (such as aluminidi diffusion coating, modified aluminide coating and MCrAlY overlay etc.) to resist high temperature oxidation and hot corrosion. Among the modified aluminide coatings, the coating with Pt-modification has attracted great attention and is widely used in applications requiring high reliability and extended service life since it possesses superior oxidation/corrosion resistance at high temperature. The presence of Pt in aluminide coating is favorable for increasing bonding strength of oxide scale, enlarging phase region of beta 3-NiAI and confining detrimental effect of sulphur etc. Although Pt-modification has exhibited visible benefits for acquiring better high-temperature performance, it is far from satisfaction to develop an ideal aluminide diffusion coating. Reactive elements such as Y, Hf, Zr or their oxides have been employed to modify the nickel aluminide coating system, with an aim to further improve scale adhesion and promote exclusive formation of alpha-Al2O3 simultaneously. In this work, a Zr-doped PtAl2+(Ni, Pt)Al dual-phase aluminide coating was prepared on a Ni-based single crystal superalloy by co-deposition of Pt-Zr through electroplating and sub-sequent aluminization treatments The coating was mainly composed of three layers: the outmost layer consisted of double phases with PtAl2 particles dispersed in beta-(Ni, Pt)Al domain, while the interlayer comprised beta-(Ni, Pt)Al with small amount of Cr-precipitates, and the bottom layer was an inter-diffusion zone (IDZ). Zirconium was mainly distributed inside beta-(Ni, Pt)Al solid solution in both the outmost layer and the interlayer. Compared with normal PtAl2+(Ni, Pt)Al dual-phase coating, the hot corrosion behavior of the Zr-doped PtAl2 + (Ni, Pt)Al coating was assessed in a salt mixture of Na2SO4/NaCI (75:25, mass ratio) at 850 degrees C in static air. The results indicated that the Zr-doped PtAl2+(Ni, Pt)Al dual-phase coating exhibited superior hot corrosion resistance since Zr was confirmed able to capture and fix S and CI to diminish their detrimental effects. Meanwhile, a pre-oxidation treatment did not effectively improve the overall hot corrosion resistance of normal PtAl2+(Ni, Pt)Al coating because the thin alumina scale formed during pre-oxidation was unable to prohibit the sustained inward-invasion of the mixed salt.

TI Nickel-Based Single-Crystal Superalloys (Ni, Co)-Al-(Ta, Ti)-(Cr, Mo, W)
   Designed by Cluster-Plus-Glue-Atom Model and Their 1000 h Long-Term
   Ageing Behavior at 900 degrees C
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB It has been pointed out recently that the compositions of industrial alloys are originated from cluster-plus-glue-atom structure units in solid solutions. Specifically for nickel-based superalloys, after properly grouping the alloying elements into Al, Ni-like ((Ni) over bar, including Ni, Co, Fe, Re, Ru and Ir), gamma '- forming Cr-like ((Cr) over bar (gamma '), including Ta, Ti, V, Nb), and gamma-forming Cr-like ((Cr) over bar;(gamma), including Cr, Mo and W), the optimal formula for single-crystal superalloys has been established [Al-(Ni) over bar (12)] (Al-1(Cr) over bar (gamma ')(0.5)(Cr) over bar (gamma)(1.5)). In this work, the first generation single-crystal superalloys were investigated on the basis of the proposed formula, by using (Ni) over bar=(Ni and Co), (Cr) over bar (gamma ')=(Ta and Ti), and (Cr) over bar (gamma)=(Cr, Mo and W). Two series of alloys were designed, formulated respectively as group A: [Al-Ni11Co1] (Al1TaxTi0.5-xCr1W0.25Mo0.25), with x=0, 0.25 and 0.5 (the corresponding mass fractions of Ta and Ti are respectively 0Ta-2.65Ti, 4.82Ta-1.26Ti and 9,32Ta-0Ti), and group B: [Al-Ni12-yCo gamma](Al1Ta0.25Ti0.25Cr1W0.25MO0.25), with y=1.5, 1.75, 2 and 2.5 (the corresponding mass fractions of Co are respectively 9.43Co, 11Co, 12.57Co and 15.71Co). The single-crystal superalloys were prepared using selector technique. And then they underwent the following tests of incipient melting, standard heat treatment and 1000 h long term ageing at 900 degrees C. It is found that: (1) In group A, with increasing Ta content (decreasing Ti), all the incipient melting temperatures are increased to above 1330 degrees C, and to the highest value is between 1335 degrees C and 1340 degrees C for alloy 9.32Ta-0Ti; the gamma(')gamma(') lattice negative misfits after standard heat treatment are reduced from -0.262% (0Ta-2.65Ti) to -0.247% (9.32Ta-0Ti); the gamma(') coarsening tendency after long-term ageing is deduced, and alloy 9.32Ta-0Ti has the lowest coarsening rate (K=5.6x10(-5) mu(3)/h). (2) In group B, the Co content does not influence the incipient melting temperature (always above 1330 degrees C) and the coarsening rate of gamma(') after long-term ageing. The major role of Co is to increase the mean size of the gamma(') precipitates to about 0.55 pm and the gamma(') volume fraction to about 69% after the standard heat treatment. These two groups of alloys have their gamma(') coarsening rates approaching the level of third-generation single-crystal superalloys (K approximate to(2.08 similar to 3.82)*10(-5) mu m(3)/h).

AB Microstructure evolution in Co-20Cr-15W-10Ni alloy with hot deformation and subsequent annealing has been studied using hot isothermal compression at different temperatures and strain rates followed by annealing at 1,423 K for 1 h. In the as-deformed condition, optical microstructure reveals deformation bands in specimens deformed at low temperature (1,323 K) and high strain rate (10 s(-1)). In deformation beyond 1,423 K, very fine recrystallized grains are observed at all the strain rates, which is seen to be fully developed at 1,473 K onwards especially at lower strain rates (0.1 and 0.01 s(-1)). EBSD maps reveal recrystallized grains and presence of deformation twins. Grain growth is observed at strain rate lower than 0.1 s(-1) and temperature more than 1,473 K. After annealing of deformed samples, fully recrystallized grains and annealing twins have been observed. Samples subjected to prior deformation at higher strain rates showed mixed grains with small banding of recrystallized structure, whereas more uniform recrystallized microstructure is observed at slow strain rates. Microhardness decreases with increase in deformation temperature. However, annealed hardness is found to be increasing marginally with decreasing prior deformation temperature (especially for slower strain rates), attributing to relatively uniform and fine microstructure after annealing.

TI Microstructural Evolution of Oxidation Film on a Single Crystal
   Nickel-Based Superalloy at 980 A degrees C
SO OXIDATION OF METALS
AB The isothermal oxidation behavior of a single crystal nickel-based superalloy was investigated at 980 A degrees C through XRD, SEM/EDX and EPMA. The mass gain process exhibited two periods: an initial stage followed by a steady-state stage. Based on the experimental results, the rapid formation of alumina and NiO was responsible for the initial stage of mass gain, and the formation of complex spinels phases may dramatically effect on the steady stage. The microstructure of oxidation film, from the top surface down to the base material, was clarified as Ni-rich oxides, Ni-Cr oxides, Cr-Ta-Co oxides, Ni-Al oxides and finally a continuous Al2O3. In addition, AlN formed in the gamma'-free zone. The effect of oxidation film evolution on the oxidation kinetics and mechanism were discussed.

TI Mechanical and microstructural characterization of MCrAlY coatings
   produced by laser cladding: The influence of the Ni, Co and Al content
SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB Laser metal deposition (LMD) and laser cladding (LC) are alternative methods to thermal spraying processes to produce dense, high-quality coatings. In this work, two MCrAlY coatings (M = Ni + Co) have been prepared onto stainless steel substrate using a coaxial LC technique under two different Ni/Co and Al proportions. The mechanical properties were then evaluated with microhardness, nanoindentation, and three-point bending tests. The microstructure and composition of coatings were characterized by X-ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis and Field Emission Electron Microscopy (FESEM) coupled to an Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) detector. The study revealed that the gamma/beta phases formed in the MCrAIY coating microstructure result in a lower elastic modulus than the austenitic stainless steel substrate, while an inverse behavior for hardness was observed due the presence of the aluminum-rich beta-phase. Under flexural loads, the failure of coatings showed plasticity and anisotropy characteristics depending on the two laser tracks orientations evaluated.

TI Utilization of hot deformation to trigger strain induced boundary
   migration (SIBM) in Ni-base superalloys
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB The effect of strain on the resultant microstructure of an experimental low stacking fault energy Nickel based superalloy containing 24 wt. pct. Co was investigated. Billets subjected to a preliminary heat treatment at 1110 degrees C were compressed to strain limits of 0.15 and 0.5 at strain rates ranging from 0.1/s to 0.01/s and temperatures at 1020 degrees C and 1060 degrees C. The as-deformed microstructures were assessed and characterized using electron backscatter diffraction, as were microstructures corresponding to a super-solvus anneal heat treatment at 1160 degrees C for one hour. This study sought to identify a critical strain limit at which conditions indicative of Strain induced boundary migration (SIBM) could be effectively triggered for the experimental Ni-based super alloy over a set range of thermal-mechanical parameters. Microstructures corresponding to SIBM were then compared to more extensively deformed billets which contained notable fractions of dynamically recrystallized grains to quantify differences in the length fraction and density of Sigma 3 twin boundaries of the respective microstructures. Though billet samples deformed to both 0.15 and 0.5 contained notable magnitudes of stored strain energy, microstructures deformed to 0.15 were noted as having maintained larger length fractions of Sigma 3 twins due to a predominant absence of dynamic recrystallization. Annealed samples originally deformed to 0.15 yielded annealing twin length fractions as high as 59% when compared a sample deformed to the 0.5 strain limit under equivalent thermal-mechanical conditions that resulted in a twin length fraction of 50%. Although samples deformed to the lower strain limit exhibited higher length fractions of annealing twins, samples deformed to the higher strain limit of 0.5 were noted to yield Sigma 3 densities as high as 0.65 mu m(-1), whereas the annealed sample deformed under equivalent thermal-mechanical parameters to the 0.15 strain limit produced Sigma 3 densities as low as 0.32 mu m(-1).

TI Rafting of gamma' precipitates in a Co-9Al-9W superalloy during
   compressive creep
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB The rafting of gamma' precipitates was investigated in a single crystal of Co-9Al-9W(at%) superalloy after compression creep tests at 850 degrees C. Scanning electron micrographs show that the gamma' precipitates raft perpendicular to the compressive stress axis, due to their positive lattice parameter misfit. The rafting of gamma' precipitates occurred after the minimum strain rate was reached. The dislocation structure and stacking faults were investigated by transmission electron microscopy. Dislocations preferentially moved in the horizontal gamma matrix channels where they can relieve the coherency stress at horizontal gamma/gamma' interfaces. After extended periods of creep, rafting of the gamma' precipitates perpendicular to the external compressive stress axis occurred. The merging of gamma' precipitates during rafting initiated at the precipitates corners, leaving pockets of matrix phase in the vertical gamma channels between adjacent gamma' precipitates. The necessary diffusion of alloying elements during the rafting process between the two orientations of matrix channels should be decelerated as diffusion is slower in the ordered L1(2) gamma' phase than in the disordered gamma phase.

TI Creep deformation of Co-Re-Ta-C alloys with varying C
   content-investigated in-situ by simultaneous synchrotron radiation
   diffraction
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB The creep deformation of precipitation hardened Co-Re-Ta-C alloys is investigated during in-situ synchrotron diffraction experiment at 1373 K. At room temperature, the alloys have a structure consisting of epsilon-Co (hcp) and metastably retained gamma-Co (fcc) and are strengthened by precipitates of the mono-carbide of Ta, which are finely dispersed in the alloy matrix. The alloy exhibits an allotropic epsilon -> gamma-Co phase transformation when heating to >1173 K. A lower C content in the alloy generally promotes this transformation. It is shown that this transformation is strongly influenced by application of compressive load. The transformation epsilon -> gamma-Co at high temperature under load leads to microstructure refinement and subsequently to dissolution of hardening precipitates. This results in a considerable acceleration of the creep rate. Further, the equilibrium ratio of gamma/epsilon-Co phase is significantly altered under compressive load. This behavior is attributed to a volume relaxation as the epsilon- and gamma-Co phase have different unit cell volumes.

TI Crack formation and microstructure-sensitive propagation in low cycle
   fatigue of a polycrystalline nickel-based superalloy with different heat
   treatments
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FATIGUE
AB Gas turbine engine materials demand high performance of fatigue life under alternative loading. In this paper, crack initiation and propagation in the low cycle fatigue (LCF) of a polycrystalline nickel based superalloys was studied via experimental and numerical methods. LCF experiments were conducted with the specimens subjected to different heat treatment regimes, including of standard heat treatment (SHT), heat isostatic pressing (HIP), and combined heat treatment (HIP + SHT). Simulations based on finite element method (FEM) were implemented with the 3D digital model obtained from synchrotron radiation X-ray computerized tomography (CT) to investigate the effect of microporosity. Results indicated that microporosity was a dominant factor of fatigue crack and the parameters of microporosity including of porosity, effective diameter, and distribution co-contributed to affect fatigue life. The delta stack and carbide were observed to be fatigue crack sites. The HIP specimen had long fatigue cycle life since casting pore and acicular delta were eliminated, while further SHT can reintroduce delta into matrix resulting in high strength and low fatigue life. LCF crack behaviors in HIP + SHT superalloy depended on surface quality, stress concentration, and the quantity of carbide.

TI Effects of process parameters of vacuum pre-oxidation on the
   microstructural evolution of CoCrAlY coating deposited by HVOF
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB The CoCrAlY coatings deposited using the high velocity oxygen fuel process (HVOF) onto the Inconel 718 superalloy were employed by three different vacuum pre-oxidation heat treatments, and subsequently, the specimens were subjected to isothermal oxidation exposure testing in air at 1050 degrees C for up to 100 h. The spinel oxides were found in the CoCrAlY coatings during the high velocity oxygen fuel process, and subsequently, after isothermal oxidation exposure in air, both the spinel and CoO oxides were formed in the TGO of the NVHT specimen. The evolution of both the phase transformation and the thermally grown oxides' (TGO) growth rate could be significantly influenced by adjusting certain process parameters of vacuum pre-oxidation heat treatments. The TGO of the VHT specimen was predominantly composed of theta-Al2O3 and alpha-Al2O3; however, Co(Cr, Al)(2)O-4 and alumina were observed in the TGO of the VHT950 and VHT1000 specimens. The theta-Al2O3 to alpha-Al2O3 phase transformation in the TGO of the VHT specimen could be delayed after isothermal oxidation exposure. The TGO growth rate was significantly suppressed after the vacuum pre-oxidation heat treatments, and the order of the TGO growth rate was as follows: NVHT<VHT950<VHT<VHT1000. The tensile stress at the alumina area of the TGO in the VHT and VHT950 specimens reduced considerably compared to that in the NVHT specimen, and finally, for the VHT1000 specimen, the tensile stress turned to compressive stress. The elemental interdiffusion behaviour between the HVOF-coating and nickel-based superalloy was characterized, and the diffusion activation energy of cobalt, aluminium and chromium were attempted to be estimated.

TI Microstructure prediction of TMW-4M3 during heat treatment
SO COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB The calculation model on the basis of multi-phase-field model, coupled with the calculation of phase diagram (CALPHAD) approach and classical nucleation theory (CNT) model, was studied for the precipitation behavior of gamma' precipitates in Ni-Co base superalloy TMW-4M3 ("TMW" is a trademark of National Institute for Materials Science registered in Japan) during the heat treatment process. This alloy is precipitation strengthened by gamma', and thus the control of size and distribution of gamma' precipitates is very important for practical applications. Precipitation behavior of gamma' in TMW-4M3 is strongly influenced by heat treatment conditions. Therefore, numerical simulation is useful for finding the most appropriate manufacturing condition prior to experimental trial and error approach. Firstly, we investigated the gamma' solvus temperature and improved several thermodynamic parameters of the conventional database to obtain reasonable phase boundaries between gamma/eta (Ni3Ti) and gamma/gamma'. Based on the new thermodynamic description, the nucleation rates related to temperature histories were calculated by using the CNT with composition balance equation under subsolvus solution treatment. Finally, the multi-phase-field method coupled with the CALPHAD approach and CNT model was applied to the microstructure evolution of intragranular secondary gamma' particles. The experimental and simulated microstructures show good agreement with each other. This method might be useful for microstructure evolution prediction of gamma/gamma' dual phase during the heat-treatment. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Kinetics pathway of precipitation in model Co-Al-W superalloy
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB The early stages of precipitation of the gamma' phase in a model Co based superalloy (Co-9.1Al-7W (at.%)) have been investigated at 900 degrees C using electron microscopy and atom probe tomography. Nucleation, growth and coarsening stages have been studied with a focus on the temporal evolution of the precipitate composition in the light of recent theoretical developments on phase separation in multicomponent alloys. The experimental data have been confronted to the theories of nucleation and coarsening recently developed for such alloys, which are valid for non-ideal and non-dilute systems, and predict the temporal evolution of both the matrix and precipitate compositions. The rate constant for the mean size evolution of the particles, as derived from experiments, has been compared to the one predicted by the mentioned coarsening theory that accounts for a more accurate description of the thermodynamics of the phases, as compared with more classical approaches. From this comparison the gamma/gamma' interfacial energy was derived and found equal to similar to 48 mJ/m(2) The exponents for the temporal evolution of average particles size, number of particles per unit volume were found identical to those for binary alloys during the coarsening regime, as expected, and the temporal evolutions of compositions in both gamma and gamma' phases were found to evolve as predicted by theory. Indeed, the W content in the particles, measured from atom probe tomography (APT) experiments, was found to significantly decrease with time and the observed evolution is remarkably well described by the theory and therefore is shown to originate from the competition between diffusion and capillarity.

TI Microstructure and lifetime of Hf or Zr doped sputtered NiAlCr bond
   coat/7YSZ EB-PVD TBC systems
SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB NiAlCr-X overlay coatings deposited by magnetron sputtering on IN100 and CMSX-4 superalloys and thereafter top-coated with 7YSZ thermal barrier coatings by EB-PVD were investigated with emphasis on the effects of superalloy type and Hf or Zr doping. The sputtered films in the "as coated" condition (after EB-PVD deposition) showed strong diffusion effects of different elements from the superalloys. The measured phase content of beta and gamma' was in good agreement with calculated data obtained from experimental compositions normalized to a Ni-Al-Cr system following the guidelines of site preference of ternary alloying elements. Microstructure evolution and failure characteristics after furnace cyclic tests at 1100 degrees C were investigated as well. The lifetime of the coatings is equivalent to standard MCrAlY TBCs systems and is compared to PtAl and NiCoCrAlY coatings from literature. The effects of microstructure and elements diffusing from the substrates into the bond coat (Ti, Co, Mo and Ta) in combination with the effect of Hf- or Zr-doping is presented and discussed.

TI Influence of Atomizing Gas and Cooling Rate on Solidification
   Characterization of Nickel-based Superalloy Powders
SO RARE METAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING
AB Nickel-based superalloy powders have been produced by high pressure argon gas and nitrogen gas atomization, separately. The microstructural characterization of nickel-based alloy powders has been performed by a scanning electron microscope equipped with an EDS microanalysis unit. Based on a Newtonian cooling model, the flight speed and the cooling rate of two kinds of alloy droplets were calculated. The results show that the droplet cooling rate, which depends on atomization medium and droplet size, has an effect on the solidification microstructure. For argon-gas atomized powders, the developed dendrite structure is predominant at a lower cooling rate and a mixed microstructure composed of dendrite structure and cellular structure is observed at a higher cooling rate. For nitrogen-gas atomized powders, the dendrite structure is predominant at a lower cooling rate and a full cellular structure can be observed at a higher cooling rate. According to calculation, the cooling rate of argon-gas atomized droplets is in a range from 1.0x10(5) K.s(-1) to 4.24x10(6) k.s(-1), while the cooling rate of nitrogen-gas atomized droplets is from 1.0x10(5) K.s(-1) to 4.8x10(6) K.s(-1). The cooling rate increases with decreasing of droplets diameter. Two kinds of atomizing gases have a slight influence on the cooling rate of droplets. The dendrite axis is rich in elements such as Cr, Co, W, Ni and Al while the inter-dendrite region is rich in Ti element.

TI High-Temperature Structural Stabilities of Ni-Based Single-Crystal
   Superalloys Ni-Co-Cr-Mo-W-Al-Ti-Ta with Varying Co Contents
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA-ENGLISH LETTERS
AB It has been recently pointed out that the compositions of industrial alloys are originated from cluster-plus-glueatom structure units in solid solutions. Specifically for Ni-based superalloys, after properly grouping the alloying elements into Al, Ni-like ((Ni) over bar), gamma'-forming Cr-like ((Cr) over tilde (gamma')) and gamma-forming Cr-like ((Cr) over bar (gamma)), the optimal formula for single-crystal superalloys is established [ Al-(Ni) over bar (12)](Al-1(Cr) over bar (gamma')(0.5) (Cr) over bar (gamma)(1.5)). The Co substitutions for Ni at the shell sites are conducted on the basis of the first-generation single-crystal superalloy AM3, formulated as [Al-Ni12-xCox](Al1Ti0.25Ta0.25Cr1W0.25Mo0.25), with x = 1.5, 1.75, 2 and 2.5 (the corresponding weight percents of Co are 9.43, 11.0, 12.57 and 15.71, respectively). The 900 degrees C long-term aging follows the Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner theory (LSW theory), and the Co content does not have noticeable influence on the coarsening rate of gamma'. The microstructure and creep behavior of the four (001) single-crystal alloys are investigated. The creep rupture lifetime is reduced as Co increases. The alloy with the lowest Co (9.43 Co) shows the longest lifetime of about 350 h at 1050 degrees C/120 MPa, and all the samples show N-type rafting after creep tests.

TI An investigation on the tribological properties of Co(ReO4)(2)/MoS2
   composite as potential lubricating additive at various temperatures
SO MATERIALS RESEARCH EXPRESS
AB The Co(ReO4)(2) powder was fabricated via the aqueous solution method, and mixed with MoS2 powder using ball milling technique. A certain concentration of Co(ReO4)(2)/MoS2 composite additive was dispersed into the poly alpha olefin base oil with the assistance of surface active agents. The loadcarrying property and lubricating behavior of base oil containing a certain content of Co(ReO4)(2)/MoS2 composite additive at various temperatures were evaluated by four-ball test and ball-on-disc sliding friction test. The physical properties and friction-reducing mechanism of synthesized composite were ascertained by a series of characterization techniques including X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and differential thermal analysis/thermogravimetry. The four-ball test results suggested the Co(ReO4)(2)/MoS2 composite additive could effectively promote the load-carrying capacity of base oil, and decrease the friction coefficient as well as wear scar diameter. Ball-on-disc sliding friction test results showed that the base oil with Co(ReO4)(2)/MoS2 composite additive possessed lower friction coefficients than that of base oil in the whole temperature range, particularly at high temperatures. The protective layer consisted of composite additive and native oxides from superalloy substrate formed on the worn surface to prevent the direct contact between friction pair. The Co(ReO4)(2)/MoS2 composite played a dominant role in friction-reducing function in the protective layer at elevated temperatures, and the reason for this was that MoS2 possessed layered structure and superior adsorption capacity, and Co(ReO4)(2) had experienced thermal softening with elevated temperatures and maintained shear-susceptible hexagonal structure.

TI Surface Condition of New gamma-gamma ' Co-Al-Mo-Nb and Co-Al-W
   Cobalt-Based Superalloys After Oxidation at 800 degrees C
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING AND PERFORMANCE
AB A new type gamma-gamma' Co-Al-Mo-Nb Co-based superalloys were developed due to limitations of basic Co-Al-W superalloys, related to tungsten alloying. The present study aims to characterization of new gamma-gamma' Co-10Al-5Mo-2Nb (at.%) cobalt-based superalloy performance in terms of the high-temperature exposure under cyclic conditions, with particular regard to surface condition. Specimens were tested in cycles of high-temperature exposition (25, 50, 75, 100 and 150 h) in air environment at 800 A degrees C. Detailed analysis of oxidized surfaces by scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction was made at various intervals during testing. The cyclic oxidation behavior of new alloy was compared to the basic Co-9Al-9W (at.%) Co-based superalloy.

TI Effect of bonding time and homogenization heat treatment on the
   microstructure and mechanical properties of the transient liquid phase
   bonded dissimilar GTD-111/FSX-414 TLP superalloys
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Dissimilar transient liquid phase joints were fabricated between Ni-based GTD-111 and Co-based FSX-414 superalloys using a 50 mu m thick amorphous Ni-Si-B interlayer. The athermally solidified zone in the middle of joint contained the ternary eutectic of gamma/Ni3B/Ni6Si2B and few amounts of Ni3Si. The amount of eutectic phase was decreased by increasing the bonding time. The complete isothermal solidification was obtained at the joining time of 100 min. The completion of isothermal solidification was controlled by several factors including the diffusion of Si and B from the bonding zone into the base metals, the diffusion of Ti, Al, Co and Cr from the base metals into the bonding zone and proportional re-distribution of them throughout the joint. The width of bonded zone (about 80 mm) was greater than the thickness of interlayer due to the coupled diffusion and dissolution phenomena. After the homogenization heat treatment, an increase of 34% in shear strength of the joint was observed due to the uniform distribution of strengthening precipitates across the bonding area.

AB A novel polycrystalline nickel-based superalloy SLZhS-1R, heavily alloyed with Co+W and intended as a structural material for turbine blades in gas turbine engines, has been studied. The initial cast superalloy was prepared by vacuum induction melting in the form of an ingot with a size of empty set 100x180 mm. Compression and tensile tests were performed for the cast condition. Before compression testing, the superalloy was subjected to homogenization and heterogenization annealing, which led to an improvement of chemical homogeneity and coagulation of gamma' precipitates. As a result, the flow stresses during compression at elevated temperatures were reduced as compared to those obtained for the as-cast condition. Before the tensile testing, the superalloy was subjected to homogenization annealing (solution treatment) followed by air cooling and ageing. This improved the chemical homogeneity and led to the formation of fine gamma' precipitates with a size in the range of 0.1-0.2 mu m. The obtained mechanical properties in tension were compared with those of the typical cast superalloy ZhS6U.

AB In this study, the microstructure of the bond coat of the YSZ/NiCrAlCo-Y2O3 systems after isothermal oxidation was examined. The ceramic top coating (YSZ) and bond coat (NiCrAlCo-Y2O3) were manufactured by atmospheric plasma spraying (APS) process and were sprayed onto Inconel 718 superalloy. The thickness of the NiCrAlCo-Y2O3 bond coat was 140 +/- 10 mu m. Isothermal oxidation tests were performed at 1050 degrees C during 100 and 200 h in static air. The thermally grown oxide (TGO) layer was formed at the interface between the top coat and the bond coat as a consequence of the isothermal oxidation tests. Cross-section samples after isothermal oxidation were evaluated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The analysis of EDS was performed to the TGO and the lamellas of bond coat near to the TGO. The results showed that the TGO layer was composed mainly of chromium and oxygen as resulting from its diffusion and oxidation. The analysis of the lamellas near to the TGO showed elements such as Ni, Cr, and Co, which are related to the chemical composition of the bond coat. Additionally, Inconel 718 alloys constituents such as Fe and Nb were found in the same area as the result of the diffusion of these elements through the bond coat.

TI Nano-twinning in a precipitate strengthened Ni-based superalloy
SO MATERIALS RESEARCH LETTERS
AB Twinning has been found to be a dominate mechanism in the precipitate strengthened Ni-based superalloys during service at intermediate temperatures. Here, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and atomistic simulations have been combined to show that the twin nucleation process can be facilitated by Co replacing a fraction of Al in the precipitates, due to the negative binding energy of Co-Co atoms. The study further reveals that the presence of Co promotes a new twinning pathway featured with nucleation of one complex stacking fault (CSF) on the middle plane in between two separated CSFs. IMPACT STATEMENTWe demonstrate that Co in the precipitates promotes a new twinning pathway featured with nucleation of one CSF on the middle plane between two separated CSFs.

AB Two cast and heat-treated NbC and TaC - strengthened cobalt superalloys have been developed for an investment casting of spinner discs for glass wool industry. In this work constant load creep tests in tension were carried out in argon atmosphere at three testing temperature 900, 950 and 1000 degrees C and at the initial applied stresses ranging from 40 to 200 MPa. All the tests were continued until the final fracture. The results of creep testing were combined with microstructural and fractographic examinations by means of light and scanning electron microscopy. A mutual comparison of creep characteristics of the investigated superalloys under comparable creep loading conditions showed that NbC-strengthened superalloy exhibited longer creep life than TaC-strengthened one. Further, it was found that carbide precipitation is the primary strengthening mechanism in both cobalt-base superalloys under investigation and the amount, morphology and type of carbides have the decisive effect on the creep properties including creep damage and fracture processes. By contrast, CoNb superalloy exhibited a more brittle character of creep fracture mode than CoTa superalloy due to a premature fracture. This study was initiated to investigate in more details operating creep deformation processes and the effect of the creep microstructure and damage evolution on both investigated superalloys. The different behaviour and properties of studied superalloys were explained based on the received results of this study.

AB NiCr19Co6W10Ti3AlB alloy is a kind of precipitation hardening nickel-base superalloy, also is a kind of high temperature and high elasticity alloy. The chemical elements of the alloy composition is very complex, it includes more than 4.5% aging strengthening elements of Al and Ti, and nearly 37% solid solution strengthening elements of Cr, W, Co etc. Because of composition segregation in the alloy ingot, the difficulty of hot working is faced. In this paper, the composition segregation and homogenization annealing process of cast NiCr19Co6W10Ti3AlB alloy were studied. The dendrite segregation and its elimination method were investigated by homogenization annealing experiment. High temperature plastic deformation behavior of NiCr19Co6W10Ti3AlB alloy was also studied in this paper. By thermal simulation compression test, the thermal deformation behavior and microstructure change under different deformation conditions were analyzed, which provides a good reference for practical production.

AB Ni-based superalloy is widely used for high performance components in power generation turbine due to its excellent mechanical properties. However, Ni-based superalloy has low oxidation resistantance. Therefore, surface coating is required to improve oxidation resistance at high temperatures. Al-Si as a coting material was successfully co-deposited on Nibased substrate by pack cementation method at 900 degrees C for about 4 hours. The oxidation test was carried out at high temperature of 1000 degrees C for 100 hours. Micro structural characterization and analysis on crystal orientation were perfomed by using Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FE-SEM) and Electron Back Scatter Diffraction (EBSD) technique, respectively. The results showed that the coating layer with a homogenous layer and had a thickness of 53 mu m consisting of beta-NiAl with cubic structure and Ni2Al3 with hexagonal structure. TGO layer was developed after oxidation and had a thickness of about 5 mu m consisting of alpha-Al2O3 and spinel NiCr2O4. The phase composition map and crystal orientation acquired by EBSD technique was also discussed both in TGO and coating layers.

AB The L21-structure Fe2AlTi intermetallic compound is one of the two phases identified in Fe-Al-Ti superalloy nanocomposites. Experimental data related to low-temperature magnetic properties of this Heusler compound indicate that magnetic moment is about 0.1 Bohr magneton per formula unit. In contrast, previous quantum-mechanical calculations predicted Fe2AlTi to have much higher magnetic moment, 0.9 Bohr magneton per formula unit. In order to solve this discrepancy between the theory and experiment we have performed a series of quantum-mechanical fix-spin-moment calculations and compared our results with those for non-magnetic state. It turns out that the total energy of the non-magnetic state is only by 10.73 meV/atom higher than that of the magnetic state. When applying Boltzmann statistics to this very small energy difference we predict that the non-magnetic state appears at non-zero temperatures with significant probabilities (for instance, 22.36 % at T = 100 K) and reduces the overall magnetic moment. As another mechanism lowering the magnetization we studied selected shape deformations, in particular trigonal shearing. Fe2AlTi exhibits a compression-tension asymmetry with respect to these strains and, for example, the strain epsilon=-0.08 destabilizes the spin-polarized state, leaving the non-magnetic state as the only stable one.

AB The oxidation tests of the Nimonic 263 alloy exposed to deaerated supercritical water at 600-700 degrees C under 25 MPa were carried out for up to 1000 h. Oxidation rate increased with an increase in temperature. The microstructure and phase composition of oxide scale were analysed by scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. It can be seen that a complex oxide structure formed on the surface of Nimonic 263 including an outer layer of Ni-Fe/Ni-Cr spinel oxide, Ni/Co hydroxide and TiO2 and an inner layer of a mixture of NiCr2O4 and Cr2O3 while the innermost layer is made up of Cr2O3. The MoO3 can be observed at 600 degrees C but disappeared with the increasing temperature. The growth mechanism of oxide scale was discussed.

TI Novel Co-Ti-V-base superalloys reinforced by L1(2)-ordered gamma' phase
SO INTERMETALLICS
AB The influences of alloying elements Al and Ni to a Co-Ti-V master alloy on microstructures, phase stabilities and high-temperature mechanical properties have been investigated. A two-phase microstructure gamma/gamma' with ultrahigh gamma' volume fraction was designed in the Co-Ti-V (master alloy), Co-Ti-V-Al (Al-modified) and Co-Ti-V-Ni (Ni-modified) alloys. Al shows a slight tendency to partition into gamma', while Ni exhibits almost equal distribution between the gamma and gamma' phases. Al is found to increase the volume fraction and solvus temperature of gamma'. The solvus temperatures of gamma' in the master alloy, Al-modified and Ni-modified alloys exceed that of Co-9Al-9W alloy (1000 degrees C) by 91, 112 and 82 degrees C, respectively. The flow stresses of the designed alloys exhibit an anomalous positive dependence on temperature rising from 600 to 750 degrees C. The strengths of the master alloy and Ni-modified alloys are not only higher than that of traditional Co-base superalloy MAR-M 302 at the temperature ranging from 700 to 1000 degrees C, but also comparable with that of the commercial Ni-base superalloy IN-939 between 850 and 1000 degrees C. In conclusion, the present Co-Ti-V-base alloys reinforced by gamma' are suggested as potential candidates for high-temperature utilizations.

TI Alumina formation and microstructural changes of aluminized CoNiCrAlY
   coating during high temperature exposure in the temperature range 925
   degrees C-1075 degrees C
SO MATERIALS AT HIGH TEMPERATURES
AB MCrAlY (M = Ni, Co) coatings are commonly used on gas-turbine components as oxidation resistant overlay coatings and bondcoats for thermal barrier systems. In the present work the microstructural features and oxidation behavior of an aluminized Co-base MCrAlY-coating on a Ni-based superalloy have been investigated in the temperature range 925-1075 degrees C. Microstructural studies of the oxidized coatings by SEM/EBSD were complemented with numerical thermodynamic calculations using the software package ThermoCalc. In the as-received condition the outer part of the coating consisted mostly of beta-(Ni,Co)Al. Formation of sigma-CoCr was observed at the interface between the beta-layer and the inner initial CoNiCrAlY. During high-temperature air exposure alumina based surface scales were formed but the oxidation induced Al depletion of the aluminized coating did not result in formation of the gamma'-(Ni3Al) phase. Rather, the subscale formation of Co/Cr-rich phases was observed and a direct transformation of beta- into gamma-Ni phase after longer times. It is expected that these subscale microstructural changes thus affect the alumina formation and growth as well as the critical aluminum depletion in a different manner as in the case of corresponding beta-NiAl coatings, although a direct comparison between various coating systems was not possible on the basis of the present results.

TI Influence of High Current-Density Impulses on the Stress-Strain Response
   and Microstructural Evolution of the Single Crystal Superalloy CMSX-4
SO MATERIALS RESEARCH-IBERO-AMERICAN JOURNAL OF MATERIALS
AB Owing to the low formability of single-crystal nickel-based materials, single-crystal components are typically cast. Subsequently, a multi-stage heat treatment is carried out in order to partially compensate the dendrite segregation and to stabilize the precipitated gamma'-phase. Such components possess a high resistance to creep at elevated temperatures. Since it is known that electrical impulses can be used to increase the formability of various materials, the potential of an electrical high current-density impulse treatment was evaluated for forming of the high strength nickel-based superalloy CMSX-4. Heat treated and pre-deformed specimens were loaded in compression and subjected to short pulses with a high-current density of 2.3 kA/mm(2). Depending on the microstructural state, the material demonstrated work hardening or softening as a consequence of the impulse treatment. In addition, experiments were carried out on crept specimens to test whether the current-impulse treatment can be used to reverse creep-related segregation of alloying elements (raft formation). It was possible to observe a change in the concentration of the elements in the gamma/ gamma'-phase transition following the current-impulse treatment. In particular, a local increase in the gamma-forming elements Cr, Co and a decrease in the gamma'-forming elements Ta, Ti was observed after the impulse treatment.

AB Tensile properties, deformation and flow behaviour of Ni base superalloy, Nimonic C-263, was studied at modified solutionizing and aging condition, in the temperature range of 25-650 degrees C and at a strain rate of 1.3x10(-3)S(-1). The presence of Dynamic strain aging (DSA) behaviour was observed at a wide temperature regime of 200 degrees C to 600 degrees C. Also an anomalous variation in tensile properties was observed in the temperature ranges between 400 degrees C to 650 degrees C. The yield strength (Y.S) was decreased slightly with temperature up to 300 degrees C and from there, there is a peak in YS at 400 degrees C with minimum(%) of elongation and strain hardening rate is maximum at 400 degrees C. An attempt has been done in this paper, to Co-relate the mechanical properties and flow behaviour of the alloy with microstructral studies and flow equations at different temperatures. It is observed that Ludwigson equation provides the best fit at high temperature, at 650 degrees C, compared to Hollomon and Ludwik equations. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we will study the co-precipitation kinetics of phases in Superalloy 718 using the simulation tool we have developed using the CALPHAD approach. This tool considers concurrent nucleation, growth and coarsening of these precipitates. Furthermore, it is directly integrated with thermodynamic calculation engine to obtain instant update of phase information, such as the composition of the matrix and the nucleation driving force for each precipitate. In addition to the average particle size, the more advanced KWN (Kampmann and Wagner Numerical) model was implemented to allow for predication of the full evolution of the particle size distribution (PSD). In this paper, we will perform virtual experiments using this tool to simulate the co-precipitation of the gamma ' and gamma '' phases under different heat treatment conditions. Simulation results, such as temporal evolution of volume fraction, number density, and mean size of the precipitates, as well as the final particle size distribution will be presented and discussed. The impact of delta precipitate and the initial microstructure will also be briefly discussed. These virtual experimental results can be used to understand the microstructural features of Superalloy 718 and serve as guidance for further optimization of heat treatment schedule.

AB VDM Alloy 780 Premium is a new 718-type superalloy recently developed in a cooperation between Technical University Braunschweig and VDM Metals GmbH [1, 2]. It contains the gamma'-phase for strengthening in addition to a second phase, in the following referred to as delta-phase (Note that determination of the crystal structure is pending. It may not have the same DOa structure as the delta-phase in Alloy 718.). As in Alloy 718, the delta-phase may be used for grain refinement and strengthening of grain boundaries at elevated temperatures. Most important differences in chemical composition compared to Alloy 718 are the essential replacement of Fe by about 25% Co and a higher Al-content (about 2%) in combination with a lower Ti-content (about 0.2%). Firstly, these measures stabilize the strengthening phase and allow for application temperatures of up to 750 degrees C. Secondly, the delta-phase is preserved despite the relatively high aluminum content. To make best use of Alloy 780, the precipitation kinetics of both phases along with the concurrent evolution of microstructure and mechanical properties must be understood. Consequently, this article deals with the influence of heat treatments on the phase kinetics, microstructure evolution and mechanical properties. Firstly, it will be demonstrated that proper control of the heat treatment parameters allows for a distribution of the delta-phase as in Alloy 718. Secondly, Vickers hardness testing along with creep rupture experiments will be presented, revealing interdependencies between heat treatment strategies and mechanical properties. At ambient temperature, the strength of the new alloy meets or exceeds that of Alloy 718 despite absence of the gamma ''-phase, while its creep strength is far superior.

TI Cavitation erosion behaviour and mechanism of HVOF-sprayed
   NiCrBSi-(Cr3C2-NiCr) composite coatings
SO SURFACE ENGINEERING
AB NiCrBSi-(Cr3C2-NiCr) coatings were prepared by high velocity oxy-fuel (HVOF) thermal spraying technique, and their cavitation erosion behaviour was investigated by a magnetostrictive cavitation method. It was observed that in the initial 8 h, cavitation occurred at higher rate, and cumulative mass loss of the two coatings was apparently higher than that of the substrate. Conversely, beyond 12 h, the former was lower than the later, indicating that the coatings depressed the cavitation erosion effectively. This study verified that the cavitation is due to mechanical shock, turbulence of liquid with bubbles and residual stresses, and therefore the formation of cracks and the delamination of coating are induced. Furthermore, an increase in the number of pores results in an increase in damage to the coatings, taking this into account distributions of pores can be termed as a key factor in determining the resistance of cavitation damage.

TI Analysis of service condition of large hot forging die and refabrication

   superalloy and a ferrous alloy
SO JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING PROCESSES
AB Large forming load at high temperature causes the occurrences of plastic deformation, wear, mechanical fatigue, and thermal fatigue in the large hot forging dies and resulted in their short service lives. In this study, temperature field, stress field, and wear condition of large hot forging die were predicted and evaluated by finite element modelling (FEM) analysis. Corroborated by the experimental results, analysis results demonstrated that failures mainly occurred in bridge, boss, and groove regions of the large hot forging dies. According to the analysis and experimental results, the failed large hot forging dies were refabricated by bimetal-layer weld surfacing technology with a cobalt-based superalloy (Co03) and a ferrous alloy (JXHC15). No failure was observed on these refabricated dies, after production of 25 pieces. In comparison with the conventional fabrication or prefabrication methods, this bimetal-layer weld surfacing technology reduced the fabrication cost, shortened the fabrication cycle, and elongated the service lives of large hot forging die effectively.

TI Strengths and Microstructure of SUS316L Fabricated by Selective Laser
   Melting
SO MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS
AB The additive manufacturing (AM) process, which can produce highly complex components, has been getting significant attention in both industry and academic research. Ti-based alloys, Ni-based superalloys, and Co-Cr-based alloys have been widely investigated. However, as Ni-based superalloys have precipitated phases such as the gamma' and gamma '' phases, and Ti-based alloys and Co-Cr-based alloys are multiphase alloys which have phase transformation, it is difficult to clarify the factors in the AM process that in fluence the strength of these alloys. In this study, SUS316L stainless steel, which is a single-phase solid-solution alloy and does not have precipitated phases, was used to investigate the effect of specific factors in the AM process on anisotropy or mechanical properties, and the strengthening mechanism in the AM process in comparison with SUS316L plastic-forming (PF) material. The AM SUS316L was fabricated by selective laser melting using an ytterbium fiber laser from fine metallic powder. We found that the coarse columnar grains grew up along the built direction and the dislocation cell structures which were induced during the AM process into the AM material. During the solution heat treatment, dislocation recovery was observed. The AM specimens showed higher tensile and creep strength compared with the conventional material (the PF material) because of the high dislocation density. The ductility of the AM specimens was lower than that of the conventional material because of defects caused by a lack of fusion at the molten pool boundaries. Furthermore, the specimens whose loading direction corresponds to the built direction showed lower strength and elongation than the specimens whose loading direction was perpendicular to the built direction due to the oriented defects.

TI Preparation and Isothermal Oxidation Behavior of Zr-Doped, Pt-Modified
   Aluminide Coating Prepared by a Hybrid Process
SO COATINGS
AB To take advantage of the synergistic effects of Pt and Zr, a kind of Zr-doped, Pt-modified aluminide coating has been prepared by a hybrid process, first electroplating a Pt layer and then co-depositing Zr and Al elements by an above-the-pack process. The microstructure and isothermal oxidation behavior of the coating has been studied, using a Pt-modified aluminide coating as a reference. Results showed that the Zr-doped, Pt-modified aluminide coating was primarily composed of beta-(Ni,Pt)Al phase, with small amounts of PtAl2- and Zr-rich phases dispersed in it. The addition of Zr diminished voids on the coating surface since Zr could hinder the growth of beta-NiAl grains. It also helped to increase the spalling resistance of the oxide scale and reduce the oxidation rate, which made the Zr-doped, Pt-modified aluminide coating possess better oxidation resistance than the reference Pt-modified aluminide coating at the temperature of 1100 degrees C.

TI Design of Novel Precipitate-Strengthened Al-Co-Cr-Fe-Nb-Ni High-Entropy
   Superalloys
SO METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND
   MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB A series of non-equiatomic Al-Co-Cr-Fe-Nb-Ni high-entropy alloys, with varying levels of Co, Nb and Fe, were investigated in an effort to obtain microstructures similar to conventional Ni-based superalloys. Elevated levels of Co were observed to significantly decrease the solvus temperature of the gamma' precipitates. Both Nb and Co in excessive concentrations promoted the formation of Laves and NiAl phases that formed either during solidification and remained undissolved during homogenization or upon high-temperature aging. Lowering the content of Nb, Co, or Fe prevented the formation of the eutectic type Laves. In addition, lowering the Co content resulted in a higher number density and volume fraction of the gamma' precipitates, while increasing the Fe content led to the destabilization of the gamma' precipitates. Various aging treatments were performed which led to different size distributions of the strengthening phase. Results from the microstructural characterization and hardness property assessments of these high-entropy alloys were compared to a commercial, high-strength Ni-based superalloy RR1000. Potentially, precipitation-strengthened high-entropy alloys could find applications replacing Ni-based superalloys as structural materials in power generation applications.

TI Double minimum creep in the rafting regime of a single-crystal Co-base

SO SCRIPTA MATERIALIA
AB To investigate whether the formation of rafts in Co-base superalloys has a hardening or softening effect, the single crystal deformation behavior was studied in the high temperature/low stress creep regime. The large positive lattice misfit of the investigated Co-base superalloy led to a pronounced directional coarsening of the microstructure normal to the stress axis during compressive creep at 950 degrees C/150 MPa. Two creep minima were observed similar to Ni-base superalloys under tensile creep. Rafting was accompanied by a decreasing creep rate indicating a hardening effect, although cutting of gamma' rafts by partial dislocations under the formation of stacking faults occurred.

AB MCrAlY type (M = Ni and/or Co) coatings are widely used for the protection of components in the hot sections of gas turbines at high service temperatures by forming a continuous alpha-alumina. A reliable criterion to estimate the capability of coating to form alpha-alumina is of great importance to accurately evaluate coating lifetime. However, some coatings retain the ability to form a continuous alpha-alumina scale when the concentration of Al in coatings decreases to a critical level, therefore, the empirical Al-concentration based criterion is inadequate to properly predict the formation of a continuous alpha-alumina. Thus, a new life criterion, namely the critical Al-activity criterion, is proposed.
   In this work, the critical Al-activity to form a continuous a-alumina was validated by Al-activity calculation using Thermo-Calc software based on survey of research results of critical Al-concentration to form alpha-alumina on binary Ni-Al and ternary Ni-Cr-Al systems. Long-term oxidation tests were performed to support the criterion: three different MCrAlY coatings coated on IN-792 superalloy substrates were oxidized at 1000 degrees C for various periods of time up to 10,000 h. The microstructural evolution of MCrAlY coatings was investigated using Scanning Electron Microscope. The near-surface Al concentration and interdiffusion behaviour between substrate and coating were measured using Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy. The new critical Al-activity criterion has been successfully adopted in alpha-alumina formation prediction, showing a good agreement with experiment results. Therefore, it can be concluded that the extrapolation of new criterion from binary and ternary systems to multi-alloyed MCrAlY system is reasonable. Furthermore, the partial pressure of oxygen (P-O2) in atmosphere has been taken into consideration by combination with Al-activity to calculate the critical chemical reaction constant (K) of formation of a-alumina. The potential applicability of the methodology to predict MCrAlY life is also discussed.

TI Microstructural homogenization and high-temperature cyclic oxidation
   behavior of a Ni-based super alloywith high-Cr content
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB A new Ni-based superalloy with high-Cr content was designed for industrial gas turbines application. The microstructural homogenization and high-temperature cyclic oxidation behavior was investigated systematically. The results showed that the optimum heat treatment condition was 1563 K (1290 degrees C)/4 h + 1573 K (1300 degrees C)/6 h, A. C. (air cooling) + 1393 K (1120 degrees C)/2 h, A. C. + 1143 K (870 degrees C)/24 h, A. C., which can completely dissolve the gamma/gamma' eutectic and the Ni-3(TiTa) phase in the interdendritic region. The cyclic oxidation results showed that a multilayer of continuous and dense oxide-rich regions formed and the kinetic curves followed a parabolic law. The mass gain at 1323 K (1050 degrees C) and 1343 K (1070 degrees C) was 4.02 mg/cm(2) and 4.23 mg/cm(2), respectively. No severe spallation of the oxide-rich region was observed. The outer layer of the oxide-rich region mainly consisted of Cr2O3, TiO2, and (Ni, Co) Cr2O4 spinels, while the layer at the substrate-oxide interface was found to be Al2O3. The results show that this new superalloy has a better cyclic oxidation resistance at 1343 K (1070 degrees C) than the commonly used IN738 and GTD-111 superalloys. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Using state-of-the-art atomic scale super energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and high angle annular dark field imaging this study reveals the elemental partitioning preference between the gamma' and gamma phases in a Co-Al-W-Ti-Ta superalloy and the site preference of its alloying elements in the ordered L1(2) gamma' phase. A semi-quantitative analysis of atomic column compositions in the ordered L1(2) gamma' structure is provided. Co atoms were found to occupy the {1/2, 1/2, 0} face-center positions whereas Al, W, Ti and Ta atoms prefer to occupy the {0, 0, 0} cube corner positions in the L1(2) gamma phase. These findings agree well with predictions from first principles simulations in the literature.

SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB The local compositional changes associated with stacking fault and microtwin formation during creep at intermediate temperatures in a commercial Ni-base disk superalloy are explored. In order to investigate microtwin formation, an [001] single crystal of ME3 was tested in compression at 760 degrees C under a stress of 414 MPa - a stress-temperature regime found to promote microtwinning. Atomic resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy combined with state-of-the-art energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy analysis reveals the presence of Co and Cr rich Cottrell atmospheres around leading dislocations responsible for the creation of SISFs, SESFs, and microtwins. This analysis also highlights the role that tertiary gamma particles inside gamma ' precipitates have on gamma ' shearing deformation mechanisms. Through the use of CALPHAD calculations, combined with new experimental observations, new insights into the rate controlling processes during creep deformation are discussed.

TI Martensitic transformation in a B2-containing CuZr-based BMG composite
   revealed by in situ neutron diffraction
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB CuZr-based bulk-metallic-glass (BMG) composites reinforced by a B2-type CuZr crystalline-phase (CP) have been widely studied, and exhibit that the plastic deformation of the CP induces martensitic transformation from the B2 to B190, which plays a dominant role in the deformation behavior and mechanical properties. In the present study, 2.0% Co containing CuZr-based BMG composites were investigated using in-situ neutron-diffraction technique. The in-situ neutron-diffraction results reveal the continuous load transfer from the glass matrix to B2 CP and martensitic transformation from the B2 CP to B190 during the deformation of the composite. Moreover, it was found that the martensitic transformation is initiated at the applied stress higher than 1500 MPa, and is significantly suppressed during the deformation, as compared to other 0.5% Co-containing CuZr-based BMG composites. Based on these in-situ neutron-diffraction results, the martensitic transformation is strongly affected by the amount of the addition of Co, which determines the mechanical properties of CP-reinforced BMG composites, such as ductility and hardening capability.

TI Effect of Directional Solidification Variables on the Microstructures of
   Single-Crystal Turbine Blades of Nickel-Based Superalloy
SO ADVANCED ENGINEERING MATERIALS
AB Single-crystal turbine blades of nickel-based superalloy are directionally solidified at different withdrawal rates of 0.0017 cm s(-1)-0.01 cm s(-1) aiming to investigate the evolution of as-cast microstructures. The results show that the average primary and secondary dendrite arm spacings,.1 and.2, decrease with increasing withdrawal rate, although the complicated geometry of the blades results in local nonhomogeneity of dendrite arm spacings. The experimentally achieved values of.1 can be reasonably predicted by Ma and Sahm's theoretical model, in which the effect of the secondary dendrite on the primary dendrite arm spacing is considered. With increasing withdrawal rate, the shape of the g/ g0 eutectic varies from a large block-like eutectic island to an interconnected small strip-like morphology. In addition to this, the average size of the g/ g0 eutectic gradually decreases with increasing withdrawal rate. A reduction in the average sizes of the g0 precipitates in the dendrite core and interdendritic region is also observed with increasing withdrawal rate. The microsegregation levels of Al, Ti, Ta, Cr, Co, and Mo are alleviated with increasing withdrawal rate.

TI Effect of Ru on the Oxidation Behavior of a Ni-Base Single-Crystal
   Superalloy
SO SCIENCE OF ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB The effect of Ru on the isothermal oxidation of Ni-base single crystal superalloys has been investigated by discontinuous thermogravimetric analysis. The scale structures were analyzed using XRD, SEM and EDX. The kinetic curves of the alloys exposed at 1000 degrees C and 1100 degrees C obeyed the parabolic law, and the addition of Ru had minimal direct effect on the oxide phase types. The scales for three alloys with various Ru additions were mainly composed of an outer (Ni, Co) O layer, a second complex oxides layer, and an inner Al2O3 layer. The spallation of the scale was observed after a long time oxidation at 1000 degrees C and 1100 degrees C. The mass gains of the alloys with Ru addition were higher than those of the alloys without Ru addition when exposed to high temperatures at 1000 degrees C and 1100 degrees C. This showed that the addition of Ru can reduce the oxidation resistance in the alloy oxidation at high temperatures due to Ru inhibiting the formation of Al2O3 layer. Furthermore, the rate of oxidation for the alloy with 3 Ru addition at 1100 degrees C was slower than that of the alloy with 1.5 Ru addition since the weak-bond in NiWO4 was limited by Ru addition. The internal nitride was obtained from the three alloys with Ru addition due to the loose Al2O3 films.

TI Synthesis and characterization of superalloy coatings by cathodic arc
   evaporation
SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB Superalloy targets were produced from Ni-(Al-C-Co-Cr-Mo-Ta-Ti-W) powders by spark plasma sintering technology. The crystalline structure of the as-produced targets was investigated by XRD analysis and compared with the evolution of phases resulting from the operation of the cathodic arc at the target (cathode) surface. Coatings were synthesized at superalloy substrates utilizing these superalloy targets in non-reactive and reactive evaporation processes. Synthesized coatings and target surfaces were compared with respect to chemical composition and crystal structure. The interface between coating and superalloy substrates was investigated by TEM. As an example, a complete layer stack was synthesized by cathodic arc evaporation starting from the super alloy substrate - superalloy coating interface to a fully oxidized superalloy coating showing epitaxial growth in the interface to the superalloy substrate.

TI Effects of strain amount and strain rate on grain structure of a novel
   high Co nickel-based polycrystalline superalloy
SO MATERIALS & DESIGN
AB The development of nickel-based superalloys with high Co addition has aroused widespread interest recently owing to their potential application in hot sections of gas turbine. However, how hot working parameters impact the grain evolution of these superalloys remains to be studied systematically. In this work, high-throughput double cone ( DC) specimen, which yielded gradient strain at different regions in a single sample after hot compression, were designed to investigate the thermo-mechanical behaviors of a novel superalloy. Superslovus treatment was subsequently conducted to investigate the susceptibility to abnormal grain growth (AGG). By means of finite element simulation, transmission electron microscope (TEM), and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), it was found that slow strained DC was preferred to obtain a well-distributed grain structure after supersolvus annealing, owing to its adequate dynamical recrystallization (DRX) and dynamical recovery (DRV) during deformation.

TI Effects of Precipitant and pH on Coprecipitation of Nanosized Co-Cr-V
   Alloy Powders
SO MATERIALS
AB Nanosized Co-Cr-V alloy powders were synthesized via coprecipitation method. Effects of precipitants ((NH4)(2)C2O4<bold>H</bold>2O and Na2CO3) and pH were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Zeta potential analyzer, thermogravimetry-differential scanning calorimetry (TG-DSC), inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Co-Cr-V alloy powders were consisted of major face-centered cubic Co (fcc Co) and minor hexagonal close-packed Co (hcp Co). Grain sizes of precursors and Co-Cr-V alloy powders were increased with pH value (7-10) within the ranges of 3 similar to 39 and 39 similar to 66 nm, respectively. Rod-like or granular Co-Cr-V alloy particles were assembled by interconnected nanograins. At pH = 7, Na2CO3 precipitant was found to be beneficial to maintain the desirable composition of Co-Cr-V powders. It was also found that lower pH favors the maintenance of pre-designed composition, while grain coarsens at higher pH. Effects of variation for precipitant and pH on the morphology and composition of Co-Cr-V alloy powder were discussed in detail and relevant mechanism was further proposed.

TI Heterogeneous precipitation behavior and stacking-fault-mediated
   deformation in a CoCrNi-based medium-entropy alloy
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB Combining high strength and good ductility is highly-desired yet challenging for conventional structural materials. Newly emerging concentrated multi-component alloys with face-centered-cubic structure provide an ultra-ductile matrix, and the precipitation hardening based on these alloys provides a very effective way to achieve a superior strength-ductility combination. Here, we report a high-strength CoCrNi-based medium-entropy alloy hardened by nanoscale L1(2)-(Ni, Co, Cr)(3)(Ti, AD-type particles with mixing heterogeneous and homogeneous precipitation behaviors. Compared to the single-phase CoCrNi medium-entropy alloy, the yield strength and the tensile strength of the precipitation strengthened CoCrNi medium-entropy alloy were increased by-70% to-750 MPa and-44% to -1.3 GPa, respectively, whereas a good ductility,-45%, was still achieved. The underlying deformation micro-mechanisms were systematically investigated using transmission electron microscope. In the single-phase CoCrNi medium-entropy alloy, the deformation mode was dominated by mechanical twinning. In the precipitation-hardened medium-entropy alloy, however, a high density of stacking faults prevailed. We revealed that the absence of mechanical twinning in this low stacking fault energy precipitation-strengthened medium-entropy alloy could relate to the increasing critical twinning stress affected by the channel width of the matrix. We further calculated that the increment of the yield strength was substantially from precipitation strengthening. Our present findings provide not only a fundamental understanding of the deformation micro-mechanism of the precipitation-strengthened CoCrNi medium-entropy alloy but also a useful guidance for the development of precipitation hardened concentrated multi-component alloys in the future.

TI Large-scale simulation of dendrite growth in directional solidification
   castings
SO PHYSICA STATUS SOLIDI B-BASIC SOLID STATE PHYSICS
AB In this study, the growth and distribution of directional solidification (DS) dendrites in entire cross-sections of DS superalloy castings are simulated based on a modified shape function dendritic (MSFD) model coupled with the cellular automaton-finite difference (CA-FD) method. The macro-thermal transfer and columnar grain growth are calculated using CA-FD with a macro time-step, and then, the original and boundary conditions for the dendrite-growth simulation are determined via the interpolation of the macro temperature and the projection of the 3D preferential grain orientation using a matrix, M. The dendrite growth calculation cyclically proceeds based on the MSFD model. It is used to predict the growth of hundreds of dendrites throughout the cross-section of a DS casting by considering the macro-solidification parameters. The MSFD model is further applied to predict the competitive growth of DS dendrites and their distribution in the cross-sections of a spiral selector and a fake single crystal turbine blade. The results of the simulation correlate with the results of the DS experiment. Hence, the modified model coupled with the macro-simulation models can be used to predict the morphology and distribution of DS dendrites with respect to large-scale castings produced by the DS process.

TI Effects of titanium substitutions for aluminum and tungsten in
   Co-10Ni-9Al-9W (at%) superalloys
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB Polycrystalline Co-10Ni-(9 - x)Al-(9 - x)W-2xTi at% (x = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4) alloys with gamma(f.c.c.) plus gamma'(L1(2)) microstructures are investigated, where the gamma'(L1(2))-formers Al and W are replaced with Ti. Upon aging, the initially cuboidal gamma'(L1(2))-precipitates grow and develop a rounded morphology. After 256 h of aging at 1000 degrees C, the precipitates in the 6 and 8 at% Ti alloys coalesce and develop an irregular, elongated morphology. After 1000 h of aging, replacement of W and Al with Ti increases both the mean radius, < R >, and volume fraction, phi, of the gamma'(L1(2))-phase from < R > = 463 nm and phi = 8% for 2 at% Ti to < R > = 722 nm and phi = 52% for 8 at% Ti. Composition measurements of the gamma(f.c.c.)-matrix and gamma'(L1(2))-precipitates demonstrate that Ti substitutes for W and Al in the gamma'(L1(2))-precipitates, increases the partitioning of W to gamma'(L1(2)), and changes the partitioning behavior of Al from a mild gamma'(L1(2))-former to a mild gamma(f.c.c.)-former. The grain boundaries in the aged alloys exhibit W-rich precipitates, most likely mu(Co7W6)-type, which do not destabilize the gamma(f.c.c.) plus gamma'(L1(2)) microstructure within the grains. Four important benefits accrue from replacing W and Al with Ti: (i) the alloys' mass density decrease; (ii) the gamma'(L1(2))-solvus temperature increases; (iii) the gamma'(L1(2)) volume fraction formed during aging at 1273 K (1000 degrees C) increases; and (iv) the 0.2% offset flow stress increases.

TI Phase Composition and Cracking Behavior on TIG Cladding Layer of

SO RARE METAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING
AB Co-Al-W superalloy is a novel cobalt-based superalloy with the precipitation strengthening phase of ternary compound gamma-Co-3(Al,W). In order to study the cracking behavior of Co-8.8A1-9.8W-0.2B cladding layer on 304 stainless steel with TIG welding, the phase composition and relative contents at different positions of the cladding layer were investigated by thermodynamic simulation calculation of JMatPro software and experimental verification. The results show that the phase composition is the same at different positions of the cladding layer, but the content of those phases are not alike. Combining phase composition and contents of the cladding layer, the surface cracks of cladding layer are mainly hot cracks, which come from the integrated effect of the thermal stress, the phase transformation stress and the Laves phase.

TI Effect of W Content on Oxidation Resistance of Experimental Third
   Generation Single Crystal Superalloys
SO RARE METAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING
AB The isothermal oxidation behaviors of three kinds of experimental third generation single crystal superalloys with different tungsten contents were investigated at 1100 degrees C in air by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning election microscopy (SEM) and energy disperse X-ray analysis (EDS). The results show that three kinds of alloys approximately obey subparabolic rate law during oxidation at 1100 degrees C for 100 h. The mass gain of 8 wt% W-containing alloy is higher than that of 6 wt% and 7 wt% W-containing alloys. The oxide scale exposed at 1100 degrees C consists of three layers: an outer Ni(Co)O layer, an intermediate layer mainly composed of oxides and spinels, and an inner Al2O3 layer. The gamma'-free layer is formed in the base alloy. In the current alloy system, the transition of oxidation mechanism happens with increasing W content at 1100 degrees C; therefore, it is found that the alloys with W content less than 7% exhibit relative balance between oxidation resistance and solution strength.

TI Effect of V on Hot Corrosion Behavior of K417G Alloy at 900 degrees C
SO RARE METAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING
AB The effect of V on hot corrosion behavior of cast Ni-base superalloy K417G exposed to 75%Na2SO4 +25%NaCl at 900 degrees C for 100 h has been investigated by thermogravimetry (TG) and scanning electron microscopy equipped with energy dispersive X-ray spectrum (EDS), and corrosion resistance was obtained by measuring the polarization curve at 900 degrees C. The results show that the hot corrosion rate of the alloy with 0.016% V content is almost unchanged, the hot corrosion rate of alloy increases with the increase of V content, but the hot corrosion rate of alloy with 1.19% V content is 100 times more than that of the low V alloy. The corrosion product on the surface of K417G alloys is found to be composed of oxides and sulfides. The oxides consist of Al, Cr, Co, Ti and Ni, while the sulfides include NiS, MoS and NiCrS. With the content of V content increasing, S element diffuses toward to interlayer, and the layer of Al2O3 and Cr2O3 becomes thinner; hence the inner sulfides layer formed in the alloy with 1.19% V decreases the corrosion resistance. Compared with the alloy with 1.19% V, the corrosion potential of the alloy with 0.016% V shifts 0.4 V toward positive direction, and the corrosion resistance is better than that alloy with high V content.

TI Influence of high-temperature annealing on morphological and
   compositional changes of phases in Ni-base single crystal superalloy
SO MATERIALS CHARACTERIZATION
AB Microstructure evolution during high temperature annealing of the CM186LC single crystal nickel-base super alloy in the temperature range of 900-1100 degrees C for up to 2500 h was investigated. Microstructural analyses were aimed at observing the changes in morphology of precipitates, in both two dimensions (2D) and three dimensions (3D). The changes in the chemical composition of constituting phases, caused by annealing, were also determined. Although no external stress was applied, after annealing at 1000 degrees C and 1100 degrees C the directional coalescence of the gamma' phase in directions parallel to secondary dendrite arms occurred. In the temperature range of 900-1100 degrees C, decomposition of the primary MC carbides took place. The primary carbides were fragmented into small plate-shaped particles, and secondary carbides were also formed. Additionally, in the investigated temperature range, the precipitates of topologically close packed (TCP) phases were found. Those precipitates, plate-like in shape, grew up to a length of several micrometres. Coalescence of the gamma' phase and formation of TCP precipitates during high temperature exposure of CM186LC was accompanied by decreases in the concentrations of Co, Cr, W and Re in the gamma phase.

TI Lattice parameter misfit evolution during creep of a cobalt-based
   superalloy single crystal with cuboidal and rafted gamma-prime
   microstructures
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB A [h00] oriented Co-based superalloy single crystal was crept under tension at 940 degrees C/100 MPa, resulting in a P-type raft morphology with extensive particle coalescence along the [h00] loading direction. However, particle coalescence was also observed in two perpendicular directions on the (h00) plane, normal to the loading axis. Tensile creep experiments were performed with in-situ neutron diffraction at 800 degrees C/500 MPa on this initially rafted gamma' microstructure, and for comparison at (i) 900 degrees C/260 MPa, and at (ii) 750 degrees C/875 MPa, both with initially cuboidal gamma' microstructures. The alloy was shown to exhibit a positive lattice parameter misfit, and during the first hour of creep at 900 degrees C/260 MPa, the lattice parameter evolution indicated changes in phase composition associated with gamma' dissolution as the alloy achieved phase equilibrium at 900 degrees C. For all three in-situ creep measurements, there was a significant divergence of the gamma' and gamma lattice parameters as creep proceeded. The lattice parameter misfit values between the precipitates and the matrix approached their unconstrained values during creep, and were notably large compared to those of Ni-based superalloys. This is indicative of a loss of coherency at the precipitate/matrix interfaces. Such a loss of coherency at the precipitate/matrix interfaces will likely degrade certain mechanical properties such as fatigue resistance, as has been shown for the Ni-based superalloys.

TI A novel type of Co-Ti-Cr-base gamma/gamma ' superalloys with low mass
   density
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB A gamma' strengthened Co-Ti-Cr superalloy is presented with a mass density similar to 14 % below that of typical Co-Al-W-based alloys. The lattice misfit is sufficiently low to form coherent cuboidal gamma' precipitates. Atom probe tomography shows that Cr partitions to the gamma phase, but increases the gamma' volume fraction compared to a binary Co-Ti alloy to more than 60 %. The solubility of Cr in the gamma' phase is significantly higher than expected from previously published values. The gamma' solvus temperature is above 1100 degrees C. The yield strength shows a distinct increase above 600 degrees C surpassing that of Co-9Al-8W (at.%) and conventional Co-base superalloys, even more so when it is normalized by the mass density.

TI Hot corrosion behavior of HVOF-sprayed Cr3C2-WC-NiCoCrMo coating
SO CERAMICS INTERNATIONAL
AB A novel binary carbide-based sprayed powder, consisting of hard phases (Cr3C2, WC) and matrix phase (NiCoCrMo), was designed to ensure the harsh environments (corrosion, wear, and high temperature) of power plant boilers. A Cr3C2-WC-NiCoCrMo coating was deposited by high-velocity oxygen-fuel (HVOF) process using an agglomerated and sintered Cr3C2-WC-NiCoCrMo powder with a particle size of -45+15 mu m. Hot-corrosion tests were performed under cyclic conditions using a NaCl-KCI-Na2SO4 salt environment, at temperatures up to 500 degrees C. High-temperature oxidation was performed at 500 degrees C. For comparison, corrosion and oxidation tests were also performed on a commercial Cr3C2-25(NiCr) coating, and the corrosion resistance was evaluated by measuring the thickness of the corrosion scale. The properties of the specimens were characterized using X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive spectroscopy. The Cr3C2-WC-NiCoCrMo and Cr3C2-25(NiCr) coatings exhibited similar oxidation-resistance properties. The Cr3C2-WC-NiCoCrMo coating exhibited superior corrosion resistance to that of the Cr3C2-25(NiCr) coating. In the case of the Cr3C2-WC-NiCoCrMo coating, the thickness of the corrosion scale was approximately one-third that of the Cr3C2-25(NiCr) coating. The hot-corrosion resistance imparted by the Cr3C2-WC-NiCoCrMo coating may be attributed to the formation of alloy phases during the powder and coating manufacturing process, as well as to the formation of Cr, W, Ni, Co and Mo oxides, and Ni and Cr spinels.

TI Tensile properties of Co-based oxide dispersion strengthened superalloys
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Tensile properties of a novel Co-20Cr-5Al-2.4Hf-1.5Y(2)O(3) (wt%) oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) superalloy were studied through a comparing investigation with Co-20Cr-5Al (wt%) alloy. Both the Co-based alloys (with and without oxide particles) were fabricated by mechanical alloying (MA), spark plasma sintering (SPS), hot rolling and the final annealing at 1200 degrees C. Due to the ultrafine grains of 500 nm in the ODS superalloy and 1.2 mu m in the ODS free alloy, the metastable fcc structure predominates at room temperature. Tensile testing was conducted at room temperature and 1000 degrees C. Strain-induced twinning deformation was evidenced by transmission electron microscopy and was found to significantly enhance the ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of the two alloys at room temperature. The Co-based ODS superalloy exhibits a superior tensile strength of 2.85 GPa at room temperature, which is associated with the distribution of twins and fine Y-Hf oxides. At 1000 degrees C, since the ultrafine grain size in the ODS superalloys, an easy grain boundary deformation occurred and resulted in a significant reduction in the UTS value. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI Transient Liquid Phase Bonding of Nickel-Base Single Crystal Alloy with

SO HIGH TEMPERATURE MATERIALS AND PROCESSES
AB A novel Ni-Cr-Co-W-Mo-Ta-Re-B alloy consisting of plate gamma and M23B6 phases was prepared as interlayer for the transient liquid phase (TLP) bonding of Rene' N5 nickel-base single crystal superalloy. The molten Ni-Cr-Co-W-Mo-Ta-Re-B alloy exhibited an excellent wettability on the nickel-base superalloy. The TLP bonding experiment has been carried out in vacuum furnace at 1,240 degrees C for 12 h and followed by post-weld heat treatment (PWHT) at 1,305 degrees C for 4 h. PWHT eliminated the inter-metallic compounds and promoted the formation of. gamma ' precipitates in the bonding region. A more uniform microhardness profile of TLP joint was found after PWHT. The shear strength of the joint after PWHT significantly increased to 533.4 MPa compared with the value of 437.2 MPa without PWHT.

TI A continuum approach to combined gamma/gamma ' evolution and dislocation
   plasticity in Nickel-based superalloys
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLASTICITY
AB In single crystal Nickel-based superalloys subject to creep loading, the gamma/gamma' phase microstructure co-evolves with the system of dislocations under load. Computational modeling thus requires multiphysics approaches capable of describing and simulating both phase and defect microstructures within a common conceptual framework. To do so, we formulate a coupled continuum model of the evolution of phase and dislocation microstructures. The simulated gamma/gamma' phase microstructure accounts for concentration as well as crystallographic order parameters. Dislocation microstructure evolution is described in terms of dislocation densities and associated stress-driven dislocation fluxes. The creep strain curve is obtained as a natural by-product of the microstructure evolution equations. We perform simulations of gamma/gamma' evolution for different dislocation densities and establish the driving forces for microstructure evolution by analyzing in detail the changes in different contributions to the elastic energy and chemical free energy density, as well as the evolution of stress concentrations that may trigger the transition from dislocation flow in the gamma channels towards shearing of the gamma' precipitates. Our investigation reveals the mechanisms controlling the process of directional coarsening (rafting) and demonstrates that the kinetics of rafting significantly depends on characteristics of the dislocation microstructure. In addition to rafting under constant load, we investigate the effect of changes in loading conditions and explore the possibility of improving creep properties by pre-rafting along a different loading path.

TI Microstructural evolution and mechanical properties of TLP bonded joints
   of Mar-M247 superalloys with Ni-Cr-Co-W-Ta-B interlayer
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY
AB The three-stage isothermal solidification process of TLP bonded Mar-M247 nickel-based superalloy was studied. The transient liquid phase bonding of Mar-M247 superalloys was conducted at 1150 degrees C for 1,60, 120 and 240 min. Dendritic formation and solute partitioning governed the microstructure development. Ni-rich solid solution, Ni-rich boride W-rich boride and other carboborides were formed in the joint area. The maximum tensile strength of 443 MPa was obtained when TLP bonding at 1150 degrees C for 240 min. It had completed isothermal solidification. After isothermal solidification, the distribution of microhardness across the joints was more homogeneous. Enrichment of refractory elements in the Ni-Cr-Co-W-Ta-B interlayer was detrimental to the process of isothermal solidification. The presence of hard and brittle borides reduced the hardness and tensile strength of the bonded area. Post-bonding heat treatments are suggested to improve mechanical properties in future studies.

   Co-10Ni-6Al-(0,2,4,6) W-6Ti (at%) cobalt-based superalloys
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB The effects of reducing the W concentration (and concomitantly mass density) of Co-10Ni-6A1-xW-6Ti at% Co-based superalloys, with a gamma(f.c.c.) plus gamma'(L1(2)) microstructure, is investigated for a series of alloys with W concentrations of 6 at% (baseline alloy), 4 and 2 at% (W-reduced) and 0 at% (W-free). The gamma'(L1(2)) solvus temperature decreases strongly (by 46 degrees C per 1 at% reduction in W), while the liquidus and solvus temperatures decrease mildly (3-5 degrees C per 1 at% W reduction) as measured by differential scanning calorimetry. Scanning electron microscopy was used to image phase formation in all alloys. When aging at 900 or 1000 degrees C for 256 h, the W reduction does not result in the appearance of additional phases within the grains beyond the gamma(f.c.c.) and gamma'(L1(2)) phases present in the original alloy. Grain-boundary precipitates are present for all alloy compositions: W-rich or W-free precipitates after aging at 1000 degrees C, and coarsened gamma'(L1(2)) precipitates after aging at 900 degrees C. The composition of grain boundary precipitates were measured with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Vickers microhardness values decrease with decreasing W content, due to a reduction in gamma'(L1(2)) precipitation and 'reduced solid-solution strengthening.

TI Formation of nanograins in Ni-Co based superalloys compressed
   quasistatically at high temperature
SO SCRIPTA MATERIALIA
AB In this study, the performance of hot compressive deformation was investigated in two newly developed Ni-Co based superalloys having different stacking fault energy (SFE). It is interesting to discover that nanograins (NGs) can be produced in superalloy deformed at high temperature and relatively low strain rate. With the decrease of SFE and strain rate, the formation of NGs will be promoted obviously, leading to the negative strain rate sensitivity of compressive stress in superalloys. The NGs, generated through the fragmentation of subgrains by microtwins, may become a candidate choice for dynamically strengthening superalloys at high temperature. (C) 2017 Acta Materialia Inc.

TI Effects Effects of Ni/Co ratio and mechanical alloying on
   characteristics and sintering behavior of W-Ni-Co tungsten heavy alloys
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB W-Ni-Co tungsten heavy alloys with a varied Ni/Co ratio produced by mechanical alloying have been investigated in this study. The change of the Ni/Co ratio and the processing of mechanical alloying are important to influence characteristics and sintering behavior of the model materials. The results show that the high Ni/Co ratio facilitates the process of solid phase sintering and promotes a fine-grained structure and a relatively high hardness. However, the behavior of liquid phase sintering was found in the alloys with the low Ni/Co ratio condition, corresponding to a coarse-grained structure and decrease in hardness. The mechanisms of the transition between the solid and liquid states during sintering has been discussed in this work, which can be associated with the amount of binder phase and its composition, tungsten grain size, deformation strain and sintering conditions.

SO MATERIALS AND CORROSION-WERKSTOFFE UND KORROSION
AB In the present study, a thin intermediate protective -alumina layer was pre-deposited by slurry dip-coating technique on APS-CoNiCrAlY bond coat prior depositing APS-YSZ as top coat. The alumina layer acts as barrier for oxygen diffusion to protect the metallic bond coat from excessive oxidation. The new TBC was compared with the standard TBC system which comprises of Ni-superalloy substrate, CoNiCrAlY bond coat and YSZ top coat concerning the behavior under thermal cycling at 1150 degrees C. The samples were investigated before and after thermal cycling by optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) equipped with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD). Image analysis was used to compare between the microstructure by measuring the crack lengths and the thermally grown oxide layer (TGO) average thickness after thermal cycling. It was observed that a more uniform and compact -Al2O3 TGO was formed in the new TBC system after thermal cycling comparing to the commercial one. It was, also, found that the alumina intermediate layer has the potential to reduce the length of the cracks and the average thickness of TGO by suppressing the detrimental mixed oxides, like Cr2O3, CoO, NiO, and (Ni, Co)(Cr, Al)(2)O-4, thus, improving the TBC durability.

TI Plastic deformation behavior of spray formed superalloy FGH100
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES

AB Hot compression tests of hot isostatic pressed (HIPped) spray formed (SF) nickel-base superalloy were carried out in the temperature range of 1050-1150 degrees C at strain rates of 0.001-1 s (1), between 10-70% of engineering strain, using a Gleeble-1500 thermal simulator. Thereafter, the flow curve was developed and the constitutive equation of flow stress during hot deformation was established. The results show that the flow stress decreases by increasing deformation temperature and decreasing strain rate. Processing maps were developed based on the data obtained using the principles of dynamic materials modeling. The microstructure of deformed samples was characterized using optical and electron microscopy. The processing maps exhibit the stability domain at the temperatures of 1140-1150 degrees C and strain rate of 0.01 s(-1), with a peak efficiency of approximately 50%. High deformation temperature and high strain rate are conducive to the occurrence of dynamic recrystallization. The activation energy of the new Ni-Cr-Co based SF superalloy FGH100 was found to be 866.7 kJ/mol. Besides, the experimental results verify the hyperbolic sine model including strain variable, reflecting the changing law of flow stress during the hot deformation process.

TI Preparation and Structure of Al plus Si Codeposited Coatings on.
   Ni-based Superalloys
SO RARE METAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING
AB The Al+Si codeposited coatings were prepared on DZ417G superalloy substrates by aluminization and siliconization using pack cementation. XRD, SEM and EDS were used to study the microstructure and morphology of coatings. The results show that during the co-deposition process, the structure formed on the coating surface changes with the change of Al and Si contents. In addition, the post heat-treatment also has an effect on the structure of coatings. When the composition (in wt%) of the packs is XAl-4NH(4)Cl-4Si-(92-X)Al2O3 (X= I, 4 and 6), the corresponding structures of the coatings are NiSi and Ni2Al3 after pack cementation, respectively. When Si content increases to 6 wt% and 10 wt%, the structure of the coatings is also NiSi or Ni2Al3. After post heat-treatment, because of Ni, Cr and Mo diffusion from the substrate, NiSi transforms to AlNi6Si3 or S-Ni2Si, while Ni2Al3 transforms to beta-NiAl. The Si level in the beta-NiAl coatings is very small. Cr or Mo dissolves into AlNi6Si3, delta-Ni2Si and beta-NiAl. Al content plays a role in the formations of coatings. When Al content is low in the pack, the structure of coatings is NiSi after Al + Si codeposition. However, when the Al content is above 4 wt%, the structures of coatings are Ni2Al3 after pack cementation. Cr-rich AlNi6Si3, Cr- and Mo-rich delta-Ni2Si as well as beta-NiAl coatings are formed after Al + Si codeposition followed by post heat-treatment.

The appropriate amounts' addition of rare earth elements leads to improved oxidation properties at 900 degrees C, especially La elements show the best oxidation resistance (129.008 mg/cm(2)). However, the base Co-9Al-10W alloy shows the worst oxidation performance (151.544 mg/cm(2)). Multilayer oxide layers formed during the oxidation process, the outer were mainly CoO and Co3O4 oxides, and the middle layer contained complex oxides (containing Co, Al, and W). The inner layer consists of little discontinuous oxides, included few Al2O3 oxides. There existed a different crack width and the base alloy had the widest crack. Moreover, there exists a phase transformation (gamma/gamma' to gamma/Co3W) at the interface between oxide film and substrate.

SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING AND PERFORMANCE
AB Superinvar Fe-31Ni-5Co alloy (SI) and Co-20Cr-15W-10Ni superalloy (SA) are used in space applications. Similar metal (SI-SI and SA-SA) joints as well as dissimilar metal (SA-SI) joints of these alloys have been made using electron beam welding (EBW) technique. Extensive characterization of these weldments has been carried out using optical and electron microscopy, microhardness measurements and tensile testing at ambient and cryogenic temperatures. It has been observed that weld efficiency is 100% for similar metal joints, whereas it is governed by base metal properties of the alloy having lower strength for dissimilar metal joint. Weld efficiency of SA-SI/EBW joint is comparable with base metal of lower strength indicating no detrimental formation of intermetallic/brittle phase. Microhardness of the SA-SI/EBW joint is found to be representative of the respective base metal properties with no sudden variation across the SA/SI interface in the weldment indicating good dilution in the weld. This has been confirmed through energy-dispersive spectrum using x-rays (EDX) showing the presence of Fe near the superalloy weldment interface and the presence of Cr and W near the superinvar weldment interface. Increase in strength and decrease in ductility of base metals are observed for all types of joints when tested at cryogenic temperature (77 K) vis-A -vis at ambient temperature. Fracture features of the failed surface of SA-SI/EBW joint are found to be similar to that of the SI-SI/EBW joint. Microhardness, mechanical properties and fracture analysis confirm that failure of dissimilar metal joint takes place toward lower strength base metal, i.e., superinvar.

Lattice parameter misfit values and the difference in phase stiffnesses at room temperature, 650 degrees C, and 900 degrees C are presented. These microstructural parameters should assist in refining computer models that aim to predict precipitate evolution in superalloys and aid future alloy design.

TI Microstructure and sliding wear properties of HVOF sprayed, laser
   remelted and laser clad Stellite 6 coatings

CY DEC 09-11, 2015
CL Limoges, FRANCE
AB The microstructure and sliding wear, properties of Co-Cr-W alloy (Stellite 6) coatings were studied in the dependence on the deposition technology. The HVOF as-sprayed, laser remelted HVOF sprayed and laser clad coatings were evaluated by SEM, XRD and ASTM G-133 reciprocating sliding wear test. In dependence on used deposition technology, the microstructure of coating varied namely in terms of grain size and phase composition. The XRD analyses in the wear track revealed that the strain-induced fcc-to-hcp transformation is taking part during wear of laser remelted HVOF sprayed coatings. The difference of the phase composition, grain size and strain-induced fcc-to-hcp transformation was shown to be responsible for differences in the sliding wear behaviour. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TI On the crystallography and composition of topologically close-packed
   phases in ATI 718Plus (R)
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB ATI 718Pluse (R) is a nickel-based superalloy developed to replace Inconel 718 in aero engines for static and rotating applications. Here, the long-term stability of the alloy was studied and it was found that topologically close-packed (TCP) phases can form at the gamma-eta interface or, less frequently, at grain boundaries. Conventional and scanning transmission electron microscopy techniques were applied to elucidate the crystal structure and composition of these TCP precipitates. The precipitates were found to be tetragonal sigma phase and hexagonal C14 Laves phase, both being enriched in Cr, Co, Fe and Mo though sigma has a higher Cr and lower Nb content. The precipitates were observed to be heavily faulted along multiple planes. In addition, the disorientations between the TCP phases and neighbouring eta/gamma were determined using scanning precession electron diffraction and evaluated in axis-angle space. This work therefore provides a series of compositional and crystallographic insights that may be used to guide future alloy design. (C) 2017 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Synergistic effect of reactive element co-doping in two-phase (gamma'
   plus beta) Ni-Al alloys
SO CORROSION SCIENCE
AB To propose reactive element (RE) co-doping strategy, the oxidation behaviour of Dy, Hf, Y, Zr single- and co-doped Ni-30AI alloys was comparatively studied. All the alloys containing Dy or Y exhibited improved scale adhesion due to the pinning effect of the pegs at the scale/alloy interfaces and the reduced residual stress by the flaky oxides formed on the alloy surfaces. Compared to the corresponding RE single-doping, Dy/Hf, Dy/Zr, Hf/Y and Y/Zr co-doping further reduced the scale growth rate, revealing a synergistic effect. The role of reactive element co-segregation in the formation of synergistic effect was analyzed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Long-term oxidation behavior and mechanism of DD6 Ni-based single
   crystal superalloy at 1050 degrees C and 1100 degrees C in air
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB By virtue of XRD, OM, SEM and EDS, detailed oxidation behaviors for 2000h exposure of DD6 Ni-based single crystal superalloy ware investigated at 1050 degrees C and 1100 degrees C. The oxidation kinetic curves both follow the parabolic law in the first stage, during which time the oxidation behaviors in interdendritic area and dendrite core area are different. With the oxidation time continuing, the morphologies of the oxides in these two kinds of areas gradually tend to coincide: An outer columnar (Ni, Co)O, an intermediate layer mainly composed of NiTa2O6, CoCo2O4, CoWO4, NiCr2O4 and other complex compounds and spinel phases, an inner continuous layer of alpha-Al2O3. The double diffusion of oxygen anions and Ni and Co cations developed inwards and outwards respectively is responsible for the morphology of the oxide scale. At 1100 degrees C, the Al2O3 film formed in the initial time is unstable, discontinuous and incompact and the inner Al2O3 layer formed after 300 h oxidation is porous. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI An analytical approach to the beta-phase coarsening behaviour in a
   thermally sprayed CoNiCrAlY bond coat alloy
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB This paper investigates the beta-phase coarsening behaviour during isothermal heat treatment of freestanding CoNiCrAlY (Co-31.7%Ni-20.8%Cr-8.1%Al-0.5%Y, all in wt%) coatings prepared by high velocity oxy-fuel (HVOF) thermal spraying. The microstructure of the coatings was characterised using scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD). It comprises a two phase structure of fcc gamma-Ni matrix and bcc beta-NiAl precipitates. The volume fraction of the gamma-Ni and the beta-NiAl phases were measured to be around 70% and 30% respectively, with grain sizes varying largely from 0.5 to 2 mu m for both phases. Isothermal heat treatments of the freestanding coatings were carried out at 1100 degrees C for times up to 250 h. The beta-phase coarsening behaviour during isothermal heat treatments was analysed by quantitative metallography. It is shown that the coarsening behaviour of beta phase in the CoNiCrAlY alloy followed the classical Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner (LSW) theory of Ostwald ripening. By incorporating a dimensionless factor Which correlates with volume fraction of the beta phase, a modified LSW model coupled with formulaic interfacial energy and effective diffusion coefficient of the CoNiCrAlY alloy was utilised to interpret the coarsening behaviour of the beta phase. The coarsening rate coefficient obtained from the modified LSW model shows good agreement with the corresponding experimental result. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Characterization of tool wear when machining alloy 718 with
   high-pressure cooling using conventional and surface-modified WC-Co
   tools
SO JOURNAL OF SUPERHARD MATERIALS
AB Coolant supplied by high pressure into the cutting zone has shown the lower thermal loads on the tool when machining difficult-to-cut materials as the Alloy 718. In this study, we investigate how the combination of high-pressure cooling and tool-surface modifications can lead to further improvements regarding tool life. The general approach is to enhance the coolant-tool interaction by increasing the contact area. Therefore, we machined cooling features into flank and rake faces of commercially available cemented tungsten carbide inserts. In this way, the surface area was increased by similar to 12%. After the cutting tests, the tools were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy combined with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Compared with conventional tools, the tool modifications reduced the flank wear by 45% for the investigated cutting parameters. Furthermore, we were able to significantly increase the cutting speed and feed rate without failure of the tool. The investigated surface modifications have great potential to enhance the productivity of metal cutting processes.

TI Investigation on Conductive Layer, Delamination, and Recast Layer
   Characteristics of Electro-discharge Machined Holes in TBCs
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING AND PERFORMANCE
AB In this study, electrical discharge machining (EDM) is used to directly drill normal effusion cooling holes in thermal-barrier-coated nickel-based superalloys (TBCs) via the assisting electrode method. The formation of the conductive layer was studied using scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive spectroscopy. The effects of the EDM process parameters including peak current, pulse duration, and duty cycle on delamination and recast layer characteristics were investigated. The analysis results indicate that the conductive layer possesses a feature of bilayer structure for the EDM of TBCs. The bottom layer is generated first due to the deposition of carbon-based products and molten brass debris, and its composition primarily contains C, Cu, Zr, and Zn; the surface layer is the result of the overlying of subsequently molten superalloy debris and carbon-based products, and its composition primarily consists of Ni, C, Cr, Nb, Co, Al, Fe, Cu, and Zr. The microcracks of the superalloy substrate only reside in the recast layer during the EDM of TBCs. The thickness of recast layer sharply increases with increasing peak current, pulse duration, and duty cycle, respectively. The delamination occurs at the ceramic coating/bond coating interface for the EDM of drilling normal holes in TBCs, and it can be eliminated by the selection of low discharge energy and appropriate duty cycle. Additionally, the length of delamination increases with increasing peak current, pulse duration, and duty cycle, respectively. The spalling of ceramic coating appears at the entrance of the hole due to the thermal-shock brittle fracture if excessive peak current, pulse duration, or duty cycle is selected.

TI Application of Computational Thermodynamics to the Design of a
   Co-Ni-Based gamma'-Strengthened Superalloy
SO METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND
   MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB A currently available commercial Calphad thermodynamic database was utilized to investigate its applicability to alloy design in the new class of Co-Ni-based gamma'-strengthened high-temperature alloys. A simple primary design criterion was chosen: maximize the gamma' solvus temperature in the six-component Co-Ni-Al-Ti-W-Ta system while ensuring no formation of secondary, potentially deleterious phases. Secondary design considerations included the effects of alloying elements on equilibrium gamma' volume fraction and on solidus and liquidus temperatures. The identified composition, Co-30Ni-9Al-3Ti-7W-2Ta-0.1B (expressed in mole percent), representing a conservative estimate of the maximum allowable concentrations of alloying additions Al, Ti, W, and Ta, was subsequently produced and characterized. The experimentally measured gamma' solvus temperature of the new alloy was 1491 +/- 3 K (1218 +/- 3 A degrees C), about 35 K (35 A degrees C) above any previously reported two-phase gamma-gamma' Co-(Ni)-based alloy. No secondary phases were observed in the alloy after annealing at temperatures between 1173 K and 1473 K (900 A degrees C and 1200 A degrees C). Additional alloy compositions with experimentally measured gamma' solvus temperatures in excess of 1533 K (1260 A degrees C) were also identified employing the same basic approach. The efficacy of currently available thermodynamic databases in their application to Co-based gamma'-strengthened superalloy development is discussed, including expanding design efforts to include additional alloying elements, as well as specific areas for improvement of future databases.

TI Fretting wear of pure cobalt chromium and nickel to identify the
   distinct roles of HS25 alloying elements in high temperature glaze layer
   formation
SO WEAR
AB HS25 cobalt-based superalloy was investigated between 100 and 600 degrees C under fretting wear (small amplitude reciprocating displacements) in a cross-cylinder contact. Tribological behavior was compared to pure cobalt, chromium and nickel tested under the same conditions and analyzed in terms of friction, wear, interface morphology and chemical composition by SEM-EDX and Raman spectroscopy. On HS25, the tribological tests resulted in the formation of a "glaze layer" of ground and compacted wear debris, which was protective against severe wear and high friction above 250 degrees C. Similar glaze layers were found for cobalt-cobalt (Co//Co) contacts, suggesting the determining role of cobalt in glaze layer formation whereas worn Cr//Cr and Ni//Ni interfaces exhibited poorly sintered debris and respectively adhesive and abrasive wear. To identify the role of alloying elements in glaze layer formation, the oxides formed in the interface were studied in terms of composition and thermal stability. As sintering appears to be a determining factor in glaze layer formation, the diffusion properties of cobalt and its oxides are emphasized. The strengthening and corrosion resistance properties of chromium and nickel in the alloy are also discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Effect of Ru on the Solidification Microstructure of a Ni-Based Single
   Crystal Superalloy with High Cr Content
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB Ni-based single crystal superalloys have been widely used in manufacturing the critical components of aero-engines, such as turbine blades and vanes. Improvements in phase stability on the addition of Ru are well known in the field of Ni-based superalloy development. Cr is beneficial to hot corrosion resistance of Ni-based superalloys. Generally, superalloys which used under easy corrosion conditions should contain high levels of Cr. Early researches about the influence of Ru on solidification microstructures in Ni-based single crystal alloys are mostly focused on low-Cr systerms (<6%). Since Cr has complex interactions with Ru, it is meanful to study the effects of Ru on solidification microstructures in high-Cr (>10%) Ni-based single crystal superalloy systems. The materials used in this work are Ni-based single crystal superalloy with high Cr content. Three superalloys by changing Ru addition (0, 1.5%, 3%, mass fraction) were designed. By observing the as-cast structure, the effect of Ru on the elements distribution and the precipitation characters of different phases in these alloys were studied. It is found that as the Ru content increases, the primary and secondary dendrite arm spacings decrease gradually; the volume fraction of (gamma+gamma') eutectic increases firstly and then decreases; the gamma' size is reduced progressively. The addition of 3% Ru leads to the formation of beta-NiAl phase, which contain a certain amount of Cr, Co and Ru except the basic elements Ni and Al. The typical "reverse partitioning" of other alloying elements is exhibited with the addition of Ru, while the formation of b-NiAl phase can reduce the "reverse partitioning" of other alloying elements. The addition of Ru could enhance the segregation of positive segregation elements Ta, Al and negative segregation element Re while reduce the segregation of positive segregation elements Mo and Cr.

TI Grain Boundary Engineering of a Low Stacking Fault Energy Ni-based
   Superalloy
SO METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND
   MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB The effects of thermo-mechanical processing parameters on the resulting microstructure of an experimental Nickel-based superalloy containing 24 wt pct Co were investigated. Hot compression tests were performed at temperatures ranging from 1293 K to 1373 K (1020 to 1100 A degrees C) and strain rates ranging from 0.0005 to 0.1/s. The mechanically deformed samples were also subject to annealing treatments at sub-solvus 1388 K (1115 A degrees C) and super-solvus 1413 K (1140 A degrees C) temperatures. This investigation sought to quantify and subsequently understand the behavior and evolution of both the grain boundary structure and length fraction of I 3 pound twin boundaries in the low stacking fault energy superalloy. Over the range of deformation parameters investigated, the corresponding deformation mechanism map revealed that dynamic recrystallization or dynamic recovery was dominant. These conditions largely promoted post-deformation grain refinement and the formation of annealing twins following annealing. Samples deformed at strain rates of 0.0005 and 0.001/s at 1333 K and 1373 K (1060 A degrees C and 1100 A degrees C) exhibited extensive grain boundary sliding/rotation associated with superplastic flow. Upon annealing, deformation conditions that resulted predominately in superplastic flow were found to provide negligible enhancement of twin boundaries and produced little to no post-deformation grain refinement.

AB The high-temperature oxidation of Co-based oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) Co-20Cr-(5, 10) Al-2.4Hf-1.5Y(2)O(3) (wt%) superalloys was investigated at 900 C-omicron and 1000 C-omicron. The 10Al (wt%) superalloys possess better oxidation resistance with the formation of alumina scale than the 5Al (wt%) with a duplex scale of CoCr2O4/Cr2O3 and internal Al2O3. The alumina on the 10Al superalloy is composed of theta- and alpha-alumina at 900 C-omicron but dominated by alpha-alumina at 1000 C-omicron. The lower weight gain of 10Al superalloys at 1000 C-omicron than at 900 C-omicron was associated with different growth mechanisms of the Al2O3 scales. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   heat treated states
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB The effects of magnesium addition on the microstructure, hardness, chemical composition and thermal expansion coefficient of NiAlCr alloys in as-cast and heat-treated states were studied. NiAlCr alloys containing 1, 2.5 and 3.8 at.% Mg were prepared via atmosphere-controlled induction melting following vacuum arc melting. According to the XRD results, as-cast alloys were mainly composed of martensite, beta-NiAl and gamma'-Ni3Al. High amounts of Mg in alloys resulted in a slight increase in CTE. Increasing Mg also changed the morphology of the interdendritic Ni3Al phase from continuous network to discontinuous structure, resulting in Ni2Mg precipitates with hardness of 1280 HV0.002. In the furnace cooling procedure following the annealing procedure at 1050 degrees C for 96 h, martensite completely transformed into beta-NiAl with alpha-Cr precipitates. The single phase Ni3Al transformed into Al0.9Ni4.22-Ni3Al lamellar structure and Ni2Mg phase disappeared. The presence of Mg in solid solution did not influence CTE of the alloys.

TI A unified material model for multiaxial ductile fracture and extremely
   low cycle fatigue of Inconel 718
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FATIGUE
AB This paper summarizes an extensive work of experimental and numerical studies of extremely low cycle fatigue (ELCF) on IN718 under room temperature. The ELCF is focused on low numbers of cyclic loading (fewer than 100 cycles) of fatigue failure. The IN718 cyclic plasticity behavior and the Bauschinger effect are studied and simulated using the well-known nonlinear kinematic hardening law by J.L. Chaboche and his co-workers under different strain amplitudes and different stress states. Moreover, the Voce isotropic hardening law was used in combination with the Bai-Wierzbicki plasticity model. The Bai-Wierzbicki plasticity model was used to capture the effect of different stress states on ELCF based on the stress triaxiality and Lode angle parameters. On the other hand, the modified Mohr-Coulomb (MMC) ductile fracture model for monotonic loading was extended by a new damage evolution rule to cover the ELCF regime. A new parameter was introduced to represent the effect of the cyclic loading at ELCF. The new parameter is responsible to capture the change of non-proportional loading direction between the current stress and the backstress tensors. A comparison between the experimental data and the finite element simulation results (by Abaqus/Explicit) shows excellent correlations. Lastly, a fractographic examinations and fracture modes simulations are presented. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI An Atom Probe Tomography study of site preference and partitioning in a
   nickel-based superalloy
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB Atom Probe Tomography (APT) has been utilised for an in-depth examination of the commercial polycrystalline Ni-based superalloy RR1000, assessing compositions of the primary, secondary and tertiary gamma' phases. Clear differences in the phase chemistries are noted, particularly for the tertiary gamma' to which much of the alloy strength is attributed. Trace amounts of Hf are found to segregate strongly to the primary and secondary gamma' phases, but also exhibit an extended diffusion profile across the gamma-gamma' interface up to 80 nm wide. Ti, Al and Mo demonstrate similar, yet not as pronounced diffusion profiles, indicating assumed phase chemistries may not be representative of those regions adjacent to the gamma-gamma' interface. Within gamma', unique element site-occupancy preferences for this alloy were identified. Finally, the grain boundary chemistry across a gamma-gamma interface and that of an intragranular boride were analysed, identifying the latter as a mixed M5B3 boride rich in Mo and Cr. These demonstrate further the depth of information on Ni-alloys accessible by APT, while the overall implications of results in comparison with other in-service/model alloys are also discussed.

TI Kinetics and Microstructural Investigation of High-Temperature Oxidation
   of IN-738LC Super Alloy
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING AND PERFORMANCE
AB The present study was carried out to investigate the kinetics and the surface chemistry of the oxide layers formed on the IN-738LC super alloy during high-temperature oxidation at 950 A degrees C in air from 1 to 260 h. Oxidation kinetics were studied by mass gain measurement. The oxide layers were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscope, elemental distribution map, energy-dispersive spectroscopy as well as x-ray diffractometry (XRD). The oxidation kinetics followed the parabolic law. The XRD analysis revealed that the oxide scale contained mainly NiO, Ni (Cr, Al)(2)O-4, Al2O3, TiO2 and Cr2O3. The oxide structure, from the top surface down to the substrate, was clarified by elemental map distribution studies as Ni-Ti oxides, Cr-Ti oxides, Cr2O3 oxide band, Ni-Co-Cr-W oxide and finally a blocky Al2O3 region. The oxidation scales were composed of three distinct layers of the outer and mid layers enriched by TiO2 and Cr2O3, NiCr2O4 oxide, respectively, and the innermost layer was composed of Al2O3 and matrix alloy. The depleted gamma prime layer was formed under the oxidation scales due to the impoverishment of Al and Ti which were induced by the formation of Al2O3 and TiO2.

TI Effect of alloy composition on the oxidation-induced boron depletion in
   cast Ni-base superalloy components
SO MATERIALS AND CORROSION-WERKSTOFFE UND KORROSION
AB The high temperature air oxidation of the two conventionally cast Ni-based superalloys Rene 80 containing 92wtppm boron and CM 247 containing 110wtppm of boron was studied at temperatures between 850 and 1050 degrees C and times ranging from 1 to 100h. Analysis by GD-OES and SEM/WDX/EBSD revealed the surface scale on Rene 80 after exposure at 1050 degrees C to consist of Cr2O3 with TiO2 in the outer part and BCrO3 and CrTi2O5 in the inner part. Internal Al2O3 precipitates were present below the external scale. After 1h exposure of CM 247 an inner dense alumina scale formed over eutectic alloy regions containing coarse precipitates. Over dendritic regions a Cr-rich oxide scale with BCrO3-precipitates formed initially and aluminum was internally oxidized. After longer oxidation times an alumina sub-scale grew from the internal precipitates, and oxidation of the initially present depleted alloy zones resulted in formation of outer Ni and Co rich oxides. In both alloys, boron depletion in the bulk alloy occurred due to formation of the mentioned boron rich oxide. The extent of depletion was substantially higher for the chromia forming Rene 80 than for CM 247. In the latter material the boron depletion was suppressed after the formation of the dense, inner alumina scale.

TI Nano-scale characterization of white layer in broached Inconel 718
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB The formation mechanism of white layers during broaching and their mechanical properties are not well investigated and understood to date. In the present study, multiple advanced characterization techniques with nano-scale resolution, including transmission electron microscopy (TEM), transmission Kikuchi diffraction (TKD), atom probe tomography (APT) as well as nano-indentation, have been used to systematically examine the microstructural evolution and corresponding mechanical properties of a surface white layer formed when broaching the nickel-based superalloy Inconel 718.
   TEM observations showed that the broached white layer consists of nano-sized grains, mostly in the range of 20-50 nm. The crystallographic texture detected by TKD further revealed that the refined microstructure is primarily caused by strong shear deformation. Co-located Al-rich and Nb-rich fine clusters have been identified by APT, which are most likely to be gamma' and gamma '' clusters in a form of co-precipitates, where the clusters showed elongated and aligned appearance associated with the severe shearing history. The microstructural characteristics and crystallography of the broached white layer suggest that it was essentially formed by adiabatic shear localization in which the dominant metallurgical process is rotational dynamic recrystallization based on mechanically-driven subgrain rotations. The grain refinement within the white layer led to an increase of the surface nano-hardness by 14% and a reduction in elastic modulus by nearly 10% compared to that of the bulk material. This is primarily due to the greatly increased volume fraction of grain boundaries, when the grain size was reduced down to the nanoscale.

Composition profiles across the microtwins and microtwin-parent boundaries are presented.

TI A computational high-throughput search for new ternary superalloys
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB In 2006, a novel cobalt-based superalloy was discovered [1] with mechanical properties better than some conventional nickel-based superalloys. As with conventional superalloys, its high performance arises from the precipitate-hardening effect of a coherent L1(2) phase, which is in two-phase equilibrium with the fcc matrix. Inspired by this unexpected discovery of an L1(2) ternary phase, we performed a first principles search through 2224 ternary metallic systems for analogous precipitate-hardening phases of the form X-3[A(0.5),B-0.5], where X = Ni, Co, or Fe, and [A,B] = Li, Be, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn Ga, Sr, Y, Zr, Nb, Mo, Tc, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, Cd, In, Sn, Sb, Hf, Ta, W, Re, Os, Ir, Pt, Au, Hg, or Tl. We found 102 systems that have a smaller decomposition energy and a lower formation enthalpy than the Co-3(Al, W) superalloy. They have a stable two-phase equilibrium with the host matrix within the concentration range 0 < x < 1 (X-3[A(x),B1-x]) and have a relative lattice mismatch with the host matrix of less than or equal to 5%. These new candidates, narrowed from 2224 systems, suggest possible experimental exploration for identifying new superalloys. Of these 102 systems, 37 are new; they have no reported phase diagrams in standard databases. Based on cost, experimental difficulty, and toxicity, we limit these 37 to a shorter list of six promising candidates of immediate interest. Our calculations are consistent with current experimental literature where data exists. (C) 2016 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Co-based superalloy, ECY768, applied on gas turbine vanes, shows the presence of cracks after service. EBSD studies revealed hcp transformation in the base material near cracked regions. This phase arises from a martensitic transformation of fcc matrix and bestows high fragility. The phase transformation is related to temperature and loading distribution that characterises components in service. However, at the service temperatures, the hcp transformation is not expected for ECY768. An in-house thermodynamic database was developed using the Calphad approach and thermodynamic calculations were applied to the complicated alloy composition for phase stability range evaluation. Moreover, a testing campaign was planned to artificially create this martensitic transformation and to comprehend the influence of plastic strain on fcc-hcp transformation. The transformation mechanisms were understood and some methods were developed for hcp-phase removal through refurbishment heat treatment.

AB Blades and vanes made from Ni - and Co - base superalloys that are used in the hot section of all gas turbine engines are coated to enhance resistance to hot corrosion. The most widely used coatings are those based on the intermetallic compounds NiAl and CoAl, which are formed by diffusion interaction of aluminium with surfaces of the nickel and cobalt alloys, respectively. Simple aluminide coatings resist high - temperature oxidation by the formation of protective layer of alumina and can be used up to about 1 150 degrees C. The coatings degrade by loss of aluminium due to spalling of oxides under thermal cycling conditions. HPT blades of DV - 2 jet engines are made from Ni - based superalloy ZS6K. For improving alloy's high temperature resistance are blades coated with Al - Si diffusion layer. Depending on jet engine flying regime an overcrossing of working temperature may occur. It may result into coarsening of the gamma prime particles, thus decreasing its strengthening effect. A real case study of DV-2 jet engine turbine blades after high temperature exposition is discussed in this article. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The main idea of alloy design is to reduce costs and time required by the traditional (trial and error) method, then finding a new way to develop the efficiency of the alloy design is necessary. In this study, we proposed a new approach to the design of Co-based alloys. It is based on the concept that lowering the ratio of stable and unstable stacking fault energy (SFE) could bring a significant increase in the tendency of partial dislocation accumulation and FCC to HCP phase transformation then enhance mechanical properties. Through the advance development of the computing techniques, first-principles density-functional-theory (DFT) calculations are capable of providing highly accurate structural modeling at the atomic scale without any experimental data. The first-principles calculated results show that the addition of some transition metal (Cr, Mo, W, Re, Os, Ir) and rare-earth (Sc, Y, La, Sm) alloying elements would decrease both stable and unstable SFE of pure Co. The dominant deformation mechanism of binary Co-4.5 at.% X (X = alloying element) is extended partial dislocation. Our study reveals Re, W, Mo and La as the most promising alloying additions for the Co-based alloys design with superior performances. Furthermore, the underlying mechanisms for the SFE reduction can be explained regarding the electronic structure.

The effect of bonding time and solid-state homogenisation time on the microstructure and mechanical properties of samples was investigated. The results showed that isothermal solidification was completed within 30 min at a constant temperature of 1180 degrees C. With increasing homogenisation time, at 1000 degrees C, a more uniform distribution of alloying elements and hardness profile across the joint region was achieved. The average shear strength of homogenised samples was about 72% that of the base metal at the same heat treatment cycle.

AB Electrical resonance based eddy current methods are being investigated and developed for the detection of sub-millimeter surface defects in low conductivity material such as superalloy in aircraft. The probe has high sensitivity due to the noise elimination by evaluate the relative resonance shift on the impedance change cause by material properties variance. This method has reported analytically with experimental validation recently. In this paper, the detecting system includes the coil sensor and the coaxial connection is modelled using full wave electromagnetic simulation with integration of the circuit co-simulator. The finite element simulation is to study the probe behavior while the circuit model simulator is used to investigate the influence of the component such as capacitance and resistance in the detection system. With our model, further investigation on the sensitivity of the detection system due to the variation of sensor parameters, such as ferrite core and liftoff as well as and capacitance and effective resistance from the electronic component, is performed. This study not only contributes to the optimization and sensitivity enhancement of the detecting system, but also provide accurate detection of submillimeter defect.

AB To meet the requirements of 700 degrees C ultra-supercritical (USC) coal-fired power plants, a new Ni-Fe based alloy (GH984G) has been developed. GH984G has excellent creep strength, thermal stability and resistance to oxidation/corrosion. Harmful phases were not observed even if after thermal exposure at 650-750 degrees C for 35,000 h. After exposure at 700 degrees C for 30,000 h, the yield strength has no obvious change. Its 105 h creep strength at 700 degrees C is up to 137 MPa and comparable to the level of 617B. The oxidation/corrosion evaluate at 700-800 degrees C up to 2000 h shows that it can meet the requirements of 700 degrees C USC coal-fired power plants. Currently, the pipes and tubes with different sizes have been manufactured. Moreover, it is an economic alloy due to the elimination of Co and containing more than 20% Fe. This makes it an interesting alternative for 700 degrees C USC coal-fired power plants and is now being evaluated at test platform for key components of China.

The main requirements on the Co superalloys are high temperature and corrosion resistance. To produce complex structures, it is necessary to join these alloys. In this work, Co-based brazing fillers for high temperature service conditions are developed. The influence of different alloying elements on the melting behavior as well as on the microstructure is investigated. A melting temperature below 1200 degrees C is achieved via addition of Ti to the near eutectic alloy CoZrTaC9, developed in previous studies. Brazing tests are carried out on the Co-based superalloy Mar M 509 using induction heating. The mechanical properties are determined by tensile tests at room temperature and at an elevated temperature of 850 degrees C. The fracture morphology of the tensile samples is investigated by light microscopy as well as SEM.

TI Looking for New Polycrystalline MC-Reinforced Cobalt-Based Superalloys
   Candidate to Applications at 1200 degrees C
SO ADVANCES IN MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
AB For applications for which temperatures higher than 1150 degrees C can be encountered the currently best superalloys, the gamma/gamma' single crystals, cannot be used under stress because of the disappearance of their reinforcing gamma' precipitates at such temperatures which are higher than their solvus. Cobalt-based alloys strengthened by refractory and highly stable carbides may represent an alternative solution. In this work the interest was focused on MC carbides of several types. Alloys were elaborated with atomically equivalent quantities in M element (among Ti, Ta, Nb, Hf, or Zr) and in C. Script-like eutectic TiC, TaC, NbC, HfC, and ZrC carbides were successfully obtained in the interdendritic spaces. Unfortunately, only one type, HfC, demonstrated high morphological stability during about 50 hours at 1200 degrees C. The concerned alloy, of the Co-25Cr-0.5C-7.4Hf type (in wt.%), was further characterized in flexural creep resistance and air-oxidation resistance at the same temperature. The creep behaviour was very good, notably by comparison with amore classical Co-25Cr-0.5C-7.5Ta alloy, proving that the interest of HfC is higher than the TaC one. In contrast the oxidation by air was faster and its behaviour not really chromia-forming. Significant improvements of this chemical resistance are expected before taking benefit from the mechanical superiority of this alloy.

TI Microstructural characterization of the M23C6 carbide in a long-term
   aged Ni-based superalloy
SO PHILOSOPHICAL MAGAZINE LETTERS
AB The microstructural features of M23C6 carbide in a long-term aged heat- and corrosion-resistant Ni-based superalloy have been investigated in detail using various kinds of transmission electron microscope (TEM) techniques. It is found that TEM contrast, which is related to structural and chemical inhomogeneities inside the grains, always exists in the interior of grains in the alloy. The structure of these inhomogeneous regions has been determined to be the same as that of the and t-M23C6 phases, where t-M23C6 indicates a transitional and metastable phase. Although possessing the same structure as the M23C6 phase, the chemical composition of the t-M23C6 is different from that of the M23C6 phase. Compared with M23C6, t-M23C6 is richer in Ni, Co, Al and Ti but poorer in W, Mo and Cr. This phenomenon of structural and chemical inhomogeneity demonstrates that pristine M23C6 carbide (p-M23C6) precipitated in standard heat-treated samples is unstable. Therefore, upon long-term ageing treatment, Ni, Co, Al and Ti may locally enrich inside the p-M23C6 phase, finally forming the phase, which can be described by the decomposition reaction p-M23C6M23C6+.

   Alloy Processing
SO RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF NON-FERROUS METALS
AB The results of electrochemical processing of the ZhS32-VI refractory alloy implemented in a galvanostatic mode in the nitric acid electrolyte are described. Experiments on the electrochemical dissolution of the same alloy in the galvanostatic mode using a nitric acid solution with a concentration of 100 g/L at various current densities are carried out. It is shown that its constituent components separate quantitatively: refractory metals such as niobium, tantalum, molybdenum, and tungsten concentrate in the anodic slime, while partially cobalt and rhenium, as well as most of the aluminum, chromium, and nickel, transfer into the electrolyte. The functional process diagram for processing of the ZhS32-VI alloy is proposed, in which the formation and separation of the main mass of nickel and cobalt are performed at the first stage with the formation of the metallic Ni-Co-containing sediment.

TI Activity coefficients of NiO and CoO in CaO-Al2O3-SiO2 slag and their
   application to the recycling of Ni-Co-Fe-based end-of-life superalloys
   via remelting
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MINERALS METALLURGY AND MATERIALS
AB To design optimal pyrometallurgical processes for nickel and cobalt recycling, and more particularly for the end-of-life process of Ni-Co-Fe-based end-of-life (EoL) superalloys, knowledge of their activity coefficients in slags is essential. In this study, the activity coefficients of NiO and CoO in CaO-Al2O3-SiO2 slag, a candidate slag used for the EoL superalloy remelting process, were measured using gas/slag/metal equilibrium experiments. These activity coefficients were then used to consider the recycling efficiency of nickel and cobalt by remelting EoL superalloys using CaO-Al2O3-SiO2 slag. The activity coefficients of NiO and CoO in CaO-Al2O3-SiO2 slag both show a positive deviation from Raoult's law, with values that vary from 1 to 5 depending on the change in basicity. The activity coefficients of NiO and CoO peak in the slag with a composition near B = (%CaO)/(%SiO2) = 1, where B is the basicity. We observed that controlling the slag composition at approximately B = 1 effectively reduces the cobalt and nickel oxidation losses and promotes the oxidation removal of iron during the remelting process of EoL superalloys.

AB A silicate ceramic and a Co-based superalloy are put in contact at 700 degrees C and are submitted to fretting wear (small amplitude reciprocating movements). The present interface is a plane to plane 4 mm contact that is studied in cross section through SEM-EDX, high resolution TEM and XPS. The tribological test results in the formation of thick (20 mu m), compact third body that adheres on both counterparts in the interface. This third body, which is formed from mixed, grinded and sintered debris reacting with surrounding oxygen, is a glaze layer. The glaze layer created on the ceramic seems homogeneous at microscale but evidences a nanostructure of metallic 20 nm crystalline grains embedded in an amorphous oxidized matrix. This structure is similar in the layer adhering on the alloy but the matrix is crystalline, suggesting that the amorphization is promoted by ceramic elements. The main wear process argued is the wrenching of metallic grains that undergo further grinding without recrystallization, associated with diffusion and selective oxidation of some metallic elements.

TI Sintering Properties and Microstructure of Fe-Ni-Co-based Superalloy
   Atomized Powder
SO RARE METAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING
AB Fe18Ni23Co25Cr21Mo8WNb3C2 superalloy powders were synthesized via an atomization method, and phase composition, morphology and thermal stability of the composite powders were characterized. Afterwards, Fe-Ni-Co-based superalloy was prepared by vacuum hot-pressing sintering and further second sintering of atomized alloy powders. The results show that the sintered Fe-Ni-Co-based superalloy mainly consists of austenite phase and M6C carbide phase that is a strengthening phase. The superalloy has uniform structure, high tensile strength and low elongation after vacuum hot-pressing sintering. After further second sintering, the microstructure of the superalloy becomes more homogeneous, the tensile strength decreases slightly and the elongation rate significantly increases.

TI Preparation and enhanced oxidation performance of a Hf-doped
   single-phase Pt-modified aluminide coating
SO CORROSION SCIENCE
AB A Hf-doped beta-(Ni,Pt)Al coating was prepared by co-deposition of a Pt-Hf composite plating and successive aluminisation. Then, a distinct Hf-rich belt was formed internally between the outer additive (Ni,Pt)Al coating and interdiffusion zone. An isothermal oxidation test at 1100 degrees C revealed a relatively lower oxidation rate constant and decreased oxide scale rumpling tendency for the Hf-doped coating during which the Hf-rich belt partly acted as an effective diffusion barrier. The unique addition of Hf into a beta-(NLPt)Al coating can delay the transitional oxidation period from transient alumina to stable one and postpone the degradation from beta to gamma'.

TI Precipitate Evolution and Creep Behavior of a W-Free Co-based Superalloy
SO METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND
   MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB The morphological and temporal evolution of (L1)-precipitates is studied in a polycrystalline Co-based superalloy (Co-30Ni-9.9Al-5.1Mo-1.9Nb at. pct) free of tungsten, aged at 1173 K (900 A degrees C). Over a heat-treatment, the morphology evolves due to precipitate coalescence. The particles grow in size and the volume fraction decreases, while there is no significant change in the microhardness value. Compressional creep tests at 1123 K (850 A degrees C) on a specimen aged at 1173 K (900 A degrees C) demonstrate that the creep resistance is comparable to the original, W-containing, higher-density Co-based superalloy (Co-9Al-9.8W at. pct). This represents the first creep study of the Co-Al-Mo-Nb-based superalloy system. The W-free alloy exhibits directional coarsening of the precipitates in the direction perpendicular to the applied compressive stress, which indicates a positive misfit. This is consistent with neutron diffraction results.

SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB The low-Pt/0.1 at.% Dy co-doped beta-NiAlCrSi coating was produced on single crystal (SC) superalloy IC21 by electro-plating of a similar to 3 mu m thick Pt film followed by electron beam physical vapour deposition (EB-PVD) of a beta-NiAlDyCrSi over layer. For comparison, the single low-Pt doped and single Dy-doped beta-NiAlCrSi coatings were also prepared, respectively. The cyclic oxidation behaviour of the above coatings at 1200 degrees C was investigated. Minor Dy-doping led to refinement of grains of the as-deposited coating. The addition of Pt effectively suppressed precipitation of topologically close-packed phase (TCP) in the interdiffusion zone (IDZ) during heat-treatment. The coupled effects of Pt/Dy co-doping led to lower oxidation rate, less scale rumpling and improved scale adherence than the single-doping cases and the related mechanisms were discussed.

The model is informed by the relationship surface between maximum nominal stress, stress ratio and fatigue life. New formulae are derived to deal with the test data for estimating the parameters of the proposed model. Fatigue tests are performed on Co-based superalloy 9CrCo subjected to constant amplitude loading at four stress ratios of -1, -0.3, 0.5 and 0.9 in three environments of room temperature (i.e., about 25 degrees C) and elevated temperatures of 530 degrees C and 620 degrees C, and the interaction mechanisms between the elevated temperature and stress ratio are deduced and compared with each other from fractographic studies. Finally, the model is applied to experimental data, demonstrating the practical and effective use of the proposed model. It is shown that new model has good correlation with experimental results.

TI Computational study of metallic dopant segregation and embrittlement at
   molybdenum grain boundaries
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB Mo and its alloys have been widely used as refractory materials owing to their excellent high temperature properties, but a critical limitation is their low ductility. Doping the grain boundaries (GBs) of Mo with metals such as Zr or Al have previously been demonstrated as a promising approach to address this shortcoming, whereas other alloy elements are known to embrittle the GBs. In this work, we investigated the segregation and strengthening/embrittling effects of 29 metallic dopants at the Sigma 5(310) tilt and Sigma 5(100) twist Mo GBs using density functional theory (DFT) calculations and empirical continuum models. In agreement with previous works for other metals, we find that the strain, as measured by the relative metallic radius versus Mo, is a good predictor of the segregation tendency, while the difference in cohesive energies between the dopant and Mo is a good predictor of the strengthening/embrittling effect. However, we find that dopant chemistry also plays a significant role in affecting segregation behavior at GBs, particularly in driving the formation of intermetallic precipitates or 2-D interfacial phases (complexions). We also show that the site preference of a dopant in the GB can lead to strengthening effects that deviate from those predicted using simple bond-breaking arguments. Assuming a fast cleavage model of fracture, Ta, Re, Os and W are predicted to have a weak strengthening effect on Mo for the Sigma 5(310) tilt GB, and Mn, Fe, Co and Nb are predicted to have reasonable strengthening effects for the Sigma 5(100) twist GB.

TI Influence of ruthenium on microstructural evolution in a model Co-Al-W

SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB The effect of 2 at.% Ru addition on the elemental partitioning and microstructural evolution of a base Co-8.8Al-7.3W at.% superalloy, consisting of a gamma-(fcc) matrix with gamma'-(L1(2) structure) precipitates is studied using scanning electron microscopy and atom-probe tomography. Ruthenium partitions to the gamma'-precipitates in the Co-9.4A1-7.5W-2.1Ru at.% alloy with a partitioning coefficient, K-Ru(gamma'/gamma) = 1.27, after aging at 900 degrees C for 16 h, in contrast to the behavior observed in Ni-base superalloys and theoretically predicted for Co-base superalloys, for which Ru partitions preferentially to the gamma-phase. The addition of ruthenium does not significantly affect the gamma' volume-fraction or the coarsening kinetics of the gamma' precipitates compared to the base ternary alloy. The addition of Ru also leads, however, to a rapid discontinuous transformation of (gamma plus gamma'), which initiates at the grain boundaries after 128 h aging at 900 degrees C; (gamma plus gamma') is transformed into a lamellar phase mixture containing Co3W (D0(19)), fcc solid-solution (gamma), and Co(Al,W) (B2). After 256 h aging at 900 degrees C in the Ru-containing alloy, some grains have completely transformed, although regions of gamma plus gamma' persist. The base ternary Co Al W alloy does not exhibit a discontinuous transformation and contains a (gamma plus gamma') microstructure up to 1024 h of aging at 900 degrees C. (C) 2016 Acta Materialia Inc.

AB Different plastic deformation thermo-mechanical terms were tried out on Ni-Al-Co-based alloy in cast, prepressed and deformed conditions, and on Ti-Al-Nb-based alloy in cast and deformed conditions by yielding specimens with varying rate of deformation in interval between 10 and 70 % and varying deformation temperature in interval between 900 and 1200 degrees.. Diagrams of tensile strength and elongation upon temperature dependence in Ni-Al-Co-based alloy in cast prepressed and deformed conditions and Ti-Al-Nb-based alloy in cast and deformed conditions are designed. Application features of protective technological coating based on glass enamel in isothermal forging of workpiece are examined. The results of heatresistance tests on Ni-Al-Co and Ti-Al-Nb-based alloys coated with different compositions of protection technological coating are shown. During the deformation these technological coatings have to be high temperature lubricant, that reduce force up to two times, necessary to deform workpiece. These protection technological coatings can be used at temperatures under 1250 degrees. The results of the work show, that optimal temperature for deformation intermetallic Ni-Al-Co-based superaloy workpiece were between 1140 and 1160 degrees.. Dropping temperature below 1140 degrees. leads to crack growing because of significant reduction of ductility. The results of the work show, that optimal temperature for deformation intermetallic Ti-Al-Nb-based workpiece were between 1150 and 1200 degrees.

TI Thermodynamic Simulation Calculation of Co-8.8Al-9.8W Alloy with
   Different B Contents Based on JMatPro Software
SO RARE METAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING
AB The precipitation behavior of Co-8.8A1-9.8W alloy with different B contents has been studied by thermodynamic simulation calculation of JMatPro software in order to research the effect of boron additions on precipitation phases of new Co base superalloy. The result shows that the precipitation temperature and precipitation quantity of gamma phase and mu-Co7W6 phase decrease with the increases of B content, whereas the precipitation temperature and precipitation quantity of eta-Co3Al phase increase. Finally, the result was explained from the aspect of boride phases and the effect of B on composition of precipitation. It suggests that with the increase of B content, the content of each element of solid-liquid equilibrium phase has a growing difference when gamma phase precipitates, and thus it is only decreasing the temperature and increasing the degree of super cooling that can satisfy gamma phase nucleation and growth. Therefore, with the increase of B content, the content of gamma phase gets less and the precipitation temperature becomes lower. The precipitation of borides leads to solid solution of much Co and W, which increases the Al content in the solid-liquid equilibrium phase and promotes the precipitation of Co3Al.

TI Phase Formation and Oxidation Behavior at 500 degrees C in a Ni-Co-Al
   Thin-Film Materials Library
SO ACS COMBINATORIAL SCIENCE
AB The complete ternary system Ni-Co-Al was fabricated as a thin film materials library by combinatorial magnetron sputtering and was annealed subsequently in several steps in Ar and under atmospheric conditions at 500 degrees C. Ni-Co-Al is the base system for both Ni- and Co-based superalloys. Therefore, the phases occurring in this system and their oxidation behavior is of high interest. The Ni-Co-Al materials library was investigated using high-throughput characterization methods such as optical measurements, resistance screening, automated EDX, automated XRD, and XPS. From the obtained data a thin film phase diagram for the Ni-Co-Al system in its state after annealing at 500 degrees C in air was established. Furthermore, a surface oxide composition map of the full Ni-Co-Al system for oxidation at 500 degrees C was concluded. As a result, it could be shown that at 500 degrees C an amount of 10 at. % Al is necessary for a Ni-Co-Al thin film to produce a protective Al-oxide scale.

TI Hot workability and microstructure control in Co20Cr15W10Ni cobalt-based
   superalloy
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Hot isothermal compression tests were conducted on Cobalt-based superalloy Co-20Cr-15W-10Ni using a thermo-mechanical simulator to study the hot workability and microstructure evolution over a wide range of temperatures and strain rates. Strain hardening was observed at lower strain rates and flow softening at higher strain rates. Microscopy revealed presence of deformation bands at a temperature of 1323 K and a strain rate of 10 s(-1); whereas at temperatures above 1423 K, fine recrystallized grains were observed at all strain rates. Dynamic recrystallization (DRX) initiates at 1373 K. At 1473 K, sudden increase in the recrystallized grain size (DDRX) is noticed, indicating grain growth. Processing maps have been developed to delineate the regions of stable and unstable metal flow during high temperature deformation. Using Ziegler's continuum principles and processing maps, regions of stable metal flow was observed in the temperature range of 1323e1500 K and strain rate range of 0.1-1 s(-1). Activation energy (Q(avg)) for the alloy was found to be 421 kJ mol(-1). As Zener Holloman parameter (Z) increases, D-DRX decreases indicating higher nucleation, restricted grain growth, when deformation resistance is high. Constitutive equation and relation between 'Z' and D-DRX for the alloy has been established. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Phase structure, morphology evolution and protective behaviors of
   chemical vapor deposited (Ni, Pt)Al coatings
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB A chemical vapor deposited (CVD) aluminizing process had been employed to deposit platinum modified aluminide coatings on the nickel-based single-crystal superalloys. The kinetics behavior, phase evolution, microstructure and chemical composition of the (Ni, Pt)Al coatings after oxidation and hot corrosion tests were studied in detail. After isothermal oxidation test, a protective alpha-Al2O3 scale is formed on the coating surface and, two new phases of (Ni, Pt)(3)Al-4 and gamma'-(Ni, Pt)(3)Al due to phase transformation reactions occur in the aluminide layer. The inward diffusion of Al element toward the substrate and, formation of micro-pores in the interface of aluminide layer and interdiffusion zone are probably the main degradation modes of the coating. Corrosive medium including of mixed of aviation fuels and artificial seawater has not serious deterioration of the coating after hot corrosion and furthermore a network of grain boundary ridges is still co-existed on the coating surface, although large of micro-pores and some of grain boundaries are appeared within the aluminide layer.

TI Stability of TaC precipitates in a Co-Re-based alloy being developed for
   ultra-high-temperature applications
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED CRYSTALLOGRAPHY
AB Co-Re alloys are being developed for ultra-high-temperature applications to supplement Ni-based superalloys in future gas turbines. The main goal of the alloy development is to increase the maximum service temperature of the alloy beyond 1473 K, i.e. at least 100 K more than the present single-crystal Ni-based superalloy turbine blades. Co-Re alloys are strengthened by carbide phases, particularly the monocarbide of Ta. The binary TaC phase is stable at very high temperatures, much greater than the melting temperature of superalloys and Co-Re alloys. However, its stability within the Co-Re-Cr system has never been studied systematically. In this study an alloy with the composition Co-17Re-23Cr-1.2Ta-2.6C was investigated using complementary methods of small-angle neutron scattering (SANS), scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and neutron diffraction. Samples heat treated externally and samples heated in situ during diffraction experiments exhibited stable TaC precipitates at temperatures up to 1573 K. The size and volume fraction of fine TaC precipitates (up to 100 nm) were characterized at high temperatures with in situ SANS measurements. Moreover, SANS was used to monitor precipitate formation during cooling from high temperatures. When the alloy is heated the matrix undergoes an allotropic phase transformation from the "phase (hexagonal close-packed) to the gamma phase (face-centred cubic), and the influence on the strengthening TaC precipitates was also studied with in situ SANS. The results show that the TaC phase is stable and at these high temperatures the precipitates coarsen but still remain. This makes the TaC precipitates attractive and the Co-Re alloys a promising candidate for high-temperature application.

TI Phase Equilibria and Microstructural Evolution in Ternary Co-Al-W
   Between 750 and 1100 A degrees C
SO JOURNAL OF PHASE EQUILIBRIA AND DIFFUSION
AB Phase equilibria between 750 and 1100 A degrees C in the Co-rich portion of the Co-Al-W ternary system are investigated via isothermal annealing of five ternary alloy compositions. At temperatures of 900 A degrees C and below, the phase diagram is dominated by a three-phase tie-triangle between gamma, D0(19), and B2. The 1000 A degrees C section contains two three-phase tie-triangles, gamma A + D0(19) + mu and gamma + B2 + mu; while only one, gamma + B2 + mu, exists at 1100 A degrees C. Results at 950 A degrees C suggest that it is possible that gamma' is in equilibrium, with four out of five compositions exhibiting microstructures supporting its thermodynamic stability, and the fifth composition containing only a very small amount of a fourth phase. However, if true, the temperature range of gamma' stability would be quite small, and it is more likely that the kinetics of gamma' dissolution are the cause of its persistence at 950 A degrees C. At 850 A degrees C, gamma' is observed to dissolve more rapidly than at 900 A degrees C where dissolution exceeds 8000 h. A time-temperature-transformation diagram constructed from the combined results exhibits a classic nose-shape indicative of the tradeoff between thermodynamics and kinetics. This further supports a small driving force as the reason for the persistence of gamma' in the microstructures of Co-Al-W alloys at 900 and 950 A degrees C. The measured equilibrium phase compositions and five corresponding isothermal sections of the phase diagram will provide essential data for constructing a new thermodynamic description of ternary Co-Al-W.

TI Oxidation and Hot Corrosion Behavior of Plasma-Sprayed MCrAlY-Cr2O3
   Coatings
SO JOURNAL OF THERMAL SPRAY TECHNOLOGY
AB The oxidation and hot corrosion behavior of two atmospheric plasma-sprayed NiCoCrAlY-Cr2O3 and CoNiCrAlY-Cr2O3 coatings, which are primarily designed for wear applications at high temperature, were investigated in this study. The two coatings were exposed to air and molten salt (75%Na2SO4-25%NaCl) environment at 800 A degrees C under cyclic conditions. Oxidation and hot corrosion kinetic curves were obtained by thermogravimetric technique. X-ray diffraction analysis and scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive x-ray spectrometry were employed to characterize the coatings' microstructure, surface oxides, and composition. The results showed that both coatings provided the necessary oxidation resistance with oxidation rates of about 1.03 x 10(-2) and 1.36 x 10(-2) mg/cm(2) h, respectively. The excellent oxidation behavior of these two coatings is attributed to formation of protective (Ni,Co)Cr2O4 spinel on the surface, while as-deposited Cr2O3 in the coatings also acted as a barrier to diffusion of oxidative and corrosive substances. The greater presence of Co in the CoNiCrAlY-Cr2O3 coating restrained internal diffusion of sulfur and slowed down the coating's degradation. Thus, the CoNiCrAlY-Cr2O3 coating was found to be more protective than the NiCoCrAlY-Cr2O3 coating under hot corrosion condition.

TI Reactive co-sputter deposition and properties of CrAlSiN hard films for
   enhancement of cutting tools
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REFRACTORY METALS & HARD MATERIALS
AB This paper evaluates chromium aluminum silicon nitride (CrAlSiN) hard films fabricated using reactive magnetron co-sputter with adjusted deposition parameters. The hard films were prepared on glass and tungsten carbide tools at a substrate temperature of 350 degrees C. The targets were Cr, W and Si, with 40 sccm Ar as the plasma gas and 40 sccm N-2 as the reactive gas. An orthogonal array, the signal-to-noise ratio and analysis of variance are used to analyze the effect of the deposition parameters. Using the Taguchi method for design of a robust experiment, the interactions between factors are also investigated. The main deposition parameters, such as Cr direct current (DC) power (reverse time 5 mu s), Al DC power (reverse time 5 mu s), Si radio frequency (RF) power, and bias the substrates with RF power, were optimized, with regard to the microstructure, morphology, mechanical and tribological properties of CrAlSiN films. The results of this study show that the substrate bias has the most significant effect on hardness. The experimental results also show that the Taguchi method allows a suitable solution to the problem, with the minimum number of trials compared to a full factorial design. With the optimized CrAlSiN hard films deposition conditions, the hardness, Young's modulus and friction coefficient were 31.26 Gpa, 258.58 Gpa and 0.50, respectively. Further, this study also investigates the properties of machining MAR-M247 nickel-based superalloy, testing differently coated tools in dry conditions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The compositional and order-disorder transition widths of gamma'/gamma interfaces in a Co-Al-W alloy have been established for the first time by coupling of aberration corrected high resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy and orientation-specific atom probe tomography. While the compositional width is approximately 2.5 nm, the order-disorder transition width is very sharp measuring 0.5 nm. A comparative study revealed that the gamma'/gamma interfaces, in a model Ni-Al-Cr alloy, are both compositionally and structurally diffuse with nearly the same width (-2.5-3 nm). These differences between the gamma'/gamma interfaces in Co and Ni-base alloys can impact the coarsening behavior of the ordered precipitates. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI On the role of processing parameters in sintered new Co-based (W,Al)
   alloys
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB The demand for enhanced material performance and efficiency in high-temperature applications has motivated the development of novel Co-based superalloys. Co-Al-W-based superalloys with the gamma/gamma' structure have suitable properties for use at high temperature and are good candidates for replacing Ni-based superalloys in some applications. The current generation of Co-Al-W-based alloys has superior wear, corrosion, and oxidation resistance. The poor precipitation strengthening of these alloys compared to that of Ni-based superalloys can be overcome by designing the alloying system to promote gamma'-Co-3(Al, W) precipitation. In this work, the compositions of the selected Co-Al-W-based alloys were chosen because they improve the precipitation strengthening of the alloys. Starting from powders, the materials were fabricated by mechanical alloying (MA) and subsequently consolidated by field assisted hot pressing (FAHP). The prepared Co-Al-W superalloys have a large amount of well-dispersed nanoprecipitates in their microstructures and have nearly full density. The effects of the MA and consolidation process (FAHP) conditions on the microstructures and mechanical properties of selected samples are determined by comparing the samples. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TI MICROSTRUCTURE EVOLUTION AND INTERFACIAL FORMATION MECHANISM OF WIDE GAP
   BRAZING OF DD5 SINGLE CRYSTAL SUPERALLOY
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB Ni-based single-crystal superalloy DD5 has excellent high temperature properties, which is the preferred raw material for aero-engine turbine blade in recent year. In this research, DD5 superalloy was brazed by different contents of Ni-Co-Cr-W-B+DD99 mixed powder filler alloy. The microstructure evolution and interfacial formation mechanism of DD5 superalloy brazing joint were analyzed by SEM and EPMA. The mechanical properties of joint after solid solution treatment and aging treatment were tested. The results show that gamma-Ni primary phase formed firstly in the Ni-Co-Cr-W-B/DD99 interface during the brazing process, and then B element segregated and precipitated to fine granular M3B2 type boride. The residual liquid phase solidified and formed lastly to the M3B2 phase, gamma+gamma' eutectic phase and gamma-Ni+Ni3B+CrB eutectic phase during cooling. With increasing the ratio of DD99 in mixed powder filler alloy, the low melting point eutectic phase and borides in the joint decrease and the uniformity of composition and microstructure of joint improve. When the ratio of DD99 increased to 70% (mass fraction) in the mixed powder filler alloy, it can be observed that element of B diffused to DD99 additive powder which resulted in the decrease of low melting point eutectic phases and brittle compounds. The high temperature tensile properties of joint is 1010 MPa at 870 degrees C.

TI The Minor Precipitation at the Final Stage of U720Li Solidification
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA-ENGLISH LETTERS
AB The minor precipitations caused by B and Zr which are the normal constituents of U720Li alloy have been studied by analyzing the solidification process and the composition evolution. The present study aims to supply the elementary information about the existing form of B and Zr in the as-cast microstructure, which is helpful for the subsequent processing, such as homogenization treatment. The M3B2 and Ni5Zr phases were observed in the U720Li alloy in as-cast state, which were usually accompanying with each other together with eta-Ni3Ti phase at the edge of eutectic (gamma + gamma'). Combining the DTA analysis and heating and quenching tests, the solidification sequence was determined to be the following: gamma matrix, eutectic (gamma + gamma'), eta-Ni3Ti, M3B2 and Ni5Zr. The in situ composition analysis by EDS and EPMA revealed that the precipitation and microstructure were governed by the composition evolution in the liquids. The solidification of gamma matrix increased the Ti concentration in the residual liquids and resulted in the eutectic (gamma + gamma') formation; the (gamma + gamma') formation increased the Ti/Al radio in the liquids and the eta-Ni3Ti was formed in front of the eutectic (gamma + gamma'); the eta-Ni3Ti precipitation consumed up Al and Ti and increased the concentration of B, Mo and Cr, and M3B2 boride is formed; the previous precipitation of the phases consumed up most of the elements other than Ni and Zr, and Ni5Zr is formed finally. The melting points are in the ranges of 1130-1140 degrees C for Ni5Zr phase, 1180-1190 degrees C for M3B2 boride and 1190-1200 degrees C for eta-Ni3Ti phase.

TI Atom site preference and gamma '/gamma mismatch strain in Ni-Al-Co-Ti
   superalloys
SO INTERMETALLICS
AB The structure and chemistry of Ni-Co-Al-Ti quaternary superalloys are investigated at the micro structural and atomic scale. Atom probe tomograghy (APT) is used to quantify phase compositions and elemental partitioning behavior. Using aberration corrected electron microscopy, the site occupancy of the atoms within the A(3) B structure (L1(2)-type) gamma' phase is determined via atomic resolution energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). Ni is observed to preferentially occupy the A sub-lattice positions for all alloys, while Al and Ti occupy the B sub-lattice. In contrast, Co's site preference changes from a random distribution to the A sub-lattice as the alloy composition changes, in agreement with theoretical predictions from literature. Finally, the lattice strain across the 771, interfaces is measured as a function of alloy composition. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI An investigation of diffusion-mediated cyclic coarsening and reversal
   coarsening in an advanced Ni-based superalloy
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB The anomalous cyclic coarsening behaviour of gamma' precipitates after ageing at 1073 K has been investigated for the low misfit commercial powder metallurgy (PM) Ni-based superalloy RR1000. Using scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) imaging combined with absorption-corrected energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy, the elemental segregation as a function of coarsening behaviour has been experimentally observed for secondary gamma' precipitates. Elemental EDX spectrum imaging has revealed nanoscale enrichment of Co and Cr and a depletion of Al and Ti within the gamma matrix close to the gamma-gamma' interface. Our experimental results, coupled with complementary modelling and synchrotron X-ray diffraction analysis, demonstrate the importance of elastic strain energy resulting from local compositional variations for influencing precipitate morphology. In particular, elemental inhomogeneities, as a result of complex diffusive interactions within both matrix and precipitates, play a crucial role in determining the rate of coarsening. Our findings provide important new evidence for understanding the microstructural evolution observed for advanced superalloys when they are exposed to different heat treatment regimes.

TI CYCLIC OXIDATION AND HOT CORROSION BEHAVIORS OF A GRADIENT NiCoCrAlYSi
   COATING
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB MCrAlY (M=Ni and/or Co) coatings are widely used as overlays or bond coats for thermal barrier coatings due to their good performance against high temperature oxidation and hot corrosion. Usually, high Al content in the MCrAlY coatings can benefit the performance and lifetimes of the coatings. However, MCrAIY coatings usually contain only restricted Al content because high Al content might lead to brittleness and potential crack. Design of gradient coating can be used to solve the problem, since it can provide a balance between high Al content and high stress bearing ability. Therefore, much attention has been paid to coatings with gradient structures, and these coatings show good oxidation and corrosion resistance. In this work, a gradient and a conventional NiCoCrAlYSi coating were prepared by arc ion plating technique and subsequent annealing treatment. Cyclic oxidation tests of the two coatings were carried out between room temperature and 1000 degrees C. The hot corrosion tests of the coatings were performed in two different mixed salts of 75%Na2SO4+25%K2SO4 and 75%Na2SO4+25%NaCl (mass fraction) at 900 degrees C. The results indicated that the gradient coating possessed a graded distribution of Al-rich outer layer and Cr-rich inner layer after annealing treatment, and it showed better performance of re-healing alumina scale due to its possession of more beta phase as Al reservoir during the cyclic oxidation. The degradation process of the gradient coating was favorably retarded by the formation of Cr(W, Re)-rich precipitates in the interdiffusion zone. In sulphates, the two coatings showed good corrosion resistance. The presence of NaCl aggravated the corrosion extent of the two coatings. Compared with the conventional coating, the gradient coating postponed the formation of internal oxidation and sulfidation, resulting from the gradient distribution of Al-enriched outer layer and Cr-enriched inner layer.

TI Influence of welding on low cycle fatigue properties of Co-based
   superalloy FSX-414
SO TRANSACTIONS OF NONFERROUS METALS SOCIETY OF CHINA
AB Co-based superalloys such as FSX-414 have been recently used in gas turbine first stage nozzles. During service, nozzles are exposed to low cycle fatigue, which can lead to cracking of these components. The cracks on these nozzles are usually welded with tungsten arc welding (TIG) using Co-based filler metals. In this paper, the effect of TIG on the tensile and low cycle fatigue properties of Co-based superalloy FSX-414 was studied at 950 degrees C. The experimental results show that the yield and ultimate tensile stresses of welded and unwelded specimens are comparable to each other. But toughness of welded specimens is lower than that of unwelded ones. The low cycle fatigue properties of FSX-414 were studied at a strain rate of 3.3x10(-4) s(-1), strain ratio R=-1 (R=epsilon(min)/epsilon(max)) and Delta epsilon(t) (total strain change) from 0.8% to 2%. In welded specimens, at high strain cycling, the nucleation and growth of cracks occur in the welded zone. But at Delta epsilon(t)=0.8%, fracture occurs in the same zones of unwelded specimens. The results show that the total fatigue lives of the welded specimens are shorter than those of unwelded ones. In all of the low cycle fatigue tests, softening phenomena are observed.

TI Effect of configuration and composition of interlayer on TLP joints of
   FSX-414 superalloy
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY
AB Different interlayers including commercial foils of MBF-80, MBF-60 and MBF-100 with the thickness of 50 pm and pure Ni-coating with the thickness of 10 mu m were used for TLP bonding of FSX-414 superalloy. TLP bonding was conducted at the optimum condition (1150 degrees C/5 min). The joints microstructures were studied using SEM and WDS/SEM was used for phase analysis. For MBF-80 interlayer, no eutectic phases were seen at the joint but some granular and needle-like phases were visible at the diffusion affected zone. Considerable amount of eutectic phases were visible at the joint made using MBF-60 interlayer which were identified as NiP2 and CrP. These phases were detected for MBF-100 interlayer as Co and Cr-rich borides. Isolated eutectic phases, analysed as Ni, Co, Cr and W-rich ones, were seen at the joints made using pure Ni-coating as the interlayer. Mechanical tests including microhardness and shear strength were conducted for all the samples. The highest shear strength and the lowest hardness of eutectic compounds were observed for the joints made using MBF-80 interlayer. This was in agreement with the lowest concentration of alloying elements at these compounds, obtained from SEM/WDS analysis. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SO CORROSION SCIENCE
AB Low-Pt/Hf co-doped beta-NiAlCrSi and Hf single-doped beta-NiAlCrSi coatings were produced onto advanced single crystal (SC) superalloy IC21 containing Mo, respectively. The cyclic oxidation and interdiffusion behaviour of the coatings at 1200 degrees C were investigated. As compared to the single-doped coating, the co-doped coating revealed suppressed interdiffusion and delayed beta-gamma' phase transformation. Simultaneously, the interfacial voids formation and scale rumpling were inhibited. As a result, the thermally grown oxide (TGO) grown on the co-doped coating exhibited improved adherence and the roles of Pt and Hf in low-Pt/Hf co-doped coating were discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The isothermal oxidation behaviour of a series of quinary Ni-Co-Al-Ti-Cr alloys were studied at 800 A degrees C. Alloys with higher Cr concentrations exhibited lower mass gain after 100-h exposure, as did the alloys richest in Ni and Al for a given Cr concentration. Extensive internal oxidation and nitridation was also observed in all alloys, except those containing the highest concentrations of Ni and Al. All alloys studied generated continuous chromium oxide layers, beneath which alumina particles were observed. Compositional analysis of the subscales identified shallower Cr concentration gradients in alloys containing equiatomic levels of Ni and Co, suggesting increased availability of Cr in the alloy. Thermodynamic calculations confirmed that these alloys contained higher concentrations of Cr in their gamma matrices as a result of a combination of both the elemental partitioning behaviour and the increased mole fraction of gamma' precipitates forming in the alloy.

TI Thermal expansion behavior of new Co-based alloys and implications for
   coatings
SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB The thermal expansion behavior of five gamma'-(L1(2)) containing Co-based superalloys was measured using push-rod dilatometry. These results were analyzed to determine the mean coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), the instantaneous CTE, and gamma'-solvus temperature of the alloys. The CTE was found to depend strongly on the gamma'-solvus temperature.
   In turbine applications, these alloys will be part of a multilayer system that generates thermal stresses due to the CTE mismatch between the components. To investigate this phenomenon, the CTE data was incorporated into a thermo-mechanical model to calculate the energy release rate (ERR) for the delamination of coatings from these alloys. The ERR of a thermally grown oxide (TGO) formed on the bare and bond coated Co-based alloys was determined as a function of superalloy and bond coat CTE. The ERR of a thermal barrier coating (TBC) was evaluated as a function of temperature, superalloy LIE, and coating thickness. The ERR was found to be about 1.5 x greater in Co-based superalloys compared to Ni-based superalloys cooled from T = 1100 degrees C to ambient. Strategies for reducing the driving force for delamination are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Effects of grain refinement on cast structure and tensile properties of
   superalloy K4169 at high pouring temperature
SO CHINA FOUNDRY
AB In order to improve the filling ability of large complex thin wall castings, the pouring temperature should be increased, but this will result in the grain coarsening. To overcome this problem, two kinds of grain refiners of Co-Fe-Nb and Cr-Fe-Nb ternary alloys, which contain high stability compound particles, were prepared. The effects of the refiners on the as-cast structures and tensile properties of the K4169 superalloy with different casting conditions were studied by analyzing specimens 110 mm long and 20 mm in diameter. Results showed that the mixture addition of the two refiners in the melt of K4169 can reduce the columnar grain region and decrease the equiaxed grain size greatly. After refinement, the amount of Laves phase decreases and its morphology changes from island to blocky structure. The carbides in the fine grain samples are fine and dispersive. Meanwhile, the porosity in specimens is decreased due to grain refinement. As a result, the yield strength, ultimate strength and the elongation of the specimens are increased. The grain refinement mechanisms are also discussed.

TI Diffusion of solutes in fcc Cobalt investigated by diffusion couples and
   first principles kinetic Monte Carlo
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB The interdiffusivity of Al and the transition metal solutes Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Nb, Mo, Ru, Ta, W, and Re in fcc Co is characterized at 1373 K, 1473 K and 1573 K by binary diffusion couples. The experimental results are complemented by first-principles calculations in combination with kinetic Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the diffusion of Re, W, Mo and Ta in fcc Co. The interdiffusion coefficients of alloying elements in fcc Co are generally smaller than in fcc Ni, but the correlation between interdiffusion coefficients and the atomic number of metal solutes is comparable in Co and Ni. With increasing atomic number and decreasing atomic radii the interdiffusion coefficients of the investigated elements, except for Mn and Fe, decrease strongly. The trends in the diffusivity determined by experiment and simulation are in excellent agreement. Re is the slowest diffusing element in fcc Co among the investigated elements. The electronic structure calculations indicate that this is caused by strong directional bonds between Re and neigh-boring Co atoms. The overall lower diffusivity of solute atoms in Co as compared to Ni suggests that diffusion controlled processes could be slower in Co-base superalloys. (C) 2016 Acta Materialia Inc.

SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB In Ni-base superalloys, the addition of refractory elements such as Cr, Mo, Co, W, and Re is necessary to increase the creep resistance. Nevertheless, these elements induce the formation of different kinds of intermetallic phases, namely, the topologically close-packed (TCP) phases. This work focuses on intermetallic phases present in the second-generation single-crystal (SX) Ni-base superalloy ERBO/1. In the as-cast condition, the typical gamma/gamma' structure is accompanied by undesirable intermetallic phases located in the interdendritic regions. The nature of these precipitates as well as their thermal stability between 800 and 1200 A degrees C has been investigated by isothermal heat treatments. The investigation techniques include DSC, SEM, EDX, and TEM. The experimental information is complemented by (1) comparison with a structure map to link the local chemical composition with phase stability, as well as (2) thermodynamic calculations based on the CALPHAD method to determine the occurrence and composition of phases during solidification and in equilibrium conditions. The TCP phases Laves, A mu and sigma were identified in various temperature/time ranges.

SO PHILOSOPHICAL MAGAZINE
AB The purpose of the present study is to introduce the weld quantitative solidification paths in the newly designed third-generation superalloys. The research has been conducted using both computational and experimental approaches. The model used the Scheil solidification relations to correlate the partitioning elements with their effects on the solidification paths. Accordingly, the k values were calculated for all the participating elements in the superalloy welds. The results of model demonstrated that these were very close to unity for austenite former elements, i.e. Ni, Co, Cr and Fe, while the other elements such as Ti, Nb and Mo displayed a significant tendency for segregation. The mathematical equations were calculated for weld solidification paths of superalloys. In all the welds, a remarkable segregation behaviour was observed, especially for Nb and Ti. The solidification path equations predicted type and amount of secondary phases. The solidification paths were compared with eutectic reactions on the basis of the Ni-Ti-C and Ni-Nb-C ternary phase diagrams. Both the experimental measurements and microstructural observations of eutectics exhibited an appropriate accordance with the solidification paths obtained by model calculations.

SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB Co-based alloy has high strength, good corrosion and wear resistance, and is widely used in aviation industry, nuclear industry. The cast Co-based alloys has high hardness brittleness, but the toughness is low, which limits its wide use. The CoCrW alloy prepared by powder metallurgy process has high toughness, at the same time, the mechanical properties of the CoCrW alloy can be changed by heat treatment. In this work, the effect of solid solution treatment on the microstructure and mechanical properties of the hot pressed alloy was studied by SEM, XRD and TEM, hardness test, room-temperature tensile and wear experiment. The results show that the microstructure of the as-hot pressed and solid solution state CoCrW alloy are both composed of M23C6, M6C, CrCo intermetallic compounds and gamma-Co matrix, the contents of M23C6 and prior particle boundaries decrease remarkably after solution treatment, meanwhile, the toughness and wear resistance of the alloy are improved. With the increase of solid solution temperature and time, the hardness and tensile strength at room temperature of CoCrW alloys increase first and then decrease.

SO MATERIALS CHARACTERIZATION
AB In order to develop Co-based oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) superalloys with excellent mechanical properties and oxidation resistance at the temperature above 1000 degrees C, Co-20Cr-(5,10)Al ODS superalloys were designed and fabricated by mechanical alloying (MA), spark plasma sintering (SPS), hot rolling and the final annealing at 1200 degrees C. Two different phases were identified; the Co solid solution of a fcc structure, and the B2 phase highly enriched with Aluminum. Composition and volume fraction of both phases are almost consistent with the Co-Cr-Al ternary phase diagram computed with the Pandat software. Another coarse fcc phase with smaller content of oxide particles was also characterized. This phase was probably formed through an incipient melting at the initial stage of SPS process. Fine oxides particles are densely distributed inside both, the fcc solid solution and the B2 phase. Grain boundaries and phase boundaries are decorated with the oxide particles, which are beneficial to grains and phases stability at elevated temperature. The observed unique core-shell structure was characterized as Y2Hf7O17 type in a core and Y2Hf2O7 type at a periphery of the oxide particles. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Effect of Heat Treatment on the Microstructure and Properties of
   HVOF-Sprayed Co-Cr-W Coating
SO JOURNAL OF THERMAL SPRAY TECHNOLOGY
AB Co-Cr-W HVOF-sprayed protective coatings are used for their high oxidation and wear resistance. Apart from the oxidation resistance, the stability of their mechanical properties in relation to thermal loading is crucial with respect to the most common high-temperature application areas. This work is focused mainly on evaluation of the heat-induced changes in the phase composition and related mechanical properties. It was shown that the original powder, composed fully from face-centered cubic Co-based alloy, partly changes its phase composition during spraying to a hexagonal close-packed (hcp) structure. The annealing further increases the ratio of the hcp phase in the structure. The heat-induced phase changes are accompanied by an increase in the coatings' hardness and cohesion strength. The abrasive and adhesive wear behavior was evaluated. While the coatings' heat treatment had a positive effect on the coefficient of friction, the abrasive and adhesive wear resistance of annealed coating was lower compared to as-sprayed coating.

AB The purpose of this study was to produce Co-based Stellite 6 superalloy components by using the method of Powder Injection Molding (PIM) and to characterize the microstructural and mechanical properties of the produced components. The experimental studies were started through the formation of feedstock by mixing Stellite 6 powder with a multicomponent binder system. Prepared feedstock was formed by utilizing powder injection molding technique. Then the molded samples were subjected to the solvent and thermal debinding processes. Different sintering cycles were applied to the raw components for the purpose of determining the optimum sintering conditions. The densities of the sintered components were determined in accordance with the Archimedes' principle. The microstructural characterization was performed through scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis, energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) analyses, and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. Hardness measurement and tensile test were conducted in order to determine the mechanical properties. The results illustrated that the injection molded Stellite 6 components were composed of fine and equiaxed grains, plenty of carbide precipitates exhibiting homogenous distribution throughout the microstructure formed at the grain boundaries and thus the mechanical properties were considerably high.

AB The paper presents the transmission electron microscope (TEM) investigations of the structure of Ni-Al-Cr-based superalloy which is obtained by directional crystallization technique. The structural TEM investigations are carried out in two stages: 1) annealing at 1150 degrees C for 1 h and 2) annealing at 1100 degrees C for 480 h. The qualitative and quantitative analysis is given for the structure, phase composition and morphology of heat-resisting alloy additionally alloyed by rhenium Re both in the original state and after thermal treatment. The heat-resisting alloy comprises similar to 70 at % Ni, similar to 17 at % Al and similar to 5 at % Cr. The total amount of the primary alloying elements of Mo, W, Ta, Ti, Co, La was similar to 7 at % and 0.4.t % Re. It is shown that the structure of the superalloy is represented by (gamma+gamma')-phase mixture which has a morphologically correct crystallographic orientation and quasi-monocrystalline structure. s-phase is formed in this superalloy due to rhenium. Since Re distribution in the alloy is not uniform, only a part of (gamma+gamma')-phase quasi-cuboids is distorted. It is shown that Re modification distorts the ideal structure of (gamma+gamma')-phase quasi-cuboids and results in the formation of beta-, chi-and sigma-phases.

TI Strengths and Microstructure of SUS316L Fabricated by Selective Laser
   Melting
SO JOURNAL OF THE JAPAN INSTITUTE OF METALS AND MATERIALS
AB Recently, AM ( Additive Manufacturing) process which can produce highly complex components have been gaining significant attention in both industry and academic research. Numerous metals and alloys have been processed by selective laser melting; Ti alloys, Ni alloys, and Co-Cr alloys have been the subjects of recent work. Ni-based superalloys have precipitated phases such as gamma' and gamma '' phase and Ti alloys and Co-Cr alloys are the multiphase alloys which have phase transformation, thus it is difficult to clarify the influential factors of AM process on strengths of these alloys. In this study, we used SUS316L stainless steel which is a single-phase solid-solution alloy and does not have precipitated phase in order to clarify characteristic influential factors of AM compared with a conventional material. SUS316L was fabricated by selective laser melting by ytterbium fiber laser from fine metallic powder. It was found that the coarse columnar grains grew up along the built direction and the columnar cell structure of dislocations which are induced during the AM process. During the solution heat treatment, the dislocation recovery was observed. AM specimens showed higher tensile and creep strengths compared with the conventional (hot working) material because of the high. density of dislocations. Ductility of AM specimens was lower than the conventional material because of defects due to lack of fusion at molten pool boundaries; furthermore, the specimens whose loading direction corresponds to built direction showed lower strength and elongation than the specimens whose loading direction perpendicular to built direction due to the oriented defects.

TI Surface Microstructure of Nanoaluminized CoCrAlY Coating Irradiated by
   HCPEB
SO JOURNAL OF NANOMATERIALS
AB A thermal sprayed CoCrAlY coating was prepared by air plasma spray on the surface of Ni-based superalloy GH4169; then, a nanoscale aluminum film was deposited with electron beam vacuum deposition on it. The coatings irradiated by high-current pulsed electron beam were investigated. After HCPEB treatment, the Al film was remelted into the bond coat. XRD result shows that Al and Al2O3 phase were recorded in the irradiated and aluminized coatings, while Co-based oxides which originally existed in the initial samples disappeared. Microstructure observations reveal that the original coating with porosity, cavities, and inclusions was significantly changed after HCPEB treatment as compact appearance of interconnected bulged nodules. Moreover, the grains on the irradiated coating were very refined and homogeneously dispersed on the surface, which could effectively inhibit the corrosive gases and improve the coating oxidation resistance.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of subsurface materials on the performance of a wear-resistant thin film. The mechanical, tribological, and corrosion properties were assessed for two hybrid coating systems: (1) W-WC thin film and a laser cladded Co-Cr interlayer applied to a 316 stainless steel substrate and (2) the same W-WC thin film and a spray-and-fused Ni-W-Cr-B interlayer applied to an Inconel (R) 718 substrate. They were then compared to the same systems without an interlayer. The microstructures were analyzed by XRD, EDS, and SEM. The hardness and surface load-carrying capacity of the coating systems were determined by micro-and macrohardness testing. Rockwell indentation was used to assess coating adhesion (CEN/TS 1071-8). Tribological properties were assessed with a reciprocating tribometer, and corrosion resistance was determined by potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The originality of this work lies in the finding that, except for the Inconel 718/Ni-W-Cr-B/W-WC system, the wear rate decreases with decreasing hardness of the subsurface materials carrying the thin film due to the decreasing contact pressure for a given load. Another novel finding is the stress-induced phase transformation of the Co-Cr interlayer, which occurs beneath the thin film under high load.

TI Oxidation Resistance of a Co-Base Superalloy Improved by Pre-Oxidation
   Heat Treatment
SO JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB The influence of a pre-existing multi-oxide layer on the subsequent re-oxidation at different temperatures of a 22Co-21Ni-23Fe-29Cr- 1.6Si-1Mn superalloy was investigated. The pre-oxidation heat-treatment (PHT) at 1200 degrees C for 5 min resulted in the formation of a protective multi-oxide layer. The behavior of pre-treated and non pre-treated samples during isothermal oxidation at 800, 900 and 1000 degrees C in air was studied. Results showed that rate-constants of the oxidation processes of pre-treated samples were significantly lower than those of the non pre-treated ones. Oxidation at 800, 900 and 1000 degrees C in air for 100 h, resulted in the formation of MnCr2O4, Cr2O3 and SiO2 compounds for both kinds of samples. A diffusion-controlled mechanism is proposed to describe the oxidation process. (C) 2016 The Electrochemical Society. All rights reserved.

TI The Thermal Stability and Strength of Highly Alloyed Ni3Al
SO MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS
AB In this study the Ll(2) gamma prime phase (based on Ni3Al) has been highly alloyed with Cr, Co, W, and Ta in order to examine the effects on strengthening and thermal stability. The order-disorder transition temperature of gamma prime is decreased with higher alloying content. Thermodynamic calculations show that the ordering enthalpy decreases as the entropy term increases. Conversely, the hardness can be 1.5 times higher comparing to that of a conventional Ni-based superalloy. This indicates that the strengthening effect of designing a gamma prime composition toward higher entropy is significant, due to greater lattice distortion and higher anti-phase boundary energy of gamma prime.

TI Comparative study of the segregation behavior and crystallographic
   orientation in a nickel-based single-crystal superalloy
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB The segregation behavior and crystallographic orientation of a nickel-based single-crystal CMSX-6 superalloy produced by the downward directional solidification process have been investigated. The results were compared with those in the Bridgman process. In comparison to the Bridgman process, the fluctuations in the concentrations of Al, Ti, Ta, Co, Mo and Cr became smaller along the path from the dendrite lobe through the interdendritic region to the adjacent dendrite lobe. This suggests that the degree of the segregation of these alloying elements was reduced by using the DWDS process. In addition to this, the angle between the dendrites' preferred growth direction and the heat flow direction in the DWDS cast samples, and the splaying region were smaller than those in the Bridgman solidified samples. This indicates that better crystal orientation can be obtained in nickel-based single-crystal superalloy components by using the downward directional solidification process. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

TI RESEARCH PROGRESS IN A HIGH PERFORMANCE CAST & WROUGHT SUPERALLOY FOR
   TURBINE DISC APPLICATIONS
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB The advanced cast & wrought (C&W) superalloys for turbine disc applications have low temperature bearing capacity and poor processing ability compared with the powder metallurgy (PM) superalloys. Recently, a new kind of C&W Ni-Co base disc superalloys, named as TMW alloy, has been developed on the basis of an innovative concept. Full-scale pancakes (440 mm in diameter and 65 mm in thickness) with an average grain size of about 10 pm were successfully manufactured by a conventional C&W processing route. TMW alloys can provide 58-76 degrees C temperature advantages over alloy U720Li in 0.2% creep strain life under 630 MPa and are comparable with the advanced PM disc superalloys. In this work, the alloy design, preparation processing capacity, micro-structural control, performance characteristics and deformation strengthening mechanisms were briefly introduced.

The method we used based on the Bauschinger effect. The changes in the dendritic microstructure and chemical composition were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectrometry. The phases micromechanical properties evolution were characterized by nanoindentation. The results show that the cumulative strain or strain energy density increase arouse the interdiffusion of atoms between the different phases and the phases equilibrium in SC was changed. It is established that the interdiffusion rate depends on elements atoms activation energy. The new gamma-gamma'-eutectic pools were formed in the primary dendrites region (with fine gamma/gamma'-phase) and as result the length of newly formed dendrites was decreased significantly. The maximal and plastic depth of nanoindentation were measured and the corresponding micromechanical properties of phases calculated.

TI Microsegregation and precipitates of an as-cast Co-based
   superalloy-microstructural characterization and phase stability
   modelling
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB The demand for increased efficiency of industrial gas turbines and aero engines drives the search for the next generation of materials. Promising candidates for such new materials are Co-based superalloys. We characterize the microsegregation and solidification of a multi-component Co-based superalloy and compare it to a ternary Co-Al-W compound and to two exemplary Ni-based superalloys by combining the experimental characterization of the as-cast microstructures with complementary modelling of phase stability. On the experimental side, we characterize the microstructure and precipitates by electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and determine the element distributions and microsegregation coefficients by electron probe microanalysis (EPMA). On the modelling side, we carry out solidification simulations and a structure map analysis in order to relate the local chemical composition with phase stability. We find that the microsegregation coefficients for the individual elements are very similar in the investigated Co-based and Ni-based superalloys. By interpreting the local chemical composition from EPMA with the structure map, we effectively unite the set of element distribution maps to compound maps with very good contrast of the dendritic microstructure. The resulting compound maps of the microstructure in terms of average band filling and atomic-size difference explain the formation of topologically close-packed phases in the interdendritic regions. We identify B2, C14, and D0(24) precipitates with chemical compositions that are in line with the structure map.

TI A new class of high strength high temperature Cobalt based gamma-gamma '
   Co-Mo-Al alloys stabilized with Ta addition
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB The present paper reports a new class of Co based superalloys that has gamma-gamma' microstructure and exhibits much lower density compared to other commercially available Co superalloys including Co-Al-W based alloys. The basic composition is Co-10Al-5Mo (at%) with addition of 2 at% Ta for stabilization of gamma' phase. The gamma-gamma' microstructure evolves through solutionising and aging treatment. Using first principles calculations, we observe that Ta plays a crucial role in stabilizing gamma' phase. By addition of Ta in the basic stoichiometric composition Co-3(Al, Mo), the enthalpy of formation (Delta H-f) of L1(2) structure (gamma' phase) becomes more negative in comparison to DO19 structure. The All of the L12 structure becomes further more negative by the occupancy of Ni and Ti atoms in the lattice suggesting an increase in the stability of the gamma' precipitates. Among large number of alloys studied experimentally, the paper presents results of detailed investigations on Co-10Al-5Mo-2Ta, Co-30Ni-10Al-5Mo-2Ta and Co-30Ni-10Al-5Mo-2Ta-2Ti. To evaluate the role alloying elements, atom probe tomography investigations were carried out to obtain partition coefficients for the constituent elements. The results show strong partitioning of Ni, Al, Ta and Ti in ordered gamma' precipitates. 2015 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI A Newly Developed Wrought Ni-Fe-Cr-based Superalloy for Advanced
   Ultra-Supercritical Power Plant Applications Beyond 700 degrees C
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA-ENGLISH LETTERS
AB Some existing wrought Ni-Cr-Co-based superalloys are being evaluated as the candidate materials for advanced ultra-supercritical power plant applications beyond 700 degrees C due to their high creep strength. But they are all prohibitively expensive due to the addition of Co, Mo and W. Here we developed a new Ni-Fe-Cr-based superalloy (named as HT700 alloy) with low cost and high strength. This paper reports the mechanical properties and fracture modes of HT700 alloy to support its high temperature applications and to understand prospective failure mechanism. Fracto-graphic examinations indicate that the fracture modes shift with test condition change. In addition, the HT700 alloy has relatively stable microstructure at 750 degrees C. Compared with IN740 and GH2984 alloys, this new alloy has higher yield strength in the temperature range from room temperature to 800 degrees C. The creep life of this new alloy is much longer than that of the Ni-Fe-based superalloy GH2984. The results suggest that this new alloy is a promising material for advanced ultra-supercritical power plant applications beyond 700 degrees C.

SO POWDER TECHNOLOGY
AB To further improve the cost-benefit of MCrAlX (X is a reactive element like Y, Hf, Ta, etc.) alloys, the microhardness, microstructure and oxidation behavior of two Ni-based alloys, Ni60Co30Al10 and Ni60Co10Cr20Al10 without reactive elements were studied by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and microhardness Vickers. These alloys were synthesized by mechanical alloying in a high energy ball mill and conventional sintering at 1100 degrees C under inert atmosphere. Milling time and Cr additions have a significant effect on microhardness of as-milled and sintered samples. Bulk samples were oxidized at 1000 degrees C for different times to analyze the possible growth of protective oxide scale, as well as the effect of Cr addition on the chemical composition of the oxide scale. After 3 h of oxidation the formation of Al2O3 oxide scale in the Ni60Co30Al10 alloy is evident. By reducing the Co content and incorporating 20 wt% of Cr, the formation of an Al2O3 oxide scale with the presence of Cr2O3 was observed. Even the formation of homogeneous, continuous and protective oxide products in the surface of samples is evident, the rnicrostructural changes after oxidation treatments have a significant effect on the decrease in microhardness of both alloys.

TI Isothermal aging of a gamma '-strengthened Co-Al-W alloy coated with
   vacuum plasma-sprayed MCrAlY bond coats
SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB Cobalt-based superalloys with a gamma/gamma' microstructure were discovered in 2006 and are currently being investigated as an alternative to nickel-based superalloys for high-temperature, high-load applications in gas turbine blades. They promise a better castability combined with a similar creep strength. Superalloy turbine blades are commonly coated with oxidation resistant bond coats. For this reason their compatibility needs to be studied. Co-9Al-9W specimens with a gamma/gamma' microstructure were coated with either a nickel-based or cobalt-based MCrAlY bond coat using vacuum plasma spraying. After aging at 900 degrees C in air for up to 500 h no decomposition of the gamma' phase was found in the bulk superalloy. The interdiffusion zone shows several different W-rich topologically close-packed phases arising from the dissolution of the gamma' phase in this region. The W-rich phases are identified to be mu phase for both bond coats and R phase for the nickel-based bond coat only. Their total volume is higher for the nickel-based bond coat. Therefore the cobalt-based bond coat is better suited for the Co-based superalloy substrate. Room temperature hardness and Young's modulus were measured using nanoindentation in the initial state and after heat treatment. A significantly higher Young's modulus was found for the cobalt-based bond coat (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Regulating the coarsening of the gamma ' phase in superalloys
SO NPG ASIA MATERIALS
AB The properties of superalloys are typically deteriorated by the coarsening of the nano-sized gamma' phase, which is the primary strengthening component at high temperatures. Stabilizing the gamma' phase represents one of the key challenges in developing next-generation superalloys. Herein, we fabricate a cobalt-nickel-based superalloy with a nanoscale coherent gamma' phase, (Ni,Co)(3) (Al, Ti, Nb), which is isolated by stacking-fault ribbons in the alloy matrix as a result of the Suzuki segregation of alloying atoms. Additionally, we demonstrate that this new nanostructure can slow down the coarsening of the gamma' phase at high temperatures. As a result, the cobalt-nickel-based superalloy displays considerably high tensile yield points, exceeding 1650 MPa at room temperature and 1250 MPa at 973 K, which are markedly higher than those of the commonly used nickel-and cobalt-based superalloys. This study thereby paves a new path for developing superalloys with exceptional mechanical performance and thermal stability.

TI Interfacial reactions of a MAX phase/superalloy hybrid
SO SURFACE AND INTERFACE ANALYSIS
AB Oxidation resistant, strain tolerant MAX phase coatings are of general interest for high temperature applications. Accordingly, Cr2AlC MAX phase coupons were vacuum diffusion bonded to an advanced turbine disk alloy at 1100 degrees C for compatibility studies. The interface revealed an inner diffusion zone consisting of similar to 10 mu m of -Ni(Co)Al, decorated with various (Ni,Co)(3)Al, Ta(Ti,Nb)C, and W(Cr,Mo)(3)B-2 precipitates. On the Cr2AlC side, an additional similar to 40-mu m Al-depletion zone of Cr7C3 formed an interconnected network with the -Ni(Co)Al. On the superalloy side, enhanced carbide precipitation developed over a depth of similar to 80 mu m. Subsequent annealing for 100h and 1000h at 800 degrees C coarsened some features, enhanced TCP precipitation in the superalloy, but only enlarged the diffusion layers by similar to 5 mu m at most. Because of Al depletion from the MAX phase and corresponding Al enrichment of the alloy, the reaction zone displayed similarities to an oxidized Cr2AlC surface and an aluminized superalloy, respectively.

TI Isothermal oxidation and hot corrosion behaviors of diffusion aluminide
   coatings deposited by chemical vapor deposition
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Aluminization has been employed on superalloys to form dense and adhesive alumina surface layers to prolong their service life at high temperature. A chemical vapor deposited aluminizing process had been employed to deposit nickel aluminide coatings on the nickel-based single-crystal superalloys. The kinetics behavior, phase evaluation, microstructure and chemical composition of the aluminide coatings after oxidation and hot corrosion tests were studied in detail. After isothermal oxidation test, a dense and protective alpha-Al2O3 surface layer is formed on the aluminized superalloy and phase transformation reactions occur in the aluminide layer and interdiffusion zone. The inward diffusion of Al element toward the substrate and formation of micro-pores in the interdiffusion zone are probably the main degradation modes of the aluminide coating. Corrosive medium including of mixed of aviation fuels and artificial seawater has not serious deterioration of aluminide coating after hot corrosion at 1123 K, although large of micro-pores and few of microcracks are observed within the aluminide layer, and the typical morphology of the aluminide layer becomes corse and disorder to a certain extent.

SO MODELLING AND SIMULATION IN MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
AB Interatomic potentials for the Ni-Co binary and Ni-Al-Co ternary systems have been developed on the basis of the second nearest-neighbor modified embedded-atom method (2NN MEAM) formalism. The potentials describe structural, thermodynamic, deformation and defect properties of solid solution phases or compound phases in reasonable agreements with experiments or first-principles calculations. The results demonstrate the transferability of the potentials and their applicability to large-scale atomistic simulations to investigate the effect of an alloying element, cobalt, on various microstructural factors related to mechanical properties of Ni-based superalloys on an atomic scale.

TI Dendrite Segregation in Ni3Al-Based Intermetallic Single Crystals
   Alloyed with Cr, Mo, W, Ti, Co, and Re
SO RUSSIAN METALLURGY
AB The character of dendrite segregation in Ni3Al-based intermetallic VKNA-type alloy single crystals with a dendritic-cellular structure is studied. Distribution coefficient k(d) of an alloying element (AE) in the alloy during solidification k(d) = c(d.a.I)/c(0) (c(0) is the AE content in the alloy (liquid phase composition), c(d.a.I) is the AE content in primary dendrite arms of the alloy (in the solid phase)) and segregation coefficient k(s) = c(d.a.I)/c(i.d) (c(i.d) is the AE content in the interdendritic space) have been found. A comparative study of the dendrite segregation parameters in VKNA-nype Ni3Al-based intermetallic alloys and the well-known ZhS36type nickel superalloy shows that the intermetallic alloys satisfy to the rule deduced for two- and three-component nickel-based superalloys: if an introduced AE increases the melting temperature of the basic metal, we have k(d) > 1 (Co, W, Re); if it decreases the melting temperature, we have k(d) < 1 (Al, Ti, Cr, Mo). Dendrite segregation coefficients k(s) are dependent on the proportion of the AE contents in the alloys. In nickel superalloys, the dendrite segregation of aluminum, tungsten, and rhenium is higher than that in the intermetallic alloys. The dendrite segregation coefficients of tungsten and rhenium is higher by a factor of 1.5-2 than that in the VKNA-type intermetallic alloys with a low content of refractory metals. This can be due to the retardation of diffusion of refractory metals in the solid phase of a nickel superalloy highly alloyed with these elements.

TI Effect of Ta additions on microstructure and mechanical properties of a
   single-crystal Co-Al-W-base alloy
SO MATERIALS LETTERS
AB Microstructures and mechanical properties of Co-9.5Al-5W-16Ni-6Cr-xTa (at% where x=0, 1.8, 2.8, named as 0Ta, 1.8Ta and 2.8Ta) alloys are investigated. Microstructures of heat-treated samples are composed of gamma and cubical gamma' precipitates. The gamma' solvus temperature increases obviously with Ta additions. The yield strength as well as creep strength is improved with the addition of Ta. Ta additions affect the high-temperature tensile deformation mechanism. The gamma' phase of the three alloys is rafted along the tensile axis direction during creep tests at 900 degrees C. The creep strength of 2.8Ta alloy is approaching the level of a first-generation Ni-base single-crystal superalloy. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI The Thermal Stability of Intermetallic Compounds in an As-Cast SX
   Co-Base Superalloy
SO ADVANCED ENGINEERING MATERIALS
AB The nature and stability of intermetallic phases in a multi-component / Co-base superalloy is investigated. At least three kinds of unwanted intermetallic phases form due to the segregation of Al, Ta, Ti, Si, and Hf during casting in the interdendritic areas in addition to and . One of the intermetallic phases that shows a blocky shape, contains high content of Ta, Hf, and Ti and has been identified as a topologically close-packed Laves phase. A B2 phase appears as relatively big pools and in some cases contains needle-shaped precipitates with high content of Al and Ti. The thermal stability of these intermetallic phases is studied in this work under defined heat treatments. The needle-shaped precipitates already dissolve at 1000 degrees C, whereas the B2 phase is dissolved only at higher temperatures of 1200 degrees C. Small amounts of Laves phases remained stable during aging at 1200 degrees C for 25h. The prediction of phases as well as their stability is also checked by the CALPHAD method. The TCNi5 database, containing the description of Co-3(Al,W), predicts the presence of the observed intermetallic phases; however, the predicted main transformation temperatures for these phases differ from the experimentally obtained values.

TI Influence of orientation-dependent grain boundary oxidation on fatigue
   cracking behaviour in an advanced Ni-based superalloy
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Fatigue tests have been conducted on an advanced disc Ni-based superalloy [low solvus, high refractory (LSHR) alloy] at 650 degrees C in air under three-point bend loading to investigate the role of orientation-dependent grain boundary (GB) oxidation in crack initiation and early propagation. It is found that crack initiation occurs mainly from bulged GB oxides, and cracks then predominantly propagate along the oxidised grain boundaries. These bulged oxides are extremely enriched in Co and preferentially form at the boundaries between high and low Schmid factor grains which are inclined normal to the applied tensile stress direction. Meanwhile, relatively flat/thin Ni/Ti/Al-rich oxide complexes also form at other grain boundaries, but they appear to be much less detrimental in fatigue crack initiation and propagation compared with the bulged GB Co-rich oxide complexes.

AB The microstructural evolution of Ni-20 pct Cr wires was studied during pack cementation where Al and Ti, with and without prior cementation with Mo, are deposited to the surface of the Ni-Cr wires and subsequently homogenized in their volumes. Mo deposition promotes the formation of Kirkendall pores and subsequent co-deposition of Al and Ti creates a triple-layered diffusional coating on the wire surface. Subsequent homogenization drives the alloying element to distribute evenly in the wires which upon further heat treatment exhibit the gamma + gamma' superalloy structure. Unexpectedly, formation of cellular structures is observed at some of the boundaries between primary gamma' grains and gamma matrix grains. Based on additional features (i.e., ordered but not perfectly periodic structure, confinement at gamma + gamma' phase boundaries as a cellular film with 100 nm width, as well as lack of topologically close-packed phases), and considering that similar, but much larger, microstructures were reported in commercial superalloys, it is concluded that the present cellular structure solidified as a thin film, composed of eutectic gamma + gamma' and from which the gamma' phase was subsequently etched, which was created by incipient melting of a region near the phase boundary with high solute segregation.

   Structure and Their Performance in Thermal Barrier Coatings Deposited on
   a Nickel-Based Superalloy
SO OXIDATION OF METALS
AB Three bond coats based on the gamma'-Ni3Al + gamma-Ni microstructure were developed by diffusing pairs of Pt layers and metallic layers with selected compositions into a Ni-based superalloy. Thermal exposure tests at 1,150 A degrees C with 24-h cycling period to room temperature were used to evaluate the thermal stability and oxidation behavior of the bond coats as well as their performance in thermal barrier coating systems utilizing zirconia-7 wt% yttria as the top coat. It is shown that a bond coat developed by a Pt layer and a layer of Ni-6 wt% Re-0.5 wt% Y alloy outperforms the conventional gamma' + gamma Pt bond coats by more than two folds. Most evidence points out that the proper concentrations of Re and Y in the presence of balanced concentrations of other elements, particularly Al, Ti, Cr and Co can significantly enhance the thermal stability and oxidation resistance of gamma' + gamma Pt bond coats.

TI Effects of deposition temperature on the kinetics growth and protective
   properties of aluminide coatings
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Chemical vapor aluminizing is a major production technique used for producing aluminide coatings on gas turbine blades to form dense and adhesive alumina surface layers and further prolong their service lives at high temperature. A chemical vapor deposited aluminizing process had been employed to deposit nickel aluminide coatings under the different deposition temperature. The phase structure, morphology, chemical composition, kinetics growth mechanism and oxidation/corrosion behavior of the aluminide coatings were studied in detail. The results show that the phase structure, microstructure and composition of the aluminide coatings are strongly influenced by the deposition temperature during chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The higher is the deposition temperature, the easier is the formation of pure beta-NiAl phase. Along with the increment of the deposition temperature, the coatings' surface will become smooth and dense, while the ridges along grain boundaries can be simultaneously approach to flat in a certain extend. Large numbers of elements of Cr, Mo and W within diffusion zone that could probably form a thin film layer, which is usually so-called as diffusion barrier. The key step of growth of coating grain is the formation of a volatile aluminium subhalide by controlling of the suitable deposition temperature during CVD. Based on the results of isothermal oxidation and hot corrosion kinetics curves, the best deposition parameter can be gained among the four coatings when the deposition temperature is adopted to be 1323 K.

AB The creep deformation behavior of a single-crystal Co-Al-W-Ni-Cr-Ta alloy with low tungsten content has been studied at stresses between 275 and 310 MPa at 900 degrees C. The alloy exhibits comparable creep strength with that of Co-Al-W-base alloys containing more tungsten. The creep deformation consists of three stages, the primary stage, the steady-state stage and the tertiary stage, when described by the creep strain rate versus time curve. At 900 degrees C, gamma' precipitates tend to raft along the direction of applied tensile stress in the steady-state creep stage and a topologically inverted and rafting gamma/gamma' microstructure is formed in the tertiary stage. The main deformation mechanism in the primary creep stage is dislocation shearing of gamma' precipitates, and in the following creep stages, the dominant deformation mechanism is dislocations bypassing gamma' precipitates.

SO HIGH TEMPERATURE MATERIALS AND PROCESSES
AB In this study, Al-Co-Ni ternary alloys were synthesized, in order to obtain low-cost starting material for Ni-based superalloy production, by a self-propagating high temperature synthesis (SHS) both under normal gravity conditions (a = 9.81 m/s(2)) and under high gravity conditions (up to 1000 g-force) by using a centrifugal machine. The mixture of Co3O4-NiO powder were reduced by Al powder for the production of SHS alloys with the estimated compositions of 5-10 mass% Al, 20-65 mass% Co, 25-75 mass% Ni. The effect of green mixture compositions and centrifugal overload on combustion temperature, alloy/slag separations, chemical composition and microstructure of final alloys were investigated. The chemical analysis results showed that production of SHS alloys were achieved by having up to 86.12% of Co and 92.32% of Ni recoveries. The highest metal recovery value was obtained in SHS alloy with the estimated composition of 10%Al-65%Co-25% Ni by the addition of 20% Al2O3 into the green mixture. The metal/slag separation efficiency increased by increasing the centrifugal overload.

TI EFFECT OF NOTCH ORIENTATION AND LOCAL RECRYSTALLIZATION ON THERMAL
   FATIGUE PROPERTIES OF A DIRECTIONALLY SOLIDIFIED Co-BASED SUPERALLOY
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB The directionally solidificated (DS) Co-based superalloys are widely used in aircraft turbine vanes due to the good stress-rupture parameters and excellent hot corrosion resistance. The cyclic change of temperatures and complex stress state thermal fatigue (TF) cracks happen frequently in vanes during service. However, most of the work are conducted in Ni-based superalloys and there is rare report concerning the TF behavior of DS Co-based superalloys. Furthermore, due to the residual strain accumulated during processing, shot peening, grinding and recrystallization (RX) frequently occur when the DS components are exposed to high temperatures. It is believed that RX may change the microstructure, especially adding more grain boundaries to DS alloys, and result in the reduction of the mechanical properties of DS superalloys. Therefore, in this work, V-notch plate specimens with notch direction perpendicular and parallel to the DS orientation are machined from the DS plate. Local RX grains are prepared (local indented and then heat treated) in the notch areas of some samples. TF test is conducted between 1000 degrees C to room temperature. The effect of DS orientation and RX on TF properties of a DS Co-based superalloy is investigated. The results indicate that the cracks propagate along the interdendritic regions in the samples with notches parallel to the DS direction, which exhibites lower TF properties than samples with notches vertical to the DS direction. TF cracks initiate and propagate along RX boundaries in samples containing RX grains. Precipitation of M23C6 carbides is found along the RX boundaries during TF tests. Due to the oxidation at the tip of crack, M23C6 desquamates and leads to the formation of micro voids, which accelerates the crack propagation and decreases TF properties of tested alloy. In samples with notches parallel to the DS direction, cracks preferentially propagate along the RX grain boundaries.

TI Microstructure-Mechanical Properties Relation of TLP-Bonded FSX-414
   Superalloy: Effect of Homogenization Design
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING AND PERFORMANCE
AB Co-based FSX-414 superalloy is especially used for first-stage nozzles of gas turbines. Transient liquid phase (TLP) bonding has potential as repair process for these nozzles. In this study, homogenization of TLP-bonded FSX-414 superalloy at optimum bonding condition (1150 A degrees C/5 min) was conducted at 1175, 1200, and 1225 A degrees C for 1, 3, and 6 h. Homogenization at 1175 A degrees C/1 h had no effect on removing the diffusion-affected zone (DAZ) phases. Increasing the time to 6 h was effective in removing DAZ phases and boride phases formed due to liquefaction, but compositional homogenization was not complete. Homogenization at 1200 A degrees C for 1 h caused boride phases to form adjacent to the joint and in the base metal. By increasing the time to 3 h produced joint, free of these phases. At 1225 A degrees C/3 h homogenization condition, using a Ni-etchant and EDS analysis across the joint showed appropriate combination of compositional and microstructural homogenization including removed DAZ phases. The highest hardness, the most uniform hardness profile across the joint, and the highest shear strength (91% of the base metal strength) in addition to the microstructural features showed the best joints homogenizing at 1225 A degrees C for 3 h.

TI Evolution of microstructure and mechanical properties of coated Co-base
   superalloys during heat treatment and thermal exposure
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB New gamma'-strengthened Co-base superalloys show an interesting potential for high temperature applications. However, protective coatings are needed as for Ni-base superalloys to ensure sufficient oxidation and corrosion resistance. Therefore the properties of a commercial coating on a multinary new gamma'-strengthened Co-base superalloy have been studied. Especially the influence of the coating process on the substrate also after long term annealing is discussed. It was found that the highly deformed areas at the coating-substrate interface indicated by a high local misorientation and caused by the sandblasting process led to a recrystallization of the interdiffusion zone during the age hardening heat treatment. A chemical gradient of gamma and gamma' promoting elements was found in the interdiffusion zone causing a change in hardness as measured by nanoindentation. Depending on the composition two separate recrystallized regions formed in the interdiffusion zone, one with single phase gamma-(Co,Ni) and the other with a cellular two phase microstructure of discontinuously grown gamma and gamma'.

TI A new tungsten-free gamma-gamma ' Co-Al-Mo-Nb-based superalloy
SO SCRIPTA MATERIALIA
AB We present the first report of a tungsten-free cobalt-based superalloy having a composition Co-10Al-5Mo-2Nb. The alloy is strengthened by cuboidal precipitates of metastable Co-3(Al,Mo,Nb) distributed throughout the microstructure. The precipitates are coherent with the face-centred cubic gamma-Co matrix and possess ordered Ll(2) structure. The microstructure is identical to the popular gamma-gamma' type nickel-based superalloys and that of recently reported Co-Al-W-based alloys. Being tungsten free, the reported alloy has higher specific proof stress compared to existing cobalt-based superalloys. (C) 2014 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Synthesis of a new tungsten-free gamma-gamma ' cobalt-based superalloy
   by tuning alloying additions
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB The paper presents the synthesis of a new class of gamma-gamma' cobalt-based superalloy that is free of tungsten as an alloying addition. It has much lower density and higher specific strength than the existing cobalt-based superalloys. The current superalloys have a base composition of Co-10Al and are further tuned by the addition of a binary combination of molybdenum and niobium, with the optimum composition of Co-10Al-5Mo-2Nb. The solvus temperature of the alloy (866 degrees C) can be further enhanced above 950 C by the addition of Ni to give the form Co-xNi-10Al-5Mo-2Nb, where x can be from 0 to 30 at.%. After heat treatment, these alloys exhibit a duplex microstructure with coherent cuboidal L1(2)-ordered precipitates (gamma') throughout the face-centred cubic matrix (gamma), yielding a microstructure that is very similar to nickel-based superalloys as well as recently developed Co-Al-W-based alloys. We show that the stability of the gamma' phase improves significantly with the nickel addition, which can be attributed to the increase in solvus temperature. A very high specific 0.2% proof stress of 94.3 MPa g(-1) cm(-3) at room temperature and 63.8 MPa g(-1) cm(-3) at 870 degrees C were obtained for alloy Co-30Ni-10Al-5Mo-2Nb. The remarkably high specific strength of these alloys makes this class of alloy a promising material for use at high temperature, including gas turbine applications. (C) 2014 Acta Materialia Inc.

TI Compositional variations for small-scale gamma prime (gamma ')
   precipitates formed at different cooling rates in an advanced Ni-based
   superalloy
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB Size-dependent compositional variations under different cooling regimes have been investigated for ordered L1(2)-structured gamma prime (gamma') precipitates in the commercial powder metallurgy Ni-based superalloy RR1000. Using scanning transmission electron microscope imaging combined with absorption-corrected energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, we have discovered large differences in the Al, Ti and Co compositions for gamma' precipitates in the size range 10-300 nm. Our experimental results, coupled with complementary thermodynamic calculations, demonstrate the importance of kinetic factors on precipitate composition in Ni-based superalloys. In particular, these results provide new evidence for the role of elemental diffusion kinetics and aluminium antisite atoms on the low-temperature growth kinetics of fine-scale gamma' precipitates. Our findings have important implications for understanding the microstructure and precipitation behaviour of Ni-based superalloys, suggesting a transition in the mechanism of vacancy-mediated diffusion of Al from intrasublattice exchange at high temperatures to intersublattice antisite-assisted exchange at low temperatures.

TI Microstructural characterization of a new mechanically alloyed Ni-base
   ODS superalloy powder
SO MATERIALS CHARACTERIZATION
AB The microstructure of a new Ni-base oxide dispersion strengthened superalloy powder was studied for high temperature gas turbine.applications after the mechanical alloying process. In this study, an atomized powder with a composition similar to the CMSX-10 superalloy was mechanically alloyed with yttria and Hf powders. The mechanically alloyed powder included only the supersaturated solid solution gamma phase without gamma' and yttria provided by severe plastic deformation, while after the 3-step aging, the gamma' phase was precipitated due to the partitioning of Al and Ta to the gamma' and Co, Cr, Re, W, and Mo to the gamma phase. Mechanical alloying modified the morphology of gamma' to the new coherent gamma-gamma' nanoscale lamellar structure to minimize the elastic strain energy of the precipitation, which yielded a low lattice misfit of 0.16% at high temperature. The gamma' lamellae aligned preferentially along the elastically soft [100] direction. Also, the precipitated oxide particles were refined in the gamma phase by adding Hf from large incoherent YAlO3 to fine semi-coherent Y2Hf2O7 oxide particles with the average size of 7 nm and low interparticle spacing of 76 nm.

TI Aging behavior and microstructure evolution of a cold-drawn Ni-Co
   superalloy
SO SCIENTIA IRANICA
AB Age hardening behavior and microstructure of superalloy AEREX 350 (TM) in commercially cold-drawn condition were studied. It was found that aging the cold drawn alloy significantly facilitated the formation of major phases of gamma prime and eta, in AEREX 350 (TM). Interestingly, the minimum temperature of formation of gamma prime and eta phases in the cold drawn alloy was lower by about 30 degrees C and 5 degrees C, respectively, to that previously reported for the solution treated alloy. Cold working, however, did not considerably influence the maximum temperature of stability of these phases. In addition, Widmanstatten morphology of eta phase significantly improved in the cold drawn samples compared to that seen in the solution treated alloy. Diffusion through dislocation network could have facilitated growth of major phases whereas its influence on dissolution temperature of these phases was negligible. In addition, it was suggested that cold working might increase the density of hcp nuclei in the fcc matrix. This may justify the observed enhancement of the Widmanstatten morphology of eta phase in these samples following the aging process. (C) 2015 Sharif University of Technology. All rights reserved.

TI Advanced Scale Bridging Microstructure Analysis of Single Crystal
   Ni-Base Superalloys
SO ADVANCED ENGINEERING MATERIALS
AB In the present work, we show how conventional and advanced mechanical, chemical, and microstructural methods can be used to characterize cast single crystal Ni-base superalloy (SX) plates across multiple length scales. Two types of microstructural heterogeneities are important, associated with the castmicrostructure (dendrites (D) and interdendritic (ID) regions - large scale heterogeneity) and with the well-known gamma/gamma' microstructure (small scale heterogeneity). Using electron probe microanalysis (EPMA), we can show that elements such as Re, Co, and Cr partition to the dendrites while ID regions contain more Al, Ta, and Ti. Analytical transmission electron microscopy and atom probe tomography (APT) show that Al, Ta, and Ti partition to the gamma' cubes while gamma channels show higher concentrations of Co, Cr, Re, and W. We can combine large scale (EPMA) and small-scale analytical methods (APT) to obtain reasonable estimates for gamma' volume fractions in the dendrites and in the ID regions. The chemical and mechanical properties of the SX plates studied in the present work are homogeneous, when they are determined from gamma' volumes with dimensions, which are significantly larger than the dendrite spacing. For the SX plates (140 mm x 100 mm x 20 mm) studied in the present work this holds for the average chemical composition as well as for elastic behavior and local creep properties. We highlight the potential of HRTEM and APT to contribute to a better understanding of the role of dislocations during coarsening of the gamma' phase and the effect of cooling rates after high temperature exposure on the microstructure.

TI Berkovich nanoindentation and deformation mechanisms in a hardmetal
   binder-like cobalt alloy
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB A cobalt-base solid solution is the most used binder for hardmetals (WC-Co cemented carbides) in a wide range of industrial applications. In the composite material such cobalt alloy is surrounded by hard carbides grains; thus, a direct evaluation of its intrinsic mechanical properties is not an easy task. In order to overcome this inconvenience, a model cobalt alloy with a composition similar to that exhibited by typical hardmetal binder (containing W and C in solid solution) was processed following a powder metallurgy route. Nanoindentation testing at different length scales has been performed to study the mechanical properties as well as to introduce plastic deformation in individual grains of the dilute face centered cubic (fcc) stabilized model Co-W-C alloy. It is found that it exhibits an isotropic mechanical response, without any evidence of indentation size effects. The main deformation mechanism activated during the indentation tests resulted to be deformation twinning, although combined with limited planar slip but with no evidence of stress-induced phase transformation. Such finding is related to the high W and C amounts dissolved in the model Co alloy studied, and its effect on stabilizing the fcc configuration and increasing the stacking fault energy. The effective use of small-length scale mechanical characterization protocols is finally discussed for understanding deformation response of binder-like alloys and optimizing microstructural design of hardmetals.

TI Temperature dependence of deformation behavior in a Co-Al-W-base single
   crystal superalloy
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB Tensile properties of a single-crystal Co-Al-W-Ni-Cr-Ta alloy with low tungsten content have been studied within the temperatures ranging from 20 to 1000 degrees C at a constant strain rate of 1.0 x 10(-4) s(-1). The alloy exhibits comparable yield strength with that of Co-Al-W-base alloys containing more tungsten. From 600 degrees C to 800 degrees C, a yield strength anomaly is observed, probably due to the cross-slip of superdislocations from the octahedral plane to the cube plane. TEM analysis demonstrates that stacking faults (SFs) appear both in gamma channels and gamma' precipitates in a wide temperature range. These SFs are responsible for the obvious strain hardening observed in stress-strain curves. From room temperature to 900 degrees C, the deformation is dominated by dislocations shearing gamma' particles. At 1000 degrees C, the main deformation mechanism is dislocations bypassing gamma' particles. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In order to make clear the mechanism of the directional coarsening (rafting) of gamma' phases in Ni-base superalloys under uni-axial tensile strain, molecular dynamics (MD) analysis Was applied to investigate dominant factors of strain-induced anisotropic diffusion of Al atoms and nanotexture change of fine dispersed gamma' precipitates. In this study, a simple interface structure model corresponding to the gamma/gamma' interface, which consisted of Ni as gamma and Ni3Al as gamma' structure, was used to analyze the effect of alloying element on diffusion properties. The diffusion constants of Al atoms were changed drastically by the dopant elements and their contents. When the lattice constant of the gamma phase was increased and its melting point was decreased by the addition of Cr or Al atoms, the strain-induced anisotropic diffusion of Al atoms in the gamma' phase was accelerated. On the other hand, the addition of Co decreased the diffusion significantly. Therefore, changes of lattice constant and melting point depending on the chemical composition of the gamma/gamma' interface are the dominant factors controlling the strain-induced anisotropic diffusion of Al atoms in the Ni-base superalloy.

SO LASERS IN ENGINEERING
AB The laser-aided direct metal deposition (DMD) technique was used to form Co-285 + WC and Co-285+WC+Y coatings on 1018 mild steel. Microstructure, element distribution, phases, micro-hardness distribution and wear properties of the two coatings were investigated. Comparison indicates that both coatings were dense, and inhomogeneous with undissolved WC particles distributed in the Co-rich matrix. Microstructure around undissolved WC particles in Co-285 + WC coating exhibited gradient distribution, while that in Co-285+WC+Y coating has uniform distribution. Due to the addition of yttrium, no cracks were found in the latter coating while there were some micro-cracks in the former coating. Also, Co6W6C new phase and Cr7C3 instead of Cr3C2 were formed in Co285+WC+Y coating. The average micro-hardness of the matrix in Co-285 + WC coating was 751 HV0.5, which was almost 1.2 times that of Co-285+WC+Y coating (632 HV0.5). Wear results at ambient room temperature indicated that wear resistance of the two coatings was almost the same (Co-285+WC+Y coating was 1.06 times that of Co-285+WC coating) after 420 m (60 minutes) sliding wear test. Addition of yttrium did not change the wear mechanism. Effects of yttrium on the microstructure, phases and wear resistance were discussed.

TI A new computational approach for modelling the microstructural evolution
   and residual lifetime assessment of MCrAlY coatings
SO MATERIALS AT HIGH TEMPERATURES
AB MCrAlY (M=Ni, Co) coatings are commonly used to protect the underlying superalloy component in industrial gas turbines and aeroengines from oxidation attack. They also function as bond coats for thermal barrier coatings (TBC). The chemical life time of the coated component is mainly governed by the depletion of the beta-phase in the bond coat as a result of simultaneously occurring surface oxidation and interdiffusion between the coating and the substrate. A new computational approach to model the microstructural evolution in MCrAlY (M=Ni, Co) coatings on Ni base superalloys was undertaken in the present study. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and wavelength dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (WDX) was employed to characterise MCrAlY coated superalloy samples after exposure at 1000 and 1100 degrees C. Phases were identified by electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and correlated with SEM/EDX/WDX analyses.
   Modelling of the microstructural evolution was carried out considering simultaneously occurring surface oxidation and interdiffusion processes. A flux based calculation of the concentration profiles and stable phases was performed, taking into account diffusion of all elements in the gamma, gamma ' and beta-NiAl phases. Good agreement was found between the observed and computed phase distributions after specific time intervals. The computed widths of the beta-depletion zones showed satisfactory agreement with the measurements. Additionally, the model was able to predict the formation of a TCP-phase and its penetration into the substrate with increasing exposure time in one of the investigated coating systems.

AB There are over 1000 biomass boilers and about 500 plants using waste as fuel in Europe, and the numbers are increasing. Many of them encounter serious problems with high-temperature corrosion due to detrimental elements such as chlorides, alkali metals, and heavy metals. By HVOF spraying, it is possible to produce very dense and well-adhered coatings, which can be applied for corrosion protection of heat exchanger surfaces in biomass and waste-to-energy power plant boilers. Four HVOF coatings and one arc sprayed coating were exposed to actual biomass co-fired boiler conditions in superheater area with a probe measurement installation for 5900 h at 550 and 750 degrees C. The coating materials were Ni-Cr, IN625, Fe-Cr-W-Nb-Mo, and Ni-Cr-Ti. CJS and DJ Hybrid spray guns were used for HVOF spraying to compare the corrosion resistance of Ni-Cr coating structures. Reference materials were ferritic steel T92 and nickel super alloy A263. The circulating fluidized bed boiler burnt a mixture of wood, peat and coal. The coatings showed excellent corrosion resistance at 550 degrees C compared to the ferritic steel. At higher temperature, NiCr sprayed with CJS had the best corrosion resistance. IN625 was consumed almost completely during the exposure at 750 degrees C.

TI Mechanics and mechanisms of fatigue in a WC-Ni hardmetal and a
   comparative study with respect to WC-Co hardmetals
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FATIGUE
AB There is a major interest in replacing cobalt binder in hardmetals (cemented carbides) aiming for materials with similar or even improved properties at a lower price. Nickel is one of the materials most commonly used as a binder alternative to cobalt in these metal-ceramic composites. However, knowledge on mechanical properties and particularly on fatigue behavior of Ni-base cemented carbides is relatively scarce. In this study, the fatigue mechanics and mechanisms of a fine grained WC-Ni grade is assessed. In doing so, fatigue crack growth (FCG) behavior and fatigue limit are determined, and the attained results are compared to corresponding fracture toughness and flexural strength. An analysis of the results within a fatigue mechanics framework permits to validate FCG threshold as the effective fracture toughness under cyclic loading. Experimentally determined data are then used to analyze the fatigue susceptibility of the studied material. It is found that the fatigue sensitivity of the WC-Ni hardmetal investigated is close to that previously reported for Co-base cemented carbides with alike binder mean free path. Additionally, fracture modes under stable and unstable crack growth conditions are inspected. It is evidenced that stable crack growth under cyclic loading within the nickel binder exhibit faceted, crystallographic features. This microscopic failure mode is rationalized on the basis of the comparable sizes of the cyclic plastic zone ahead of the crack tip and the characteristic microstructure length scale where fatigue degradation phenomena take place in hardmetals, i.e. the binder mean free path.

TI A ternary Ni-Al-W EAM potential for Ni-based single crystal superalloys
SO PHYSICA B-CONDENSED MATTER
AB Based on experiments and first-principles calculations, a ternary Ni-Al-W embedded-atom-method (EAM) potential is constructed for the Ni-based single crystal superalloys. The potential predicts that W atoms do not tend to form clusters in gamma(Ni), which is consistent with experiments. The impurity diffusion of W in gamma(Ni) is investigated using the five-frequency model. The diffusion coefficients and the diffusion activation energy of W are in reasonable agreement with the data in literatures. By W doping, the lattice misfit between the two phases decreases and the elastic constants of gamma'(Ni3Al) increase. As for alloyed elements Co, Re and W, the pinning effect of solute atom on the gamma(Ni)/gamma'(Ni3Al) misfit dislocation increases with the increasing of the atomic radius. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

   superalloys. Part I. Characterization and comparison of isothermal
   oxidation behavior at 1100 degrees C with a NiCrAlY coating
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB A microcrystalline beta-NiAl coating was prepared on a single-crystal (SC) superalloy substrate via magnetron sputtering and subsequent vacuum annealing. The grain sizes of the coating ranged from about 300 nm to 1 mu m. A reference NiCrAlY coating, which was mainly comprised of gamma'-Ni3Al and alpha-Cr, was prepared by means of vacuum arc evaporation (VAE). Isothermal oxidation tests were carried out at 1100 degrees C in air for 50 h. Both coatings formed thin and adherent alpha-Al2O3 scales during tests, while the oxide scales on the bare superalloy primarily consisted of spinel (Ni,Co)Al2O4 with underlying alpha-Al2O3 scale. The parabolic rate constant of the NiAl-coated specimens was about one order of magnitude lower than that of the NiCrAlY coated specimens. After oxidation tests, only a small amount of gamma' phase was detected at some columnar boundaries of the beta-NiAl coating, and about 2/3 parts of the NiCrAlY coating transformed into gamma phase which resolved the alpha-Cr precipitations, while an Al-depleted zone in thickness of about 10 mu m formed beneath the TGO of the bare superalloy. Inter-diffusion zones and secondary reaction zones were observed on the specimens coated by either beta-NiAl or NiCrAlY. The oxidation mechanism and microstructure evolvement of the specimens during high temperature exposures were discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI gamma' Phase Stability and Phase Equilibrium in Ternary Co-Al-W at 900 A
   degrees C
SO JOURNAL OF PHASE EQUILIBRIA AND DIFFUSION
AB Phase equilibria at 900 A degrees C in the Co-rich Co-Al-W ternary system are investigated through isothermal annealing of six alloy compositions for times up to 8000 h. The volume fraction of the L1(2)-gamma' phase co-existing with disordered FCC-gamma, B2 and D0(19) phases is found to steadily decrease with increasing annealing time indicating that it is unstable at 900 A degrees C. Additional heat treatments at 850 and 1000 A degrees C further suggest it is a nonequilibrium phase at all temperatures in the ternary system. The L1(2)-gamma' phase dissolves slowly with significant amounts remaining in some alloys after 8000 h at 900 A degrees C. However, the present work clearly indicates the microstructure is moving toward a three-phase equilibrium between gamma, D0(19), and B2. The collected compositional and phase equilibria information provide much needed data for improving the available thermodynamic assessments of the ternary Co-Al-W alloy system.

TI A New Polycrystalline Co-Ni Superalloy
SO JOM
AB In 2006, a new-ordered L1(2) phase, Co-3(Al,W), was discovered that can form coherently in a face-centered cubic (fcc) A1 Co matrix. Since then, a community has developed that is attempting to take these alloys forward into practical applications in gas turbines. A new candidate polycrystalline Co-Ni gamma/gamma' superalloy, V208C, is presented that has the nominal composition 36Co-35Ni-15Cr-10Al-3W-1Ta (at.%). The alloy was produced by conventional powder metallurgy superalloy methods. After forging, a gamma' fraction of similar to 56% and a secondary gamma' size of 88 nm were obtained, with a grain size of 2.5 mu m. The solvus temperature was 1000 degrees C. The density was found to be 8.52 g cm(-3), which is similar to existing Ni alloys with this level of gamma'. The alloy showed the flow stress anomaly and a yield strength of 920 MPa at room temperature and 820 MPa at 800 degrees C, similar to that of Mar-M247. These values are significantly higher than those found for either conventional solution and carbide-strengthened Co alloys or the gamma/gamma' Co superalloys presented in the literature thus far. The oxidation resistance, with a mass gain of 0.08 mg cm(-2) in 100 h at 800 degrees C, is also comparable with that of existing high-temperature Ni superalloys. These results suggest that Co-based and Co-Ni superalloys may hold some promise for the future in gas turbine applications.

TI Influence of elevated Co and Ti levels on polycrystalline powder
   processed Ni-base superalloy
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The influences of elevated Co and Ti levels on the mechanical properties of the Ni-base superalloy RR1000 have been investigated. Following heat treatment, the modified alloys had the typical gamma-gamma' microstructure, with gamma' precipitate sizes comparable to similarly heat treated RR1000, but with a slightly higher volume fraction. The modified alloys exhibited a higher proof stress than RR1000 across the entire 20 to 800 degrees C temperature range investigated. Superior creep rupture lives, when compared to RR1000, were observed in the modified alloys at 700 degrees C, but not at 750 degrees C, where extensive precipitation of topologically close packed sigma phase occurred on the grain surfaces. The formation of this deleterious phase was linked to Cr and Mo enrichment of the c matrix, caused by the elevated Co and Ti additions.

TI Temporal evolution of non-equilibrium gamma ' precipitates in a rapidly
   quenched nickel base superalloy
SO INTERMETALLICS
AB The temporal evolution of non-equilibrium gamma' precipitates in a rapidly quenched and isothermally annealed commercial nickel base superalloy has been investigated by coupling transmission electron microscopy and atom probe tomography. When subjected to rapid quenching from above the gamma' solvus temperature, the supersaturated single phase gamma matrix appears to undergo compositional phase separation possibly via spinodal decomposition to form solute-rich and solute-depleted regions. The regions that have a depletion in Cr and Co undergo an ordering process resulting in the gamma' domains which exhibit a far from equilibrium composition. Upon isothermal annealing, the gamma/gamma' interface sharpens and the compositions of both gamma and gamma' phases approach equilibrium. The influence of a non-classical mechanism of gamma' precipitation on the size distribution of precipitates as well as the precipitate and matrix compositions, and its subsequent evolution during isothermal annealing has been discussed.

TI INFLUENCE OF Ti/Al RATIOS ON gamma ' COARSENING BEHAVIOR AND TENSILE
   PROPERTIES OF GH984G ALLOY DURING LONG-TERM THERMAL EXPOSURE
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB GH984G is a new Ni-Fe-Cr base alloy which has been designed for use as superheater, reheater and header materials for boilers in 700 degrees C advanced ultra-supercritical (A-USC) coal-fired power plants. Compared with the CCA617, Nimonic 263 and IN 740 alloys, the GH984G is an economic alloy due to the elimination of Co and it containing more than 20%Fe. As a precipitation hardened alloy, the size of gamma' precipitates has great influence on the tensile properties. The y precipitates become coarse during long-term thermal exposure. The coarsening behavior of gamma' precipitates is closely related with Ti/Al ratio. However, there are few investigations about the influence of Ti/Al ratio on the coarsening behavior of y precipitates of GH984G alloy. Therefore, in this work, the coarsening behavior of gamma' precipitates and its influence on tensile properties of GH984G alloy with two Ti/Al ratios was investigated during long-term thermal exposure. The results show that the growth kinetic of the gamma' precipitates can be explained by Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner's theory of element diffusion controlled coarsening during long-term thermal exposure at 700 and 750 degrees C. The rate of gamma' precipitates growth of the alloy with high Ti/Al ratio is higher. At 800 degrees C, the rate of gamma' precipitates growth decreases with increasing the thermal exposure time. The coarsening behavior does not follow the Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner's theory. The reasons are attributed to the effect of elastic interaction energy and the depletion of gamma'-forming elements in y matrix. The Ti/Al ratio has no obvious influence on 700 degrees C tensile properties during long-term thermal exposure between 700 and 800 degrees C. The 700 degrees C yield strength has no obviously decreases even if after thermal exposure at 700 degrees C for 10480 h. The ductility increases after thermal exposure at 800 degrees C. The variation of strength and ductility is attributed to the coarsening of gamma' precipitation. The deformation mechanism is the moving dislocations shear gamma' precipitates and the stacking faults form in gamma' precipitates. The fracture mode is the mixture fracture mode. The Ti/Al ratio has no significance influence on the deformation mechanism and the fracture mode.

TI MCrAlY coating design based on oxidation-diffusion modelling. Part I:
   Microstructural evolution
SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB To improve the efficiency of modern gas turbines, it is highly desired to develop durable MCrAlY alloys, to be used as protective coatings against oxidation and corrosion for superalloys which are the base materials for some hot components like turbine blades and vanes. In this paper, an oxidation-diffusion model was used to simulate the diffusion of alloying elements and the corresponding microstructural changes in different superalloy-coating systems at high temperature. Two important processes are considered in this model: oxidation of the coating and interdiffusion between the superalloy and the coating. The model showed an accurate predictability of the diffusion and microstructural evolution in real superalloy-coating diffusion couples studied at high-temperature exposure. The model was further applied to investigate the elemental effects of Ni, Co, Cr and Al on the microstructural evolution, considering the development of two important phases in superalloys and coatings, i.e. FCC-gamma' and BCC-beta, at different temperatures. The results in this paper deepen the knowledge of the MCrAlY coating design for superalloy-coating systems in high-temperature applications. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Discontinuous Precipitation of gamma ' Phase in Ni-Co-Al Alloys
SO JOM
AB Decomposition of nickel-base alloys by precipitation of the gamma' phase occurs either continuously (homogeneously) or discontinuously. Under certain conditions of solute content and temperature, discontinuous precipitation is observed. Ni-Al-Co alloys have been characterized by coupling atom probe tomography with transmission electron microscopy studies. The primary focus was to investigate the discontinuous precipitation of gamma and gamma' phases. When subjected to fast quenching after solution treatment, the gamma' precipitates exhibit a near-spherical shape and monomodal size distribution with an average size of less than 5 nm. After early stage annealing at 600A degrees C for 10 min, discontinuous precipitation nucleated near the grain boundaries while some regions of homogeneous gamma' precipitates were observed. Discontinuous gamma + gamma' product was completely transformed throughout the grain after 600A degrees C/1 h. On long-term annealing (600A degrees C/256 h), coarser gamma + gamma' lamellae products replaced the fine discontinuous products that exhibited after 1 h annealing at 600A degrees C. Equilibrium compositions of the gamma and gamma' phases were achieved in this coarsening stage. The gamma' phase has an Al content of 25 at.%, which is consistent with the as-quenched condition where the (Ni + Co)(3)Al stoichiometry is maintained after 600A degrees C/256 h annealing.

TI Brazing of CMSX-4 with a Boron- and Silicon-Free Ni-Co-Zr-Hf-Cr-Ti-Al
   Brazing Alloy
SO WELDING JOURNAL
AB In this study, a new boron- and silicon-free brazing alloy containing Ni-Co-Zr-Hf-Cr-Ti-Al was used to join CMSX-4 under three conditions. The resultant joint interface microstructure and hardness of the constituents were evaluated and are reported here. It was found that by using a combination of Hf and Zr as a primary melting point depressant, the amount of each element could be effectively reduced while still achieving a relatively low liquidus for the brazing alloy. The new brazing alloy is able to successfully join CMSX-4 with complete metallic bonding. Although two types of interfacial Zr-rich intermetallic compounds were observed after a 40-mM brazing cycle, their hardness values are similar to that of a superalloy substrate. With the application of pressure during brazing or postbrazing homogenization heat treatment, the intermetallic compounds are substantially reduced. Furthermore, the formation of cellular gamma/gamma' in the interfacial region is discussed in this paper.

SO CORROSION SCIENCE
AB The isothermal and cyclic oxidation behaviour of two Co modified aluminide coatings together with the simple aluminide coating were performed at 1000 degrees C and 1100 degrees C. All the three coatings show a much lower oxidation rate compared with the bare alloy. Results also indicate the addition of Co to the aluminide coating decreases the oxidation resistance slightly. It can be ascribed to that Co is easier to be oxidized than Ni at high temperature, and the Cr(W) rich phases which could act as a diffusion barrier are less in the coating with higher Co content.

TI Evaluation of fracture toughness and impact toughness of laser rapid
   manufactured Inconel-625 structures and their co-relation
SO MATERIALS & DESIGN
AB The present study involves evaluation of fracture toughness and Charpy impact toughness of Inconel 625 structures fabricated by laser based additive manufacturing. The results of crack tip opening displacement (CTOD) fracture toughness are close to those reported for the Inconel 625 weld metal. The nature of the load-time traces of instrumented Charpy impact tests revealed that the alloy Inconel 625 in laser fabricated condition was associated with fully ductile behavior with Charpy V-Notch impact energy in the range of 48-54 J. Stress relieving heat treatment at 950 degrees C for 1 h has resulted in marginal improvement in the impact toughness by about 10%, whereas no clear evidence of such improvement is seen in the CTOD fracture toughness. Fractographic examination of the Charpy specimens and the results of the instrumented impact tests imply that the mechanism of crack growth was propagation controlled under dynamic loading conditions. Dynamic fracture parameters were estimated from the instrumented impact test data and compared with the experimentally evaluated fracture toughness results. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Microstructure formation in gamma-gamma ' Co-Al-W-Ti alloys during
   directional solidification
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB The microstructure formation process in Co-Al-W-Ti alloys was investigated through quenching performed during directional solidification. The phase transition route of the Co-Al-W-Ti alloys during directional solidification is determined as follows: L -> L + gamma -> L + gamma + (beta + gamma') -> L + gamma + gamma' + (beta + gamma') -> gamma + gamma' + beta + (beta + gamma'). The eutectic (beta + gamma'), primary gamma' and b are orderly deposited in terminal stages of solidification. The eutectic gamma' and beta are well distributed and nucleate in random directions. The gamma' particles are precipitated initially from the interdendritic Al-rich regions and subsequently from the dendritic region. The sizes of the gamma' particles close to the primary gamma' and beta phases are greater than that of the particles far from them. Since the growth of eutectic colonies restricts the interdendritic liquid convection at earlier stage of the terminal solidification, Co-Al-W-Ti alloys are resistant to the grain defect formation and suitable for fabricating single crystal components.

TI On deposition of Waspaloy coatings by cold spray
SO SURFACE ENGINEERING
AB The deposition of pore free and highly adhered Ni and Co superalloy coatings is of great interest for engine design and gas turbine applications, both in case of maintenance repair and overhaul operations as well for mechanical and chemical protection purposes in aeronautics and energy applications. This study would like to give a wide overview about the capability of cold spray technology on this topic: two different commercially available deposition systems, Sulzer-CGT Kinetiks 4000 and Plasma Giken PCS-1000, were compared, and deposition processes with both nitrogen and helium as carrier gas have been explored. Microstructural investigation, microhardness and adhesion results are reported to depict a preliminary scenario of coating properties. Fully dense coatings with thickness > 1 mm and adhesion > 50 MPa are obtained using helium, while quite porous, 20 MPa adhered coatings are obtained using nitrogen. Finally, general considerations about the potential applicability of those coatings for repair purpose in aerospace applications are pointed out.

TI Partitioning and site occupancy of Ta and Mo in Co-base gamma/gamma '
   alloys studied by atom probe tomography
SO INTERMETALLICS
AB The detailed understanding of solute partitioning and site occupancies of these solutes within the ordered gamma' (L1(2)) precipitates holds a key role in the development of cobalt-base gamma/gamma' alloys with optimized properties. The present atom probe tomography study utilizes both structural and compositional information to determine the partitioning behavior of transition elements like Ta and Mo between gamma matrix and gamma' precipitates and their site occupancy within the gamma' phase. The addition of Ta, which enhances the formation of gamma', to a ternary Co-Al-W alloy with stoichiometric Co-3(Al,W) precipitates, results in the substitution of only the W in the gamma' precipitates to form Co-3(Al, W, Ta) precipitates. Interestingly, Mo, typically considered a gamma solid solution strengthener in nickel-base alloys, also partitions strongly to gamma' precipitates when added to the Co-Al-W alloy and displaces only the W atoms. The experimentally observed equal atomic substitution of W by both Ta and Mo, without any change in the Al content within the gamma' precipitates, gives insights into the energetics of relative site substitutions in this ordered compound.

TI Microstructural Evolution of a Ni-base Alloy DZ468 Joint Bonded with a
   New Co-base Filler
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Ni-base alloy DZ468 has been joined by transient liquid phase bonding technique with a newly developed Co-based filler. The microstructures of the Co-base filler and the joint, the effects of heat treatment on microstructure and hardness of the joint have been investigated by various experimental methods. Results show that the Co-base filler consists of gamma, M2B, M5B3 and M23B6 phases. Because of the interdiffusion between the base metal and the filler, gamma, MC, M5B3 and M23B6 phases are formed in the bonding zone. And localized liquidation of substrate occurs in the diffusion affected zone, with MC and M3B2 precipitating in this area. During heat treatment, the volume of the intermetallic phases in the bonding zone resulting from incomplete isothermal solidification decreases obviously. On the contrary, the width of the diffusion affected zone increases at the solution stage and subsequently decreases at the aging stages.

TI The Effect of Volatilisation of Refractory Metal Oxides on the Cyclic
   Oxidation of Ni-base Superalloys
SO OXIDATION OF METALS
AB The role of refractory metals on the bare oxidation behaviour of a range of compositionally complex single crystal Ni-base superalloys has been investigated using a range of techniques. It has been shown that this series of fourth generation alloys were borderline alumina formers at 1,100 A degrees C, and their cyclic oxidation performance was detrimentally affected by increased levels of Mo and Co. In addition, there was strong evidence that Re, Ru and Mo were lost through the process of cyclic oxidation, which supports the hypothesis that these elemental additions were lost through volatilisation/sublimation, contributing to their poor cyclic oxidation performance.

TI The effect of Mn1.5Co1.5O4 coatings on the development of near surface
   microstructure for Haynes 230 oxidized at 800 degrees C in air
SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB The effect of reactively sintered Mn1.5Co1.5O4 (MCO) coatings on the development of surface microstructure for Haynes 230 (H230) oxidized in air at 800 degrees C has been studied using a combination of thermo-gravimetric analysis and electron microscopy techniques. The bare alloy exhibits a parabolic rate constant of 8.8 x 10(-9) mg(2)m(-4)s(-1) and forms a two-layer oxide scale with a continuous chromia layer and a thinner discontinuous MnCr2O4 overlayer. For the MCO-coated H230, the reduction step of the reactive sintering process converts the MCO coating to a mixture of Co and MnO with a thin Cr-rich oxide layer at the interface with the alloy substrate. Following the re-oxidation step, there is a 200 nm chromia layer and a 400 nm cubic spinel reaction layer (RL) between the alloy and the MCO. These layers thicken to 800 nm and 1.2 mu m, respectively after 1000 h oxidation. These observations are compared to our previous studies of MCO-coated Crofer 22 APU, and the implications for long-term SOFC performance are discussed. (C) 2014 United Technologies Research Center.

TI Computer simulation of phase transformation and plastic deformation in
   IN718 superalloy: Microstructural evolution during precipitation
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB Microstructural evolution during co-precipitation of gamma', gamma '' and delta phases from a supersaturated gamma matrix during aging of superalloy Inconel 718 (IN718) is investigated by computer simulation using the phase-field method. The precipitation model is quantitative, using as model inputs ab initio calculations of elastic constants, experimental data on lattice parameters, precipitate matrix orientation relationship, interfacial energy of each individual precipitate phase and interdiffusivities, and a Ni-Nb-Al pseudo-ternary thermodynamic database specifically developed for IN718. In order to simulate statistically representative multiphase microstructures observed in the alloy, the Kim-Kim-Suzuki treatment of interfaces is employed. Simulation results show how alloy composition, lattice misfit, external stress, temperature and time affect precipitate microstructure and variant selection during isothermal aging, without any a priori assumptions about key microstructural features including size, shape, volume fraction and spatial distribution of different types of precipitates and different variants of the same precipitate phase. The shapes of precipitates and their coarsening kinetics are analyzed based on the two-dimensional moment invariant. The various multiphase microstructures generated by the simulations have been used as model inputs in a study to investigate how precipitate microstructure (in particular shape and spatial distribution) influences the strength of IN718.

TI Build direction dependence of microstructure and high-temperature
   tensile property of Co-Cr-Mo alloy fabricated by electron beam melting
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB The microstructures and high-temperature tensile properties of a Co-28Cr-6Mo-0.23C-0.17N alloy fabricated by electron beam melting (EBM) with cylindrical axes deviating from the build direction by 0 degrees, 45 degrees, 55 degrees and 90 degrees were investigated. The preferred crystal orientations of the gamma phase in the as-EBM-built samples with angles of 0 degrees, 45 degrees, 55 degrees and 90 degrees were near [0 0 1], [1 1 0], [1 1 1] and [1 0 0], respectively. M23C6 precipitates (M = Cr, Mo or Si) were observed to align along the build direction with intervals of around 3 mu m. The phase was completely transformed into a single epsilon-hexagonal close-packed (hcp) phase after aging treatment at 800 degrees C for 24 h, when lamellar colonies of M2N precipitates and the epsilon-hcp phase appeared in the matrix. Among the samples, the one built with 55 degrees deviation had the highest ultimate tensile strength of 806 MPa at 700 degrees C. The relationship between the microstructure and the build direction dependence of mechanical properties suggested that the conditions of heat treatment to homogenize the microstructure throughout the height of the EBM-built object should be determined by taking into account the thermal history during the post-melt period of the EBM process, especially when the solid solid transformation is sluggish.

SO CORROSION SCIENCE
AB Isothermal oxidation in air was carried out on a gamma'-strengthened single crystalline Co-Al-W-B superalloy at 800, 900, and 1000 degrees C. The absence of grain boundaries leads to inferior oxidation properties at 800 and 900 degrees C, and improved properties at 1000 degrees C, compared to a polycrystalline alloy of the same composition. At lower temperatures, grain boundary diffusion is dominant and assumed to be the reason for enhanced B-accumulation in the inner oxide layer and enhanced formation of the protective inner Al2O3 layer. However, at 1000 degrees C superior oxidation resistance of the single crystalline superalloy can be observed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   behavior of aluminized nickel-base single crystal superalloys
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB The influences of ruthenium and surface orientation on creep behavior of aluminized Ni-base single crystal superalloys were investigated by comparing two different types of NKH superalloys. The aluminized coated specimens were then subjected to creep rupture tests at a temperature of 900 degrees C and a stress of 392 MPa. The coating treatment resulted in a significant decrease in creep rupture lives for both superalloys. The diffusion zones between the coating and substrate led to changes in microstructure, which diminished the creep behavior of the aluminized superalloys. Because of the interdiffusion of Ru, Al and Ni, the solubility of some of the refractory elements, such as W, Re. Mo, Co and Cr decreased in the diffusion zone; the precipitation of topologically close-packed (TCP) phases was thus inevitable. In the present study, the addition of Ru increased the degree of Re and Cr supersaturation in the gamma matrix. Consequently, the addition of Ru indirectly promoted the precipitation of TCP phases in aluminized Ni-base single crystal superalloys. Furthermore, the growth of TCP precipitates was greatly influenced by the specific surface orientations of the Ni-base single crystal superalloys. In conclusion, the {110} specimens showed shorter creep rupture life than the {100} specimens, this was due to the difference in the crystallographic geometry of {111}< 101 > slip system and TCP precipitates between the two side-surface orientations of the specimens.

TI HOT CORROSION RESISTANCE OF FILLER ALLOY BCo46
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB DZ468 alloy is a promising candidate in turbine blade serving in marine atmosphere because of its superior mechanical properties and good hot corrosion resistance. And brazing technology is indispensable to produce turbine blade because of its complicated hollow structure. Therefore, for accelerating the application of DZ468 superalloy, a new type Co-based filler named BCo46 was developed. Due to serving in marine atmosphere, the attack of hot corrosion can be inevitable. Frequently, the quality of turbine blade depends on the joining region, and the joining region has a lot to do with the filler used to braze the base alloy. Therefore, in this work, the hot corrosion behavior and mechanism of BCo46 alloy in the mixture of 75%Na2SO4 + 25%NaCl (mass fraction) at 900 degrees C was investigated, and compared with a common Ni-based filler BNi-2, and the base alloy DZ468. Moreover, the hot corrosion resistance of the joint bonded with BCo46 was evaluated. XRD, SEM, EDS and ICP spectrograph were employed to study the corrosion products of the tested alloys. The results show that the hot corrosion processes of BCo46, BNi-2 and DZ468 alloys are all accompanied with the dissolution of oxide scale and the formation of sulfide, which support the model of sulfidation-(acid-based) melting model. For filler alloy BCo46, Cr2O3, Co3BO5 and (Ni, Co)Cr2O4 mainly exist in the outer corrosion layer and some CrS is formed in the inner corrosion layer; the external corrosion products of BNi-2 are NiO, (Ni, Co)Cr2O4, Ni2FeBO5 and Cr2O3, and the internal precipitation is Ni2S3. The hot corrosion resistance of filler alloy BCo46 is superior to DZ468 superalloy and BNi-2 filler, it is because (1) BCo46 contains 22% Cr which can form dense and continuous oxide scale Cr2O3; (2) the diffusion rates of 0 and S are slower in Co- than Ni-based alloy; (3) Co can increase the adhesion of the oxide scale-base metal; (4) collaboration dissolution doesn't occur in BCo46. Furthermore, the formation of boride can deteriorate the hot corrosion resistance of alloy by forming oxides of boron which can dissolve oxide scale, consume Cr and increase phase interfacial area to accelerate the diffusion of S and O. The joint after heat treatment can reach the level of the hot corrosion resistance of the base metal DZ468.

AB The 60 Hz, Frame 7F engine has been in commercial operation for more than two decades now with approximately 800 Frame 7 (F, FA, FA+ and FA+e models) machines existing in North America and a total of over 1100 F-class machines throughout the world. Of importance to operators/users and owners of this gas turbine engine is the ability to not only recondition the turbine "hot-end section" components, in order to support maintenance requirements, but also to reduce the life cycle costs of these components.
   Stage 1 nozzles are a cast doublet, manufactured from FSX-414 Co-based superalloy. There are 24 nozzles in an engine set. As a result of the extreme turbine inlet temperatures at the 1st stage nozzle, these components experience severe thermal fatigue cracking. On one particular OEM engine set inspected, over 600 cracks were identified on each nozzle after engine operation. As a consequence, the stage 1 nozzles when compared to the other components in the engine exhibits the worst degradation and is therefore a focus point of reconditioning for those in the industry.
   The technical objective is to describe the development of a repair scheme for the stage 1 nozzle that can successfully address and repair this level of severe cracking and oxidation, with 0% scrap/fallout for a heavy repair, after a normal duty cycle. Special processes have been established for these components repairs, including but not limited to removal of the damaged and oxidized trailing edges by machining, high frequency Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW) of new trailing edge coupons.
   This technical paper describes the repair process development and implementation of the different stages of the repair schemes and shows metallurgical and mechanical characteristics of the repaired regions of the component. As a result of successfully executing these special processes, although a heavy repair workscope was implemented; all the nozzles were successfully repaired without any scrap.

AB The role of Ti on a new Co-based gamma/gamma' two phase superalloy was investigated. Scanning Electron Microscopy(SEM), X-ray Diffraction(XRD) were employed to study the microstructure of alloys with various Ti contents. The volume of gamma' rise steadily with the increase of Ti content, and the morphology switched from fine rod-like to regular cubical when the Ti concentration is over 6%. The addition of Ti reduced the misfit between gamma/gamma' phase, the misfit of the alloy with 8% Ti was only 0.15%. The room temperature hardness was improved with the increase of Ti content, which peaked when the Ti content is 8%, then dropped. The results indicated that Ti is an key element in the alloying development of Co-Al-W based superalloys.

AB Effect of C on wettability and interface reaction between a nickel based superalloy and ceramic material was investigated by using a sessile drop method. It was found that the content of C in the alloy is able to influence the wettability and interface reaction. Alloys with C content lower than 0.1wt.% are stable on ceramic material and no interface reaction generates at the alloy-ceramic interface. However, when C content is higher than 0.1wt.%, the interface reaction occurs and the wetting angle decreases quickly. The product of interface reaction is discontinuous and composed of 9Al(2)O(3)center dot Cr2O3. Such result indicates that Cr in the alloy is impossible to react with the ceramic material and form Cr2O3 without the assistance of C. It is suggested that C in the alloy deoxidizes SiO2 in the ceramic material and produces SiO and CO. SiO is unstable and it can release active O atom at the interface. Cr at the interface combines with free O atom and forms Cr2O3 center dot Al2O3 in the ceramic material and Cr2O3 finally forms 9Al(2)O(3)center dot Cr2O3.

AB Interim results from the development of a polycrystalline Co-Al-W based superalloy are presented. Cr has been added to provide oxidation resistance and Ni has then been added to widen and stabilise the gamma' phase field. The alloy presented has a solvus of 1010 degrees C and a density of 8.7 g cm(-3). The room temperature flow stress is over 1000 MPa and this reduces dramatically above 800 degrees C. The flow stress anomaly is observed. A microstructure with both similar to 50 nm gamma ' produced on cooling and larger 100-200 nm gamma ' can be obtained. Isothermal oxidation at 800 degrees C in air for 200 h gave a mass gain of 0.96 mg cm(-2). After hot deformation in the 650-850 degrees C temperature range, both anti phase boundaries (APBs) and stacking faults could be observed. An APB energy of 71 mJm(-2) was measured, which is comparable to that found in commercial nickel superalloys.

The investigation has been performed for the superalloy after standard heat treatment and the ex-service CMSX-4 turbine blade after operation for 12 700 hours and 200 starts in industrial gas turbine. The results have shown that Co, Cr and Re partition to the gamma matrix, Ni and W are present in both gamma and gamma' phases, while Al, Ti and Ta strongly partition to the gamma' phase. The results show the abilities of new analytical electron microscopy and electron tomography methods to characterize the microstructure and chemical composition of single crystal superalloys at the nanoscale.

AB Thermal cycles during laser cladding can alter mechanical properties of the original part significantly. In case of cyclically loaded parts residual stresses are suspected to be a property strongly determining fatigue life. Therefore, in this paper the influence of processing and post-processing strategies on resulting residual stresses are determined by neutron-diffraction. A low-alloy as well as a high-alloy steel have been considered within this study, both cladded with the Co-based superalloy Stellite 21. Processing speed and post -treatment by laser annealing and by deep rolling strategies have been tested. Residual stresses in low-alloyed steel show high sensitivity on applied treatment strategies. In the present study only deep rolling induced compressive residual stress close to the part surface. In high-alloy steel compressive stress in this area resulted directly after laser cladding, where its magnitude depends on processing speed. A compressive residual stress state which is suspected to be beneficial for fatigue strength could be achieved at the two representative steels.

AB MCrA1Y alloys (where M stands for Ni,Co or both) are commonly used as overlay protective coatings in gas turbine engine components against high temperature oxidation and corrosion. The protective effect of these alloys is due to the formation of a continuous thermally stable oxide layer on the coating surface. In this work several types of MCrA1Y alloys, differing in their elemental composition, have been deposited on austenitic stainless steel by means of laser cladding. The microstructure of the coatings have been characterized by SEM-EDS and XRD. As expected, elemental composition compatible with gamma Ni/gamma' Ni3A1, gamma Ni/beta-NiAl or gamma Co/beta-(Co,Ni)A1 phases are observed in hypoeutectic or hypereutectic microstructures depending on the alloy composition. The high temperature oxidation behavior of the coatings was evaluated by air furnace oxidation tests at 1100 degrees C for 200 h. The oxidized surface of the samples was examined by SEM-EDS and the oxides present identified by theoretical stoichiometric calculations. Results indicate the formation of a uniform A1(3)O(2) protective oxide scale with NiO, CoO, Y2O3/YA1O(3) and Cr2O3 oxide inclusions.

TI ANALYSIS OF THE INFLUENCE OF CHEMICAL COMPOSITION AND TEMPERATURE ON
   MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF SUPERALLOYS NIMONIC 80A
SO METALURGIJA
AB Superalloys Nimonic 80A is a wrought nickel base alloy (min. 65 % Ni) and chromium (20 %), with minor additions of carbon, cobalt and iron, as well as major alloying elements of aluminum (1 to 1,8%) and titanium (1,8 to 2,7 %). Chemical composition of the alloy Nimonic 80A has a dominant influence on its mechanical and technological properties. Increasing of the temperature also has a large influence on the mechanical properties of superalloy Nimonic 80A
   Investigations which were carried out have included chemical testing and testing of mechanical properties of superalloy Nimonic 80A at room and higher temperatures. Regression analysis was done on the base of chemical analyses and results of mechanical properties. The results of regression analysis are equations by which on the basis of known chemical composition, ie content of main alloying elements Al, Ti and Co, the mechanical properties of materials at room and higher temperatures can be predicted.

AB Cast NiCrAl alloys with additions of Y, La, Hf and Ti were evaluated at 1100 degrees C in wet (10 and 50% H2O) and dry air (0% H2O) in order to optimize such dopants for superalloy bond coatings. The results suggest that the typical Y addition in most coatings could be replaced by La. Also, scale adhesion in cyclic testing was improved with the co-addition of Hf with La or Y. Ti was added to investigate its incorporation in coatings on superalloys containing significant Ti additions. Particularly with co-doped alloys, the addition of Ti had little effect on scale adhesion but did reduce the depth of internal oxidation. Water vapor increased spallation, especially for the least adherent alloys, such as Y,Ti-doped NiCrAl. For the co-doped compositions with Hf, water vapor had a limited effect on scale adhesion and on the alumina growth rate in isothermal exposures. In addition to specimen mass change, the extent of internal oxidation and the depletion of beta phase in the substrate were evaluated. Analytical transmission electron microscopy showed that Y, La and Hf co-segregated to the alumina scale grain boundaries and formed dopant-rich oxide precipitates in the scale.

TI Microstructural modelling solution for complex Co based alloys and

SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB Microstructural changes following oxidation at high temperatures of a complex coating or alloy can significantly influence its properties. This paper investigates possible solutions that can accurately model alloy microstructures that result from such a process in a cobalt-rich CoNiCrAIReY bond coat alloy system. Four different alloys with varying aluminum content were studied after heat treatments at 1000 degrees C or 1150 degrees C. SEM, EPMA and XRD were used to characterize the alloy microstructure, and hardness testing was performed to determine the role of microstructure on mechanical properties. Experimental microstructures were modeled using two databases of Thermo-Calc, namely TTNI8 and SSOL5. Effects of Al content on phase changes and materials properties were quantitatively investigated. Data showed that a 1 wt. % increase of Al in the alloy caused an 8% increase in the beta phase, and a Cr and Re rich sigma phase precipitated preferentially at high Al concentrations. In addition, alloy hardness was found to increase by 4 and 81%, respectively, with a 10% increase in the beta and sigma phases. Modeled results using the TTNI8 database showed excellent agreement with experimental observations, but the SSOL5 database produced erroneous information. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI MICROSTRUCTURE EVOLUTION AND MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF DD5 SINGLE CRYSTAL
   SUPERALLOY JOINT BRAZED BY Co-BASED FILLER ALLOY
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB The single crystal supperalloy DD5 was brazed using Co-Ni-Si-B filler alloy at 1453 K. The microstructure of joint and effect of brazing time on the microstructure and mechanical properties were investigated by SEM, EPMA and TEM. The formation mechanism of joint was discussed deeply. The result indicates that three distinct regions can be identified in a joint: the filler alloy zone, interfacial bonding zone, element diffusion zone. The filler alloy zone in the center of joint consists of Ni-Co solid solution, M3B2-type boride, CrB and Ni-Si compounds. The interfacial bonding zone adjacent to the filler alloy zone is composed of Ni-Co solid solution formed isothermally at brazing temperature. The element diffusion zone between the interfacial bonding zone and substrate consists of gamma phase, gamma' phase and granular M3B2 phase which was formed in element diffusion. With extending brazing time, the brazing defects reduce, the thickness of bonding layer and the size of spherical Ni-Co solid solution in the filler alloy zone increase, and the brittle compounds reduce. The tensile strength at 1143 K increases from 198.5 MPa to 580 MPa. The investigation on fracture of high temperature tensile specimens exhibits that the fracture occurred in the seam and the fractural model is a mixed fracture. Through extending brazing time the bonding strength between seam and substrate can be improved, the brittle compounds can be controlled and the mechanical properties of joint are improved. The analysis results of microstructure and properties also imply that the optimum holding time would be 180 min.

TI Sulphidation Behavior of a Non Harmful Water-Based Al and Al-Si Slurry
   Coating on CM247 Superalloy
SO OXIDATION OF METALS
AB Slurry aluminide coatings are widely applied to protect metallic surfaces from oxidation and corrosion. They are frequently used in gas turbine engine nozzles because of economical advantages and a straight-forward manufacturing route. A variety of commercial slurries are available to aluminize the surfaces of nickel-based superalloys, however, they have two main disadvantages. First, the phosphates and chromates or halides used as binders and to activate the diffusion species are environmentally harmful; second, the conventional systems have to be heat-treated in an inert atmosphere. As an outcome of the PARTICOAT project the variety of slurry derived coatings has been extended by tailoring the particle size of the metallic source. By doing that, environmentally friendly water-based slurries were developed to produce in a one-step process und atmospheric conditions, a thermal barrier system based on an aluminum diffusion layer and an alumina foam layer which serves as bond coat as well as top coat (TC). CM 247 nickel base superalloy was coated and heat-treated in air using newly developed Al and Al-Si slurries. The oxidation behavior was investigated at 1,000 A degrees C and then compared to pack-cemented aluminide coatings. The sulphidation behavior was investigated at 1,000 A degrees C in an atmosphere of 1.5 vol% SO2 in synthetic air for Al and Al-Si slurry coated samples with and without the alumina foam TC layer. PARTICOAT Al-based slurries,, after the initial stabilization of the TC, showed similar oxidation kinetics as pack cemented aluminides when exposed to air. When the coatings were exposed to sulphide-containing atmospheres, their oxidation rates increased, producing typical type I corrosion damage. Coatings without TC produced more protective oxide scales. The weight gain and coating area affected by corrosion were slightly lower for the Al-based slurries after 1,000 h of exposure than for the Al-Si based ones. The new coating presented here offers unique advantages in comparison to state-of-the-art slurry and pack cemented coatings by opening a potential way to manufacture a complete thermal barrier coating system by a simple, inexpensive and environmentally safe deposition and heat-treatment in air.

TI Lattice misfit during ageing of a polycrystalline nickel-base superalloy
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB The temporal evolution of the lattice parameters and lattice misfit of an advanced polycrystalline nickel-base superalloy have been studied in situ during an ageing heat treatment using synchrotron X-ray diffraction. During ageing, the gamma and gamma' lattice parameters were both observed to decrease, a trend that cannot be attributed to a loss of coherency alone. Phase-extracted gamma' replicated this behaviour. Atom probe tomography was used to measure the compositional changes between the start and end of the ageing heat treatment. Using these data, a thermodynamic assessment was made using the software ThermoCalc of the structural change across the interface between gamma and gamma'. Subsequently, the unconstrained lattice parameters were estimated and were shown to be in good agreement with the X-ray diffraction measurements. Thus, the observed anomalous lattice misfit behaviour was concluded to be dominated by elemental exchange between the gamma and gamma' phases during ageing. (C) 2013 Acta Materialia Inc.

TI Effect of B on microstructure and properties of low thermal expansion
   superalloy
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The effect of B on microstructure and various properties including coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), HV hardness, and both smooth and notch stress rupture properties of modified Thermo-Span alloy was studied. The results show that B hardly dissolves in matrix. Increasing B content constrains the formation of Laves phase and grain boundary (GB) precipitation of Laves and G phases, but promotes the formation of M(Co, Fe)NbB boride. In low B doped alloy, its intrinsic high susceptibility to intergranular cracks leads to reduced rupture life and notch sensitivity. Increasing B improves grain boundary cohesion, tying up vacancies and reducing GB diffusion, which constrains the nucleation and propagation of intergranular microcracks, prolongs the rupture life and eliminates the notch sensitivity in the new alloy. Compared with conventional Thermo-Span alloy, the B doped modified alloy shows lower CTE and improved notch sensitivity.

TI Microstructural evolution and mechanical properties of friction stir
   welded ODS alloy MA754
SO JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS
AB Microstructural evolution and mechanical properties of MA754, an yttrium oxide dispersion-strengthened nickel-based superalloy, were investigated after friction stir welding (FSW). A tool rotation rate of 1000 revolution per minute and a traverse speed of 50.8 mm per minute were employed using a cermet (WC-Co) tool. After FSW, fine equiaxed grain structure with a high dislocation density and a random texture was achieved. Agglomeration of yttrium oxide dispersoids was observed in FSW MA754. Room-temperature tensile properties of FSW MA754 were compared to those of as-received MA754 alloy, and the results indicated that particle strengthening contribution decreased as a result of dispersoid agglomeration.

TI Atom probe tomographic study of L1(0) martensite in a Pt-modified
   NiCoCrAlYTa bond coating
SO CORROSION SCIENCE
AB The L1(0) martensite formed in a Pt-modified NiCoCrAlYTa bond coating has been investigated by atom probe tomography. It was found that obvious segregation of Co and Cr occurred in the micro-twins zone inside the martensite lath. Based upon the compositional analysis, it is known that Pt destabilizes the beta phase and Co and Cr act as beta stabilizers with respect to the beta -> 4 L1(0) martensitic transformation. In addition, some alpha-Cr particles precipitated inside the martensite lath. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Trends in fireside corrosion damage to superheaters in air and
   oxy-firing of coal/biomass
SO FUEL
CT 9th European Conference on Coal Research and its Applications (9th
   ECCRIA)
CY SEP 10-12, 2012
CL Nottingham, ENGLAND
AB This paper compares the laboratory-based fireside corrosion tests on superheater/reheater materials in simulated air-firing combustion conditions with oxy-firing combustion conditions (with hot gas recycling before flue gas de-sulphurisation). The gaseous combustion environment was calculated based on a specific co-firing ratio of CCP with Daw Mill coal. The fireside corrosion tests were carried out using the "deposit recoat'' test method to simulate the damage anticipated in specific environments. A synthetic deposit (Na-2 SO4:K2SO4:Fe2O3 = 1.5:1.5:1 mol.) which has commonly been used in fireside corrosion screening trials and is a mix that forms alkali-iron tri-sulphate (identified in many investigations as a cause of fireside corrosion) was used in these tests. The air-fired tests were carried out at temperatures of 600, 650 and 700 degrees C and oxy-fired tests were carried out at temperatures of 600, 650, 700 and 750 degrees C to represent the superheater/reheater metal temperatures anticipated in future power plants with and without synthetic deposits, with four candidate materials: T92, HR3C and 347HFG steels; nickel-based alloy 625 (alloy 625 was only tested with screening deposits). The progress of the samples during their exposures was measured using mass change methods. After the exposures, the samples were examined by SEM/EDX to characterise the damage. To quantify the metal damage, pre-exposure micrometre measurements were compared to the post-exposure image analyser measurements on sample cross-sections. The trends in corrosion damage in both air and oxy-firing conditions showed a "bell-shaped'' curve, with the highest metal damage levels (peak) observed at 650 degrees C for air-firing and 700 degrees C for oxy-firing tests. However, at 600 and 650 degrees C similar damage levels were observed in both environments. The shift in peak corrosion damage in oxy-firing condition is believed to be the presence of higher levels of SOx, which stabilised the alkali-iron tri-sulphate compounds. Generally, in both air and oxy-firing conditions the mean metal damage was reduced with increasing the amount of Cr in the alloys. However, at the highest temperatures in both air-firing (700 degrees C) and oxy-firing conditions (750 degrees C) the metal damage of nickel based superalloy 625 was higher than HR3C.

TI Oxidation behaviour and mechanism of a cobalt based superalloy between
   1050 and 1250 degrees C
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB A new Co-base superalloy 22Co-21Ni-23Fe-29Cr-2.2Nb (Co22 for short) was developed, and the influence of a trace amount of rare earth (RE) on the oxidation resistance was investigated. Isothermal oxidation behaviour of this Co-base superalloy was investigated at 1050-1250 degrees C in air, analyzed with scanning electronic microscopy and X-ray diffraction. The results show that oxidation mass gain of the samples with or without RE elements obeyed secondary parabolic law, and the effect of 0.03 wt.% RE on oxidation resistance is small. The oxidation rate constant of the 0.03 wt.% RE added Co22 alloy decreases by about 6.1% to 9.0% compared to that of the Co22 alloy without RE. Oxidation at 1050-1250 degrees C for 100 h results in the formation of MnCr2O4, Cr2O3 and SiO2. A continuous and protective MnCr2O4 spinel layer forms as outer layer. The continuous middle oxide layer is confirmed to be Cr2O3, and the innermost layer consists of discontinuous SiO2. The outer and middle layers strongly improve oxidation resistance and oxide layer adhesion because of their continuity and compactness, and the innermost SiO2 layer forms a diffusion barrier to prevent further oxidation. Formation and growth mechanisms of oxide layers were also discussed. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Corrosion behaviour of Al-29at%Co alloy in aqueous NaCl
SO CORROSION SCIENCE
AB Microstructure and corrosion behaviour of a binary Al-29 at%Co alloy have been studied. The alloy was prepared by arc-melting of Al and Co in high purity Ar and rapidly solidified on a water-cooled Cu mould. The alloy chemical composition and microstructure were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. Furthermore, the corrosion behaviour was studied by potentiodynamic polarization in aqueous NaCl (0.6 mol dm(-3)) at room temperature. The alloy was found to consist of three phases: hexagonal Al5Co2, Z-phase and AlCo (beta). The corrosion resistance of different intermetallic phases is characterized. The results are compared to previously published results of Al-TM (TM = transition metal) alloys. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI CREEP MECHANISM OF A Ni-Co BASE WROUGHT SUPERALLOY
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB Ni-based wrought superalloys are widely used in the hot section of aircraft gas turbine engines for their capability in retaining strength and resisting creep, fatigue, and oxidation at elevated temperature. With the development of the newer generation turbine disk alloys, it is highly imperative for aircraft engine manufacturers to substantiate the use of the materials by conducting a thorough examination of their mechanical properties. As these components are subjected to elevated temperatures and complex stress state in the service process where time dependent creep is the primary deformation failure mechanism and life-limiting factor for the component, it is of great importance to evaluate the relationship between microstructure, creep behavior and the underlying creep deformation mechanism. Therefore, the main objective of the present research aims at investigating the fundamental relationship between external creep condition and internal creep deformation mechanism in a new wrought superalloy with low stacking fault energy (SFE). In order to study the influences of the loading stress level and temperature on the creep deformation mechanism, stress range of 345-840 MPa and temperature range of 650-815 degrees C were selected to carry out the creep experiment. The results show that two kinds of gamma' with different diameters distributed in the matrix and the larger one began to coarsen when the creep temperature increased to 725 degrees C. Under creep temperature of 650 degrees C, the formation of SF resulted from the shearing of gamma' by dislocations dominated the creep deformation. When the temperature range was raised up to 725-760 degrees C, SF and microtwins were the main microstructures after creep deformation. With further increasing the temperature and load, instead of accommodating only in the gamma', the SF and microtwins penetrated the whole gamma' and matrix area. When the temperature was increased to 815 degrees C, the climb/bypass mechanism controlled the creep process.

TI Microstructure and oxidation behavior of Al and Hf co-deposition
   coatings on nickel-based superalloys
SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB This study focuses on investigating the microstructure and oxidation behavior of Al and Hf co-deposition diffusion coatings deposited by Pt electroplating followed by combined aluminizing and hafnizing using the pack cementation technique. The composition (in wt.%) of the packs was 2NiAl-2NH(4)Cl-xHf-(96 - x)Al2O3 with different Hf levels (x = 2, 6, 12 and 16), and the corresponding microstructure of the coatings was gamma-Ni + gamma'-Ni3Al, NiAl + Al16Hf6Ni7, Al16Hf6Ni7 and Al1.65HfNi0.35, respectively. In the post heat-treatment process, with Hf and Al diffusing towards the superalloy substrate and Ni diffusing in the opposite direction, Al16Hf6Ni7 and Al1.65HfNi0.35 were transformed into Ni3Al + Al3HfNi12 and NiAl + Al3HfNi12, respectively. The isothermal oxidation tests at 1000 degrees C in air indicated that the coating formed in the packs containing 2 wt.% Hf had the lowest weight gain, while the weight gain of the coating formed in the packs having 6 wt.% Hf was the largest. The mechanisms of Hf-rich phase formation and their effects on oxidation resistance of the coatings were discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Plastic deformation mechanisms in a crept L1(2) hardened Co-base
   superalloy
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB Plastic deformation mechanisms in a crept L1(2) hardened Co-base superalloy are investigated by transmission electron microscopy. The deformation happens mainly in the cobalt solid solution matrix by slip of ordinary a/2 < 101 > {111} dislocations and rafting of the gamma' precipitates perpendicular to the external compressive stress axis is observed. Dislocation structures are early stages of the development of gamma/gamma' interfacial dislocation networks. Furthermore, gamma' precipitates are sheared by partial dislocations generating stacking faults which sometimes extend over matrix channels and neighbouring gamma' precipitates. Due to the positive lattice mismatch at creep temperature the dislocation activity in matrix channels perpendicular to the compressive external stress axis is less pronounced compared to parallel channels.

TI The effect of nickel and silicon addition on some oxidation properties
   of novel Co-based, high temperature alloys
SO CORROSION SCIENCE
AB Isothermal oxidation was carried out on gamma'-strengthened Co-Al-W-B-Ni and Co-Al-W-B-Si superalloys at 800, 900, and 1000 degrees C. Ni-addition to Co-Al-W-B alloys leads to an absence of B within the inner oxide layer and at the grain boundaries, as indicated by ToF-SIMS. As a result, also inner Al2O3-formation is inhibited, which leads to inferior oxidation properties compared to Ni-free alloys. In contrast, Si-addition enhances formation of protective Al2O3 at 900 and 1000 degrees C due to enhanced selective Al-oxidation. Si-containing phases at the oxide/alloy interface, at the grain boundaries, and within precipitates are of subordinate importance but may further improve oxidation resistance. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

   Properties of LnMB11O19-type Magnetoplumbite LaMgAl11O19 for Advanced
   Thermal Barrier Coatings
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CERAMIC SOCIETY
AB Lanthanum hexaaluminate is a promising competitor to establish yttria partially stabilized zirconia as a thermal barrier coating material for Ni-based superalloy due to its relative low intrinsic thermal conductivity and low sinterability at temperatures exceeding 1100 degrees C. Sr2+ and Ti4+ were selected as two dopants to partially substitute the La3+ and Al3+ in LaMgAl11O19, respectively. The variation in thermal conductivity with Sr2+ and Ti4+ fractions was analyzed based on structure information provided by X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. The average crystal size of LaMgAl11O19 sintered at 1600 degrees C for 10min by spark plasma sintering is in nanoscale. The fully dense La1xSrxMgAl11xTixO19 solid solution showed a minimum thermal conductivity value (=1.12W/(mK)1,T=1273K) at the composition of La0.5Sr0.5MgAl10.5Ti0.5O19,which possibly reduces from the enhanced phonon scattering due to mass and strain fluctuations at the Ln3+ and B3+ sites.

TI Effects of alloying elements in GH99 superalloy on microstructure
   evolution of reactive brazing TiAl/GH99 joints
SO INTERMETALLICS
AB TiAl-based intermetallics and GH99 superalloy were joined by reactive brazing with Ti filler metal. The interfacial microstructure and the effects of main alloying elements Cr, Mo, W and Co originating in the GH99 superalloy on interfacial microstructure evolution of the joint were investigated. The results showed that the alloying elements were mainly concentrated in (Ni, Cr)(ss) (gamma) phase in the zone adjacent to the GH99 superalloy and Ti3Al(alpha(2)) + alpha-Ti + beta-Ti phase in the middle zone of the joint. Compared with Ni/Ti/TiAl joint, the alloying elements in GH99 superalloy delayed the formation of liquid phase in GH99/Ti/TiAl joint. Furthermore, these alloying elements dissolving into GH99/Ti/TiAl joint were beta-Ti phase stabilizing elements, which promoted the formation of beta-Ti + alpha-Ti + alpha(2) phase. In addition, these alloying elements had positive effects on the ductility and high temperature properties of GH99/Ti/TiAl joint. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Degradation behaviour of sputtered Co-Al coatings on superalloy
SO MATERIALS CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
AB Degradation behaviour of sputtered Co-Al coatings on Superni-718 substrate has been investigated. Cyclic high temperature oxidation tests were conducted on uncoated and coated samples at peak temperatures of 900 degrees C for up to 100 thermal cycles between the peak and room temperatures. The results showed that a dense scale formed on the coated samples during thermal cycling at the peak temperature of 900 degrees C. The external scale exhibited good spallation resistance during cyclic oxidation testing at both temperatures. The improvement in oxide scale spallation resistance is believed to be related to the fine-grained structure of the coating. Nanostructured Co-Al coatings on Superni-718 substrate were deposited by DC/RF magnetron sputtering. FE-SEM/EDS, AFM, and XRD were used to characterize the morphology and formation of different phases in the coatings, respectively. The Co-Al coating on superalloy substrate showed better performance of cyclic high temperature oxidation resistance due to its possession of beta-CoAl phase as Al reservoir and the formation of Al2O3 and spinel phases such as CoCr2O4 and CoAl2O4 in scale. The oxidation results confirmed an improved oxidation resistance of the Co-Al coating on superalloy as compare to bare substrate in air at 900 degrees C temperature up to 100 cycles.

TI HIGH TEMPERATURE OXIDATION BEHAVIOUR OF CoCrTaAlY+10%Al2O3 COATINGS
   PRODUCED BY HVOF
SO METALLURGIA ITALIANA
AB High temperature oxidation causes degradation of materials in aircraft engines. Typical coatings like MCrAlY (where M is Co, Ni or Fe) are used to prevent or retard oxidation. High Velocity Oxygen Fuel (HVOF) is a thermal spray technique used in this field.
   This work aims to characterize a reinforced CoCrTaAlY (+10% Al2O3) coating that has been thermally sprayed on CMSX-4 superalloy discs by HVOF. The samples were exposed at 1100 degrees C for long times (100-500 h) in air to develop oxidation. Interdiffusion processes were activated at high temperatures and microhardness values decreased as a function of time and distance from the surface. After 500h oxidation, hardness values in the coating were comparable to that in the matrix, with a 25% reduction compared to the pre-oxidized condition. At the same time, a strong aluminum oxide developed on the surface to protect the coating; the oxide was 5 pm thick after 96 h and higher than 12 pm after 50Ch. microstructure characterization was performed by light microscopy and SEM.

AB With the goal of investigating the reported detrimental effect of water vapor on thermal barrier coating (TBC) performance, furnace cycle experiments were conducted in dry O-2 and air with 10 and 50% water vapor at 1100 degrees C. The TBC systems evaluated were air plasma-sprayed (APS), yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) top coatings with high velocity oxy fuel (HVOF)-deposited NiCoCrAlY or NiCoCrAlYHfSi bond coating. Average TBC lifetime was reduced by 30% in air with 10% water vapor compared to cycling in dry O-2, using 1 h cycle durations. Superalloy substrates with Y and La additions also were investigated but showed no statistical change in the average TBC lifetime compared to the base CMSX4 superalloy. In all cases, the bond coating with Hf and Si additions increased YSZ lifetime by 20% or more. Experiments that increased water vapor to 50% showed no further decrease in TBC lifetime. Increasing the cycle frequency to 100 h resulted in a large increase in TBC lifetime, especially for the NiCoCrAlYHfSi bond coatings. Co-doping the NiCoCrAl bond coat with Y and Hf was beneficial to TBC lifetime, but did not mitigate the detrimental impact of water vapor. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI High temperature degradation behavior of sputtered nanostructured Co-Al
   coatings on superalloy
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB Microstructure and cyclic high temperature oxidation behavior of nanostructured Co-Al coatings on Superni-718 substrate have been investigated. Cyclic high temperature oxidation tests were conducted on uncoated and coated samples at peak temperatures of 800 degrees C and 900 degrees C for up to 100 thermal cycles between the peak and room temperatures. The results showed that bare substrate has higher oxidation resistance at 800 degrees C as compared to 900 degrees C and coated sample has slightly higher oxidation resistance at 900 degrees C. The external scale of both coated sample exhibited good spallation resistance during cyclic oxidation testing at both temperatures. The improvement in oxide scale spallation resistance is believed to be related to the fine-grained structure of the coating. Nanostructured Co-Al coatings on Superni-718 substrate were deposited by DC/ RF magnetron sputtering. FE-SEM/ EDS and XRD were used to characterize the morphology and formation of different phases in the coatings, respectively. The Co-Al coating on superalloy substrate showed better performance of cyclic high temperature oxidation resistance due to its possession of beta-CoAl phase as Al reservoir and the formation of Al2O3 and spinel phases such as CoCr2O4 and CoAl2O4 in the scale. The oxidation results confirmed an improved oxidation resistance of the Co-Al coating on superalloy as compared to bare substrate up to 100 cycles. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Repeated plastic instability accompanying serrated yielding in stress-strain curves and localization of deformation is observed during plastic deformation of many metallic alloys when tensile specimens are deformed under certain experimental conditions of temperature, strain rate, and pre-deformation. This phenomenon is referred to as the Portevin-Le Chatelier (PLC) effect. TMW alloy, a newly developed Ni-Co base superalloy for aircraft engine application, also exhibit PLC effect during tensile test at temperatures ranging from 300 degrees C to 600 degrees C, which are also the temperature range for engine working. In this paper, a 3D digital image correlation (3D DIC) measurement system was established to observe the localization of deformation (PLC band) in a tensile test performed on TMW alloy specimen at temperature of 400 degrees C. The 3D DIC system, with displacement measurement accuracy up to 0.01 pixels and strain measurement accuracy up to 100 mu epsilon, has a high performance in displacement field calculation with more than 10000 points every second on a 3.1G Hz CPU computer. The test result shows that, the PLC bands are inclined at an angle of about 60 to the tensile axis. Unlike tensile test performed on aluminums alloy, the widths of PLC bands of TMW alloy specimen, ranging from 4 mm to 4.5 mm, are much greater than the specimen thickness (0.25 mm).

AB The hot components of gas turbine are loaded by high stresses in presence of high-temperature oxidation and hot corrosion environment during service process. It is important to simulate the interaction of stress and hot corrosion on the components in real service situation. Effect of the ratios of salt mixtures of Na2SO4/NaCl and the coating amounts of salt mixtures on the microstructure and the high temperature stress-rupture properties of a corrosion resistant directionally solidified superalloy at 850 degrees C/500MT'a were investigated. The results demonstrated that the stress-rupture life decreased with the coated salt mixture ratio of Na2SO4/NaCl changing from 3:1 to 9:1. Stress-rupture lives of the alloy decreased from 63 h to 42 h, while the coated salt mixtures amount increased from 1 mg/cm(2) to 4 mg/cm(2), hereby the salt mixture contained 75% Na2SO4 and 25% NaCl. When the coating ratio of Na2SO4/NaCl was 9:1, the stratified corrosion products layers were composed of the (Ni, Co)O, Ni(Al, Cr)(2)O-4 layer, bright grey phase that be identified as CrWO4, and the underlying dispersed particle shape phase CrSx, the underlying layer forms the sulfides eutectic and leads to catastrophic destruction for the alloy, which decreased the stress-rupture lives dramatically.

AB Particle surface component and valence state of nickel-based superalloy FGH96 powders fabricated by argon gas atomization have been measured by X-ray phoelectron spectrometer (XPS) to recognize the effect of powder size, surface segregation and heat treating on the oxidation behavior of powders. Type and phase structure of prior particle boundaries (PPBs) precipitated in HIPed superalloy have been studied also. The results showed that prior particle surface segregation and oxidation happened during the powder collection and storage with the C, O, Ti elements enrichment and Ti, Cr, Al, Zr elements oxidation in the surface respectively. During the heat treating of 1150 degrees C/2h, normal segregation element Ti and Zr enriched more apparently in the particle surface, on the contrary, negative segregation elements Ni, Al and Co diffused into the particle inner. Furthermore, the higher oxygen level on particle surface enhanced to form much more oxides such as ZrO2, TiO2 and Cr2O3. During HIP process of 1150 degrees C/2h/150MPa, the oxide ZrO2 as the nuclei accelerated the preferential precipitation of MC-type carbides which forms the continuous harmful PPBs. Definitely, PPB precipitation depended on the prior particle surface segregation and oxidation, surface elements Ti, Cr and Nb enrichment and oxidation reaction enhancement in high temperature such as 1150 degrees C. Small powders always had little segregation in the surface and thin oxidation layer, but had more oxygen content per weight for its higher specific surface. So using some powders with optimum particle size and lower oxygen content can help to reduce the PPB precipitation.

TI Influences of Co, Cu and V on Kinetics of Discontinuous Precipitation in
   the Ni-Cr System
SO ISIJ INTERNATIONAL
AB The effects of Co, Cu and V on the kinetics of discontinuous precipitation in the Ni-Cr system were experimentally examined using ternary Ni-39Cr-1.0Co, Ni-39Cr-1.2Cu and Ni-39Cr-0.89V alloys. The alloys were homogenized at 1 423 K for 3 h, solution treated at 1 423 K for 1 h, and then isothermally annealed in the temperature range of 873-1 023 K for various times up to 2 300 h. Due to the solution heat treatment, all the alloys show the polycrystalline single-phase microstructure of the Ni-rich solid-solution (gamma) phase with the face-centered cubic structure. During isothermal annealing, however, the cell of the lamellar microstructure composed of the gamma phase and the Cr-rich solid-solution (alpha) phase with the body-centered cubic structure is produced along the grain boundary of the gamma matrix and then grows into the gamma matrix. At each annealing temperature, the migration distance of the moving cell boundary increases in proportion to the annealing time. Thus, the growth rate of the cell is constant independent of the annealing time. The growth rate and the interlamellar spacing of the cell almost monotonically increase with increasing annealing temperature at 873-1 023 K. The cell growth is slightly accelerated by Cu but not by Co and V. However, the acceleration is less remarkable at 1 023 K. A kinetic model for the binary discontinuous precipitation controlled by boundary diffusion was used to analyze quantitatively the experimental result. In the moving cell boundary, the thermodynamic interaction is attractive between Cr and V but repulsive between Cr and Cu. Therefore, it is anticipated that the boundary diffusion of Cr along the moving cell boundary may be expedited by V but retarded by Cu. According to the analysis, however, the Cr boundary diffusion is hardly affected by Cu and V as well as Co. On the other hand, the boundary diffusion is lightly faster for Cu than for Co but slower for V than for Co. Consequently, for Cu and V, the thermodynamic and diffusional contributions to the Cr boundary diffusion are compensated each other.

TI Effect of Alloying Elements on Friction and Wear Performance of Novel
   Co-Al-W Superalloys
SO RARE METAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING
AB Novel Co-Al-W superalloy is a novel Co-base superalloy, with the precipitation strengthening by a ternary compound gamma'-Co-3(Al,W) phase on gamma-Co matrix. The effect of alloying element Mo, Nb, Ta and Ti on friction and wear performance of Co-Al-W superalloys at room temperature was studied by THT07-135 type friction and wear tester and SEM, and cobalt-based Stellite 6 alloy was employed for comparison. Results show that the friction coefficient of 9.8W superalloy is smaller than that of cobalt-based Stellite 6. Alloying elements Mo, Nb and Ti can moderately reduce wear mass loss and friction coefficient of 9.8W superalloy, and improve the wear resistance. The Mo, Ti and Nb elements can clearly improve the wear resistance of 9.8W superalloy while the effect of Ta element is not obvious. The wear mechanism of Co-Al-W superalloy is mainly oxidation and abrasive wear, while that of Stellite 6 alloy mainly is delamination and abrasive wear.

AB 2 at.% and 4 at.% Mo were added to Co-9Al-9W-2Ta-0.02B alloy to replace W (hereafter referred to as the alloys of 2Mo and 4Mo, respectively; Mo-free alloy was referred to as the 0Mo alloy). The effects of Mo additions on the high temperature oxidation behavior of the alloys at 800 degrees C in air have been studied. The results indicated that, after oxidation in air at 800 degrees C for 100 h, the oxide film of the 0Mo alloy remained intact, but the cracking and spallation of the oxide film took place in the alloys of 2Mo and 4Mo. Oxidation kinetic curves revealed weight gain per unit area of the 0Mo alloy was 36.86 mg.cm(-2), which was lower than that of the alloys of 2Mo (65.16 mg.cm(-2)) and 4Mo (48.54mg.cm(-2)). These suggested that the 0Mo alloy displayed superior oxidation resistance compared to the alloys of 2Mo and 4Mo caused by the formation of volatile MoO3 oxide, and sharp compressive stress formed in the outer layer during the oxidation. The oxide layer was composed of three layers of the Co3O4 + CoO outer layer, middle complex oxide layer containing Co, Al and W (Mo), inner Al2O3 layer and y/Co3W zone adhere to the gamma/gamma' substrate.

TI Development of wrought precipitation strengthened IN939 superalloy
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The potential of cast IN939 superalloy to be converted to wrought alloy has been explored in the present work. For this objective, bars of cast alloy were rolled under different conditions and then subjected to various heat treatment cycles. The results indicated that the yield strength, ultimate tensile strength and ductility of the wrought IN939 alloy are superior to the cast version. The stress rupture properties of wrought IN939 superalloy are better than those of the widely used superalloys, such as Nimonic 90 and Waspaloy, and approach the alloy Nimonic 105 properties. This is very notable because Nimonic 105 contains similar to 45 vol.-% gamma' that is much greater than the volume fraction of those strengthening precipitates in the alloy IN939 (similar to 35%). On the whole, the wrought form of this alloy has a high potential for manufacturing hot components to be used safely under aggressive turbine environment.

   co-deposition process
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY
AB A pack cementation process for the co-deposition of Cr, Fe and Al onto open-cell nickel foam was developed. The reticulated open-cell Ni-Cr-Fe-Al foams were annealed to homogenize the material with 18.8 wt.% Cr, 11.3 wt.% Fe and 7.7 wt.% Al. The microstructure and phase composition of the Ni-Cr-Fe-Al foams were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). X-ray diffraction (XRD) and energy dispersive analysis (EDS). The results show that the coating is uniform and dense along the perimeter of the Ni strut, and consists of three layers: a Cr-Fe outer layer, an inner layer containing mostly Al and a transition zone. After homogenization annealing, the alloyed foams retain the hollow struts structure of the original pure nickel foams and the low relative densities. The Ni-Cr-Fe-Al alloy foams exhibit enhancement in absolute strength as compared to the pure nickel and Ni-35.2Cr foams. Furthermore, the Ni-Cr-Fe-Al alloy foams show excellent oxidation resistance and outperform the chromia-forming Ni-35.2Cr alloy foam after oxidation,it 900 and 1000 degrees C, which is mainly due to its high aluminum and chromium content leading to the formation of a continuous and adherent duplex oxide layer.

TI Microstructural Characterization of Co-Based ODS Alloys
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING AND PERFORMANCE
AB Co-based ODS alloys, strengthened by nanosized oxide dispersion and gamma' precipitates, are potential high-temperature structural materials. The characteristics of the mechanically alloyed powder and the microstructural evolution of the Co-based ODS alloys were investigated. The results revealed that mechanical alloying had induced the formation of supersaturated solid solution in immiscible Co-Al-W-based alloys, originating mainly from extensive grain boundary region, high dislocation density, and ample point defect. Chemical compositions of mechanically alloyed Co-Al-W-based ODS alloys easily deviate from the gamma/gamma' two-phase region, leading to the existence of Al (x) Co, Co3W, Co7W6, and W phases in addition to the gamma and gamma' phases. Nonuniform distribution of alloying elements brings about the differences in morphologies and sizes of gamma' precipitates. Microstructural formation process is impelled by spinodal decomposition mode, and spinodal decomposition behavior has been accelerated in the fine-grained alloy because of the presence of short-circuited diffusion paths for atomic movement.

AB Influence of high Co addition, i.e. 15-30 wt%, on the compressive yield strength of a Ni-base disk superalloy (U720Li) has been investigated from room temperature to 1000 degrees C. It is found that Co addition has no obvious effect on the yield strength below 650 degrees C, but significantly increases the yield strength at 650-800 degrees C if Co content is below 25 wt%. The microstructure observations indicate that high Co addition up to 30 wt% has no significant effect on the phase constituent, but affects the size of secondary gamma'. The deformation mechanisms are discussed according to a newly developed model. It is suggested that high Co addition induces the transition of deformation mechanisms from dislocation pairs cutting to SF shearing anchor deformation twinning, which may be responsible for the enhanced strength at intermediate temperatures.

TI Microstructure and mechanical properties of gamma ' strengthened
   Co-Ni-Al-W-base ODS alloys
SO MATERIALS CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
AB gamma ' precipitates strengthened Co-Ni-Al-W-base ODS alloys, produced by mechanical alloying, are promising high-temperature structural materials. The alloys were found to be composed of gamma/gamma ' two-phase region and discontinuously formed area. The element Ni was effective in enhancing the solubility limit of Al and W within gamma matrix, thus promoting the precipitation of gamma ' phase and restricting the formation of secondary phases, such as Co7W6, Co3W, and AlxCo phases. The flow stress of the alloys was effectively enhanced by the addition of Ni. The peak stress has decreased with increasing deformation temperature. The improved low-temperature strength was mainly attributed to the pining effect of oxide dispersion, gamma ' precipitates and fine-grained structure. The sharp fall in the yield strength in the temperature range of 600-700 degrees C was ascribed to grain boundary sliding, diffusion-controlled void formation, and the formation of shear band.

TI Cyclic Oxidation Behavior of an EB-PVD CoCrAlY Coating Influenced by
   Substrate/coating Interdiffusion
SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF AERONAUTICS
AB To reveal the influence of substrate/coating interdiffusion on the cyclic oxidation property of a metallic coating, cyclic oxidation behavior of an EB-PVD CoCrAlY coating on directionally solidified Ni-based superalloy DZ125 at 1 050 degrees C is investigated. The 40 mu m thick CoCrAlY coating has a cyclic oxidation life of around 160 h, and the oxidation constant is 1.915x10(-7) mg(4).cm(-8).s(-1). However, severe spallation of the oxides containing Co, Cr, Ni, Ta and Ti occurs with longer cyclic oxidation. The degradation in oxidation resistance for the coating is related to the depletion of Al due to the oxide spallation and interdiffusion. Severe interdiffusion between the coating and underlying substrate occurs at 1 050 degrees C. The composition of the substrate has an important effect on the thermal cycling lifetime of the coating. The influencing mechanism is discussed.

TI Primary MC decomposition and its effects on the rupture behaviors in
   hot-corrosion resistant Ni-based superalloy K444
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB The mechanism of primary MC decomposition and its influence on the rupture behaviors in the hot-corrosion resistant superalloy K444 are investigated by the combination of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results reveal that the blocky primary MC mainly distributes at interdendritic regions and grain boundaries after the standard heat treatment. During long-term thermal exposure, primary MC decomposes gradually, which can be summarized into three stages. Firstly, the primary MC reacts with the gamma matrix and produces the M23C6 particles and gamma' film, which can be described as MC + gamma -> M23C6 + gamma'. In the second stage, the un-decomposed primary MC arrests the Ni element and forms the M6C particles and eta phase, which can be expressed as MC + gamma -> M6C + eta. In the third stage, the remaining primary MC reacts with the diffused Ni element and forms the eta phase with M6C and M23C6 particles inside, which can be described as MC + gamma -> M6C + M23C6 + eta. The reaction of the second and third stages should be ascribed to the high (Ti + Nb + Hf)/Al ratio and segregated W, Mo and Cr element in the decomposed region. In addition, the platelet-like sigma phase is found in the third stage. The primary MC decomposition has different effects on the rupture behaviors between tensile and stress-rupture test.

TI Oxidation Behavior of Modified Low Thermal Expansion Thermo-Span
   Superalloy at 650 degrees C
SO RARE METAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING
AB Modified Thermo-Span superalloys of low thermal expansion have high comprehensive tensile and low thermal expansion coefficient. Compare to standard alloy, their Cr element content was decreased and Al element was increased. By means of thermogravimetry (TG), scanning electron microscopy equipped with electron probe (EPMA), the distribution of trace element B in Thermo-Span alloy and its influence on oxidation behavior at 650 degrees C for 100 h have been investigated. The results show that B element in modified Thermo-Span alloy can accelerate precipitation on grain boundaries, and boride precipitation in grain boundaries. The oxidization behavior follows the parabolic curve rule. During the oxidation process, Fe and Co diffuse from the matrix to the outside oxidation layer, and Al, Cr and Ti diffuse from the transition layer towards the matrix. Fe, Co and 0 elements enrich on surface oxidation layer, which forms oxides of Fe and Co, and oxides of Fe in standard alloy. At the same time, Al and Cr are leaning to enrich in the layer between the surface layer and matrix, and there is no Fe and Co element in this middle layer. Boride resists the diffusion of iron from the matrix to the oxidation layer, decreasing the Fe element diffuses outside, the surface oxides of Fe decreasing, and forming the oxides of Fe and Co, hence decreasing the oxide rate of modification Thermo-Span alloy at 650 degrees C for 100 h, and increasing its oxidation resistance.

TI Isothermal Oxidation Behavior Characteristics of a Second Generation
   Ni-base Single Crystal Superalloy in Air at 1000 and 1100 degrees C
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTROCHEMICAL SCIENCE
AB The isothermal oxidation behavior of a second generation Ni-base single crystal superalloy was investigated in air at 1000 degrees C and 1100 degrees C. The microstructures of the oxide morphology and the cross-section area of the specimens after oxidation were analyzed by XRD and SEM/EDX. Indeed, the present results indicated that the Ni-base single crystal superalloy denoted the parabolic oxidation kinetics, which are primarily controlled by the growth of the inner alpha-Al2O3 layer. In conclusion, the scales formed on the surface of superalloy both at 1000 degrees C and 1100 degrees C were complex and can be classified into three different layers in general: an outer layer of NiO with a small amount of CoO, an intermediate layer which predominantly composed of spinels (Ni,Co) Al2O4, NiCr2O4, and accompanied with some other oxides such as CrTaO4, NiTiO3 as well as W20O58, and an inner continuous layer of alpha-Al2O3. Nevertheless, the poor Al zone was appeared between the oxide scales and the substrate after oxidation 200 h and 500 h both at 1000 degrees C and 1100 degrees C.

AB Lattice strain evolution is measured by neutron diffractrometry during tensile testing of a high volume fraction polycrystal nickel superalloy. The intergranular strains reveal anisotropic deformation, with the {200} plane being least stiff and the {111} being the stiffest. Initial plasticity is due to yielding of the {220}. Deconvolution of the {200} and {220} doublets reveals co-deformation of gamma and gamma' phases during plasticity. Comparisons are drawn with low and medium volume fraction superalloys.

TI Fatigue crack growth behavior of a newly developed Ni-Co-base superalloy
   TMW-2 at elevated temperatures
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB Fatigue crack growth (FCG) rates of a new superalloy TMW-2 in air was studied by a fracture mechanics test method. Compact tension specimens were tested under load control with a triangular wave form to investigate the effects of temperature (400, 650, and 725 degrees C) and load ratio (0.05 and 0.5) on FCG rates. The results showed that the FCG rates increased significantly with increasing the temperature. Compared with the creep effects, the results showed that the degradation of mechanical properties and the oxidation assisted crack growth may dominate the FCG rates of TMW-2 at elevated temperatures. Load ratio had a little (at 400 degrees C) or moderate (at 650 and 725 degrees C) influence on the FCG rates, which increased as the load ratio increased. The load ratio effects were successfully accounted for by applying the Walker model. The fractographic observations showed that the fracture mode was transgranular at 400 degrees C and was mixed transgranular and intergranular at 650 and 725 degrees C. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

SO MATERIALS LETTERS
AB Applying fluxing method, hypercooling was achieved in Co80Pd20 alloys. The microstructures and substructures of the as-solidified hypercooled Co80Pd20 alloys subjected to rapid quenching and natural cooling were investigated. Compared to the naturally cooled specimens showing typical microstructural characteristics of recrystallization, high densities of low-angle grain boundaries, dislocations and stacking faults were observed in the quenched specimens. These sub-structures suggest a partial recrystallization occurring in the quenched specimens and are believed as the evidence of recrystallization mechanism of grain refinement in hypercooled Co80Pd20 alloys. The relatively defect-free structure and the high-angle boundaries suggest a relatively sufficient recrystallization in the naturally cooled alloys. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Solidification and Segregation Behavior of Cast Ni-Base Superalloy IN792
SO RARE METAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING
AB The solidification process of cast Ni-base superalloy IN792 was comparatively investigated by differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) and isothermal solidification quenching (ISQ) experiment. The distribution characteristics of elements in solidified solid and residual liquid at different temperatures were also concerned. The isothermal solidification microstructure, the phase precipitation diagram, the solidification characteristic curve and the segregation behavior of elements at different temperatures in liquidus and solidus range were obtained. The results of ISQ indicate that the IN792 alloy possesses a liquidus temperature of 1328 degrees C. The onset of MC carbides and eutectic (gamma+gamma') formation take place at 1310 and 1225 degrees C, respectively. The secondary gamma' is precipitated at 1190 degrees C. The macro-solidus temperature determined by DSC was 1250 degrees C. The volume fraction of residual liquid at this temperature can reach about 5%. The end of the solidification happened at 1180 degrees C, designated as micro-solidus temperature. No liquid remained at this temperature. There is a 70 degrees C gap between macro and micro-solidus temperature. The hot tearing tends to occur in this temperature range. About 85 vol% solid phase was formed within a range of 30 degrees C below the liquidus temperature. In 1300 similar to 1270 degrees C range, the residual liquid in the interdendritic region changed from connected channels to the isolated micro-liquid pools, which is related to the formation of micro-porosity defect. The distribution coefficient of element W and Co are more than 1, indicating that they tend to distribute in solid phase in dendritic region, which are negative segregation elements. The distribution coefficients of element Zr, Mo, Ti, Ta and Cr are less than 1, indicating that they tend to distribute in liquid phase in interdendritic region, which are positive segregation elements. The element Al tends to distribute to liquid phase at the beginning of the solidification, and then be prone to concentrate in the solid phase in the dendritic region and transform to a negative segregation element followed by the solidification temperature decreased. The distribution coefficient of element Al and Ni increases but Mo and Cr decreases followed by the solidification temperature decreasing in 1325 similar to 1210 degrees C range. On the contrary, The distribution of element Al and Ni decreases but Mo and Cr increases followed by the solidification temperature decreasing in 1210 similar to 1180 degrees C range.

TI Electrochemical characterisation of novel gamma/gamma '-strengthened
   Co-base superalloys
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB Electrochemical behaviour of a new gamma/gamma'-strengthened Co-base superalloy with the composition Co-9Al-9W-0.12B (in at%) was studied in comparison with pure Co at room temperature in 1 M Na2SO4 (pH 5.9) and 0.1 M NaOH (pH 12.8) aqueous solutions. Pure Co and the Co-base superalloy show passive behaviour in both solutions. Impedance spectra measured at the corrosion potential indicate comparable impedance values for the alloy and pure Co in neutral solution, but in alkaline solution the alloy shows a lower corrosion rate. Polarisation curves indicate a limited range of passivity for both materials in neutral solution. In alkaline solution, the alloy and pure Co show similar (albeit not identical) primary and secondary ranges of passivity, as previously described in the literature for pure Co. Furthermore, lower passive current densities are observed for the superalloy in the primary range of passivity. As the superalloy studied in this work is a promising material for high temperature applications, we moreover compared the corrosion behaviour of oxidised alloy surfaces with the bare alloy surface. For this, isothermal oxidation of the gamma/gamma'-strengthened Co-base superalloy was carried out in air at 800 degrees C and 900 degrees C for 24 h and 500 h. Compared to unoxidised Co-Al-W-B alloys and pure Co samples, the high temperature oxide scales provide orders of magnitude higher protection with good barrier properties in a potential range between -1 and +2V (vs. Ag/AgCl). In general, longer oxidation times and a higher oxidation temperature result in the formation of more protective oxide layers. The protective effect of the high temperature oxide layers is discussed in view of their thickness and chemical composition. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Influence of composition on microstructural parameters of single crystal
   nickel-base superalloys
SO MATERIALS CHARACTERIZATION
AB Fourteen nickel-base superalloy single crystals containing a range of chromium (Cr), cobalt (Co), molybdenum (Mo), and rhenium (Re) levels, and fixed amounts of aluminum (Al) and tantalum (Ta), were examined to determine the effect of bulk composition on basic microstructural parameters, including gamma' solvus, gamma' volume fraction, topologically close-packed (TCP) phases, gamma and gamma' phase chemistries, and gamma-gamma' lattice mismatch. Regression models describing the influence of bulk alloy composition on each of the microstructural parameters were developed and compared to predictions by a commercially-available software tool that used computational thermodynamics Co produced the largest change in gamma' solvus over the wide compositional range explored and Mo produced the biggest effect on the gamma lattice parameter over its range, although Re had a very potent influence on all naicrostructural parameters investigated. Changing the Cr, Co, Mo, and Re contents in the bulk alloy had an impact on their concentrations in they gamma matrix and to a smaller extent in the gamma' phase. The software tool under-predicted gamma' solvus temperatures and gamma' volume fractions, and over-predicted TCP phase volume fractions at 982 degrees C. However, the statistical regression models provided excellent estimations of the microstructural parameters and demonstrated the usefulness of such fummlas. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

TI Creep properties of different gamma '-strengthened Co-base superalloys

   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB The influence of various alloying elements on the creep properties of polycrystalline Co-base superalloys hardened by a ternary L1(2) compound, Co-3(Al,W) (gamma'-phase), was investigated. A Ti containing quaternary alloy shows creep strength similar to Ni-base superalloys IN100 and IN713C at 850 degrees C and strongly superior to conventional Co-base superalloys as Haynes188. The activation energy for creep between 850 and 950 degrees C is similar to the polycrystalline Ni-base superalloy IN100 in the same temperature range. Strengthening of the grain boundaries by third phase precipitates was found to be crucial for the mechanical properties. This can be achieved either by precipitation of borides or by additional intermetallic phases which precipitate due to oversaturation. During compressive creep at 850 degrees C only a slight tendency for directional coarsening occurs, while at 950 degrees C distinct gamma/gamma'-rafts perpendicular to the external compressive stress axis are formed which indicate a positive lattice misfit even at 950 degrees C.

TI EFFECTS OF Re AND Ru ON MICROSTRUCTURE AND SEGREGATION OF Ni-BASED
   SINGLE-CRYSTAL SUPERALLOYS
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB The influence of Re and Ru on segregation and microstructure evolution during heat treatment has been investigated in four Ni-based single-crystal superalloys with varied contents of Re (3%-6%, mass fractions) and Ru (0% and 3%). The additions of Re and Ru lead to the more severe segregation of alloying elements in as-cast structures. However, the effects of Ru on as-cast segregation can be neglected after the stepwise solution heat treatments. The additions of Re and Ru lead to the lower gamma'-coarsening rate, more cuboidal gamma'-morphology and reduced gamma'-size. Electron microprobe analysis (EPMA) indicates that Al, Ta and Ni partition to the gamma'-precipitates, whereas Re and Cr strongly partition to the gamma-matrix. In comparison to Re and Cr, Ru and W show the less tendency to partition to the gamma-matrix. Additionally, Re increases the supersaturation of Re, Cr, Co and W in the gamma-matrix, whereas Ru only slightly suppresses the partition of these TCP-forming elements to the gamma-matrix.

TI Comparison of O adsorption on Ni3Al (001), (011), and (111) surfaces
   through first-principles calculations
SO PHYSICA B-CONDENSED MATTER
AB First-principles calculations were performed to study the properties of O adsorption on Ni3Al (0 0 1), (0 1 1), and (1 1 1) surfaces using the Cambridge serial total package (CASTEP) code. Stable adsorption sites are identified. The atomic and electronic structures and adsorption energies are predicted. The adsorption sites for O on the Ni3Al (0 0 1) surface are at the 2Ni-2Al fourfold hollow site, whereas O prefers to adsorb at the Ni-Al bridge site on (0 1 1) surface and 2Ni-Al threefold hollow site on (1 1 1) surface. It is found that O shows the strongest affinity for Al and the state of O is the most stabilized when O adsorbs on (0 0 1) surface, while the affinity of O for Al on (0 1 1) surface is weaker than (0 0 1) surface, and (1 1 1) surface is the weakest. The stronger O and Al affinity indicates more stable Al2O3 when oxidized. The experiment has shown that the oxidation resistance of single crystal superalloy in different orientations improves in the order of (1 11), (0 1 1), and (0 0 1) surface, suggesting that the oxidation in different crystallographic orientations may be related to the affinity of O for Al in the surface.

TI STUDY OF OXIDATION BEHAVIOR OF THE GRADIENT NiCrAlY COATING AT 1000 AND
   1100 degrees C
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB MCrAlY(M=Ni and/or Co) overlay coatings are wildly adopted on hot components in gas turbine engines to protect them from rapid oxidation. Various methods can be applied to prepare MCrAlY overlay coatings, which formed by the arc ion plating method possess outstanding properties in terms of interfacial strength, porosity and componential distribution, and thus excellent oxidation properties. To increase the Al content is deemed art economical and effective solution for enhancing the service performance and life for MCrAlY coatings at elevated temperature because the degradation process relies greatly on the ceaseless forming and spallation process of the protective alpha-Al2O3 scales during high-temperature oxidation. However, high content of Al will lower the melting point and decrease the ductility of the coating. This phenomenon can be partly resolved through a gradient coating design. In this paper, a conventional NiCrAlY coating and a gradient NiCrAlY coating have been prepared by the combined method of arc ion plating and subsequent diffusion treatment on Ni-base superalloy substrate. The microstructures, morphologies, isothermal oxidation behavior at 1000 and 1100 degrees C and cyclic oxidation behavior at 1100 degrees C have been investigated on the two kinds of the coatings. The results have revealed that the conventional NiCrAlY coating with uniform components is composed of gamma'/gamma phase, beta-NiAl phase and some alpha-Cr precipitate phase. While the gradient NiCrAlY coating have showed layered microstructure, i.e., an Al-enriched outer layer and a Cr-enriched inner layer, primarily consists of beta-NiAl phase, gamma'/gamma phase and some alpha-Cr precipitate phase in the outer layer. During the oxidation, it is evident that the vanishment of beta-NiAl phase and the enlargement of gamma'/gamma phase for both the coatings. Nevertheless, the gradient coating has maintained higher Al content during long-term oxidation due to the massive beta-NiAl phase obtained in the outer layer after vacuum annealing and the Cr(W) zones precipitated beside the Cr-enriched inner layer during the oxidation. Adequate beta-NiAl phase, as reservoir phase of Al, directly delay the process of Al depletion; Cr(W) zones, to a certain extent, slow down the degradation by hindering the diffusion of Al from the gradient coating to the substrate. As a result, the ability of forming and healing the protective alpha-Al2O3 scales in the gradient coating have been enhanced, which has eventually improved the high-temperature oxidation properties.

TI INFLUENCE OF SEGREGATION ON LIQUID DENSITY IN THE MUSHY ZONE OF DZ483
   Ni-BASED SUPERALLOY
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB Ni-based superalloys have been widely applied in advanced aeroengine as gas turbine blades and vanes. The freckles in superalloys formed during directional solidification have deleterious influence on the properties of the alloys. The generation of freckles is associated with the local liquid density gradient in the mushy zone, which is obviously influenced by microsegregation of alloy elements. However, the individual contributions of the various elements to the total density variation are still not well known. Therefore, the effect of microsegregation on the liquid density variation in DZ483 Ni-based superalloy was investigated by isothermal solidification together with liquid quench method. Solidification microstructures were observed by optical microscope and SEM, and the compositions of the solids and the residual liquid were determined by EDS. Based on the compositions of residual liquids; the densities of liquids at different temperatures were calculated. The results show that the onset solidification temperature of DZ483 alloy is a little bit below 1335 degrees C; and MC, which is enriched with Ta and Ti, formed at about 1325 degrees C. The segregation coefficients of different elements show that W and Co are negative segregation elements, Ta and Ti positive segregation elements, while Al and Cr show little segregation. The density of the residual liquid generally decreases as the decrease of temperature, with the exception that it increases somewhat from 1325 to 1315 degrees C. Calculation results show that temperature has insignificant influence on liquid density, and variation of density is mainly due to rnicrosegregation. Segregations of Mo and Ta lead to the increase of density, but segregations of Ti and W present opposite effect. Contribution of each element to the variation of the liquid density is analyzed. The sequence of contributions of alloy elements to the variation of total liquid density is Ti>Ta>W>Cr>Mo>Al>Co. The formation of MC consumes an abundant of Ti and Ta, resulting in the increase of liquid density from 1325 to 1315 degrees C.

TI OPTIMIZATION OF THE MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF THE SUPERALLOY NIMONIC 80A
SO MATERIALI IN TEHNOLOGIJE
AB The superalloy Nimonic 80A has found its major application in the production of the parts for the vehicle and airplane industries. It is a relatively expensive material and it is very important to reduce its production costs to acceptable levels. The aim of this research was to produce the superalloys with varying supplements of alloying elements.
   The investigations carried out included chemical testing and the testing of the mechanical properties of the superalloy Nimonic 80A, followed by a regression analysis of the obtained data to show the influence of certain alloying elements that can significantly affect the improvement of the mechanical properties of Nimonic 80A.
   The results of the regression analysis are the equations with which, on the basis of the known chemical composition, i.e., the content of the main alloying elements - Al, Ti and Co - the mechanical properties of the materials at increased temperatures can be predicted. On the basis of the obtained squared regression equations, an optimization of the chemical composition for the selected values of the mechanical properties was carried out.

TI Mechanical properties and fracture modes of an advanced Ni-Co-base disk
   superalloy at elevated temperatures
SO MATERIALS CHARACTERIZATION
AB The successful development of an advanced cast and wrought disk alloy, TMW-4M3, was initiated in the NEDO program supported by the Japanese government in cooperation with Mitsubishi Materials Corporation. This paper reports the mechanical properties and fracture modes of TMW-4M3 disk alloy, in order to support its high temperature uses and to understand prospective failure scenarios. The mechanical properties and fracture modes of tensile, creep, low cycle fatigue, and fatigue crack growth were evaluated up to 760 degrees C on specimens machined from the full-scale pancake-shaped disk. The excellent overall mechanical properties of TMW-4M3 alloy were demonstrated. Fracture modes were compared with different testing conditions and fractographic examinations indicated that the fracture modes shifted with changing test conditions. Surface crack initiation was the main failure mode at elevated temperatures. Crack propagation rate was accelerated above 650 degrees C due primarily to oxidation and degradation of mechanical strength. The results indicated that the TMW-4M3 alloy has at least 650 degrees C general capabilities and is promising for 700 degrees C or more applications. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Interdiffusion and Growth of the Phases in CoNi/Mo and CoNi/W Systems
SO METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND
   MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Deleterious topological-closed-packed (tcp) phases grow in the interdiffusion zone in turbine blades mainly because of the addition of refractory elements such as Mo and W in the Ni- and Co-based superalloys. CoNi/Mo and CoNi/W diffusion couples are prepared to understand the growth mechanism of the phases in the interdiffusion zone. Instead of determining the main and cross-interdiffusion coefficients following the conventional method, we preferred to determine the average effective interdiffusion coefficients of two elements after fixing the composition of one element more or less the same in the interdiffusion zone. These parameters can be directly related to the growth kinetics of the phases and shed light on the atomic mechanism of diffusion. In both systems, the diffusion rate of elements and the phase layer thickness increased because of the addition of Ni in the solid solution phase, probably because of an increase in driving force. On the other hand, the growth rate of the mu phase and the diffusion coefficient of the species decreased because of the addition of Ni. This indicates the change in defect concentration, which assists diffusion. Further, we revisited the previously published Co-Ni-Mo and Co-Ni-W ternary phase diagrams and compared them with the composition range of the phases developed in the interdiffusion zone. Different composition ranges of the tcp phases are found, and corrected phase diagrams are shown. The outcome of this study will help to optimize the concentration of elements in superalloys to control the growth of the tcp phases.

TI Suzuki segregation in Co-Ni-based superalloy at 973 K: An experimental
   and computational study by phase-field simulation
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB Suzuki segregation in Co-Ni-based superalloys is of longstanding interest. In this study, the development of widely extended stacking fault (SF) ribbons was confirmed in a Co-Ni-based superalloy aged at 973 K after deformation at room temperature, which supports the decrease in stacking fault energy (SFE) due to Suzuki segregation. In addition, the plastic deformation behaviors of Co-Ni-based superalloys with various Nb contents up to 3 wt.% were investigated focusing on the effect of Nb addition on dynamic strain-aging by Suzuki segregation. The negative strain-rate dependence of flow stress due to dynamic strain-aging became more significant with increasing Nb content; however, attempts to detect segregating elements by scanning transmission electron microscopy and energy-dispersive spectroscopy analysis were not successful. A phase-field simulation of Suzuki segregation suggested strong Ni depletion with segregation of Cr and Mo atoms at the SF, and the SFE can become negative as a consequence of the segregation. This agrees with the experimentally observed formation of wide SFs by the aging at 973 K after cold deformation. It is also suggested that Nb atoms are strongly depleted at SFs, and a small amount of Nb addition dramatically enhances Cr segregation, resulting in further decreases in the SFE, which is probably responsible for the observed enhancement of dynamic strain-aging by Nb addition. In addition, the local structural changes, such as short-range ordering and/or an in-plane ordering, accompanying the segregation were discussed as possible additional mechanisms for strain-aging enhancement.

TI Transient liquid phase bonding of FSX-414 superalloy at the standard
   heat treatment condition
SO MATERIALS CHARACTERIZATION
AB The as-cast samples of FSX-414 Co-based superalloy were heat treated at the standard solution and aging heat treatment cycles. Specimens for joining were cut from the as-cast ingot. Transient liquid phase (TLP) bonding was carried out at the standard solution cycle, using MBF-30 interlayer. Also, bonded specimens were homogenized at the standard aging condition.
   The microstructure of the as-cast, heat treated and TLP bonded specimens were studied. These studies showed that the non-uniform distributed carbides of the as-cast specimen were replaced by uniform ones during the heat treatment. Eutectic M23C6 carbides were observed in all specimens. Due to the complete isothermal solidification, no eutectic structure was observed in the bond region of bonded specimens. In the diffusion affected zone (DAZ) of these specimens, some intermetallics of the Co-B system were seen. Line scan EDS analysis across the bonding zone of the homogenized joint showed more uniform distribution of alloying elements in comparison with the unhomogenized joint.
   Hardness profiling across the bonding zone showed that isothermal solidification zone's (ISZ) hardness in the homogenized specimen is closer to the base metal (BM) hardness in comparison with the unhomogenized specimen. A hardness peak was observed in the DAZ region of the both homogenized and unhomogenized joints. Shear strength and shear fracture energy of the homogenized joint were about 93% and 82% those of the base metal, respectively. More fibrous zones and smaller dimples were observed at the homogenized joint's fracture surface, in comparison with the unhomogenized one. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Comparison of oxidation resistance of NiCoCrAlTaY-coated and -uncoated
   Mar-M247 superalloys in the air at 1150 degrees C
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Oxidation resistance of NiCoCrAlTaY coated and uncoated Mar-M247 superalloys were compared experimentally in the air at 1150 A degrees C. It was found that the oxidation behavior of the NiCoCrAlTaY coated and uncoated Mar-M247 superalloys generally followed the parabolic kinetics with the rate of 1.5 and 9.8 x 10(-3) mg(2)/cm(4) h for each one. Microstructural observation and elemental analysis indicated that after 200 h the uncoated alloy covered with an oxide scale of 6-10 times thicker than the coated one, beneath which a fairly continuous and relatively thin alpha-Al2O3 could be found along the interface close to the substrate. Comparatively, the NiCoCrAlTaY coated alloy uniformly produced the continuous, dense and thick alpha-Al2O3 layer adhesive to the coating to prevent the metal elements against excessive oxidation, and finally formed the steady oxide scales: outer (Ni, Co)(Al, Cr)(2)O-4 spinels, NiO, (Al, Cr)(2)Ni-3; inner protective alpha-Al2O3 with a little Cr2O3. On the surface of the uncoated alloy, however, it mainly formed the Ni-rich oxides in which a large quantity of cracks propagated to result in the more oxidation.

TI PARTITION OF Hf AMONG THE PHASES AND ITS EFFECTS ON PRECIPITATES IN PM
   Ni-BASED SUPERALLOY FGH97
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB The partition behavior of hafnium among different phases in FGH97 PM (powder metallurgy) superalloy and its effects on the precipitation behaviors of MC carbide and gamma' phase were studied by means of 3DAP, SEM, TEM and physiochemical phase analysis. The results showed that element Hf mainly exists in gamma' phase and MC carbide, which makes gamma' composition transform to (Ni,Co)(3)(Al, Ti, Nb, Hf), also makes MC transform to (Nb, Ti, Hf)C. With Hf addition increasing, the proportion of Hf in gamma' maintains constant, but in MC carbide increases and in gamma decreases, which means that partition ratio (R-1) between gamma' phase and MC carbide is decreased, while partition ratio (R-2) between gamma' phase and gamma matrix is increased, the average partition ratio between gamma' phase and MC carbide is about 1 : 0.1, and the average partition ratio between gamma' phase and gamma matrix is about 1 : 0.05. Hf is helpful to the precipitations of gamma' phase and MC carbide, the morphology and size of gamma' phase are influenced more by Hf than these of MC carbide.

TI Alloying element additions to Ni3Al: Site preferences and effects on
   elastic properties from first-principles calculations
SO COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB First-principles calculations were performed to study the effects of alloying elements (Mo, Re, Ta, W, Ti, Co, Nb, Ru, Cr, Y) on the elastic properties of Ni3Al. The site preferences of the alloying elements in Ni3Al at different temperature and concentrations were predicted. The influence of alloying elements on the lattice parameters of Ni3Al were calculated and compared with the values fitted from experimental data. The effects of alloying elements on the elastic constants of Ni3Al were present. The directional shear and Young's moduli for single-crystal Ni3Al alloys with alloying elements were estimated. The bulk, shear, and Young's moduli of polycrystalline alloys were obtained. It is found that all the alloying elements occupy Al sites except Ru and Co, which may occupy both sites depending on concentration and temperature. All the elements increase shear and Young's moduli of single-crystal Ni3Al in all orientations except Cr, Co and Y. All the elements increase both bulk and shear moduli of polycrystalline Ni3Al except Co and Y. The solute atoms with higher bulk modulus tend higher bulk modulus of Ni3Al alloys, and the bulk modulus is related to the mole volume either. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Hot deformation behavior of Co-base ODS alloys
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Co-base ODS alloys, strengthened by nanosized oxide dispersion and gamma' precipitates, were prepared by mechanical alloying. Hot compression tests were performed in the temperature range of 25-970 degrees C with the strain rate varying from 0.0001 to 0.01 s(-1). The influence of deformation parameters and Y2O3 content on the flow behavior and the microstructure of compressive specimens were investigated. It was observed that Co-base ODS alloys had exhibited the homogeneous distribution of ultrafine gamma' precipitates (0.26 mu m), nanosized oxide particle (12.5 nm), and small grains (1.1 mu m). The enhanced flow stress at low temperatures and high strain rates was attributed to the rapid multiplication of dislocations due to the pining effect of oxide dispersion, gamma' precipitates, and fine grains. The peak stress had decreased with increasing the deformation temperature as well as by decreasing the strain rate. The obvious improvement in flow stress was acquired by increasing the Y2O3 contents. Grain boundary sliding and porosity growth had been considered to be the main softening mechanisms during the hot deformation at elevated temperature. Moreover, It was found that the flow softening could be accelerated by decreasing the strain rate. The activation energy had increased with increasing temperature, but decreased with decreasing strain rate. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB The mechanical behavior of Co-20Cr-15W-10Ni alloy is studied by compression tests at high temperature. Microstructures after deformation are evaluated using SEM-EBSD. Significant grain refinement occurs by dynamic recrystallization for high temperature and low strain rate (T>1100 degrees C, (epsilon) over dot<0.1s(-1)), and at high strain rate ((epsilon) over dot-10s(-1)). Dynamic recrystallization is discontinuous and occurs by grain boundaries nucleation, leading to a necklace structure, The nucleation mechanism is most likely to be bulging of grain boundaries. However, recrystallization occurs also by rotation of annealing twins which can bulge as well The modeling of mechanical behavior gives a fair quantification of flow softening due to dynamic recrystallization, indicating the progress of dynamic recrystallization with deformation.

AB The newly developed TMW (R) disk superalloy exhibits better overall mechanical properties in the intended service temperature region (650-750 degrees C) than the most advanced cast & wrought disk alloy U720Li. Clarification of the underlying mechanisms is beneficial for designing advanced superalloys. Among the TMW alloys, TMW-4M3 has the best tensile strength and creep resistance. In this study, tensile tests of U720Li and TMW-4M3 were conducted at temperatures ranging from 25 degrees C to 750 degrees C. The deformation microstructures have been investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Dislocation activity, involving anti-phase boundary (APB), was the dominant mechanism in U720Li up to 725 degrees C. However, the transition of deformation mechanisms from dislocation pairs cutting to stacking fault (SF) shearing and deformation twinning was observed in TMW-4M3. A concise model related to the increased surface energy is put forward to describe the competing mechanisms. It is found that APB energy, SF energy (SFE), and volume fraction of tertiary gamma' have important influence on the transition of deformation mechanisms. The controlling of deformation mechanism by alloy design is discussed.

AB In advanced industrial gas-turbine systems, there is a great demand for a new, excellent superalloy which can be used for large gas-turbine blades. Because it is very difficult to produce a large-scale Ni-based Single Crystal (SC) blade, we have developed new Directionally Solidified (DS) superalloys with an excellent combination of high-temperature creep strength, low-cycle-fatigue strength, good oxidation resistance, castability and hot-corrosion resistance. In this study, three kinds of Ni-based DS superalloys were designed with the aid of the d-electrons concept. The chemical compositions of these alloys were in the range of 1.4%Ti, 8.2%Cr, 11%Co, (0-1.0)%Ru, 3.6%Ta, 9.2%W, 1.0%Re, 5.2%Al, 1.40%Hf and balanced Ni in weight percent (wt%). Creep rupture tests, hot-corrosion burner-rig tests, low-cyclefatigue tests and oxidation tests were conducted with heat-treated DS specimens of these alloys. Two of the designed alloys showed the same level of creep rupture life as those of the 2nd generation DS superalloys currently in wide use. Oxidation tests at 1313K proved that the oxidation resistance of all the designed alloys was superior to that of all the reference alloys. The results of the hot-corrosion burner-rig tests showed that all the designed alloys had better corrosion resistance than the 2nd generation DS superalloys. As for Low-Cycle-Fatigue (LCF) strength, it was found that even 0.6%Ru addition greatly improved LCF strength, and the 0.6%Ru containing Alloy-B showed better LCF strength than any commercially used reference DS superalloys. A casting test was accomplished in a model bucket of a first stage blade of a 25MW-class gas turbine.
   Alloy-B is potentially a suitable alloy for making gas turbine blades with prolonged lifetimes and low maintenance costs in recent 1500 degrees C-class or even higher class gas turbines for power generation.

AB The influence of several alloying elements on the microstructure and creep properties of polycrystalline Co-base superalloys hardened with the ternary Ll(2) compound, gamma'-Co-3( Al, W), are presented in this work. The stability of the gamma/gamma'-microstructure was investigated by long term aging at temperatures of 750 degrees C and 900 degrees C. High contents of chromium and iron destabilize the gamma/gamma'-microstructure. Additions of nickel widen the gamma/gamma'- two phase field. Discontinuous precipitation is observed only in the iridium-containing alloy during aging. In all other alloys no formation of further intermetallic phases are found even after 1000 hrs aging at 750 degrees C and 900 degrees C. Boron has been added for the formation of grain boundary strengthening intermetallic phases which leads to an adjacent gamma'-depleted zone. Nanoindentation shows that titanium improves its hardness. The creep strength of the studied alloys is sufficiently better than that of commercial carbide hardened polycrystalline Co-base superalloys and already close to gamma'-hardened Ni-base superalloys. An alloy containing 2 at.% titanium exhibited a creep strength comparable with the Ni-base alloy IN 100. The microstructure after creep tests at 950 degrees C showed rafting perpendicular to the compressive load axis, confirming the positive lattice misfit of the alloys at high temperatures which was determined with high energy X-ray diffraction.

AB Multilayered MCrAlY type coatings have the potential to be optimised to protect superalloy components against both corrosion and oxidation simultaneously. In this paper, a dual layered coating (NiCr(Co)AlY on top of a NiCoCrAlY coating) has been aged and the microstructural evolution has been observed and quantified using various electron microscopy based techniques. In addition, the microstructural evolution of the coating has been modelled using a diffusion based model capable of predicting the ageing of multilayer coatings. It is demonstrated that the model is reasonably accurate in predicting both the phase and chemical distributions through the coating system during ageing, and therefore has the potential to be used as a design tool for the improvement of future layered coating systems.

AB High temperature deformation in single crystal Co-Al-W-base gamma-gamma' alloys containing Ti, Ta, and Cr has been investigated. The alloys contain a initial two phase microstructure consisting of ordered (L1(2)) precipitates embedded in a solid-solution FCC matrix, similar to Ni-base alloys. Tension creep tests of single crystal Co-base alloys have been conducted in vacuum at 900 degrees C at stresses between 275 and 379 MPa. Minimum creep rates of these Co-Al-W-base alloys are comparable to commercial Ni-base superalloy Rene N4. Directional coarsening and the formation of W-rich phases are observed during creep. Implications for future design of the Co-base alloys are discussed.

AB A new cast & wrought (C&W) superalloy, designated as TMW-4M3, has been developed on the basis of our innovative concept for applications of turbine disks and other components beyond 700 degrees C. TMW-4M3 contains 25 wt% Co and 6.2 wt% Ti, which are higher than that of commercial disk alloys. Full-scale pancakes with 400 mm in diameter and 50 mm in thickness were manufactured from TMW-4M3 alloy via a process route of triple-melting, billet making and disk forging. The investigations on the microstructure and the mechanical properties including tensile strength, creep resistance, fatigue strength and resistance to crack propagation of TMW-4M3 indicate that the alloy provides a 100MPa advantage in 0.2% yield strength at 750 degrees C and a 76 degrees C temperature advantage in 0.2%-strain creep performance loaded under 630MPa over Alloy 720Li (U720Li). The alloy maintains its gamma/gamma' two-phase structure exposed at 750 degrees C for up to 5000 hours. The increment of strength at high temperatures is attributed to the precipitation hardening caused by higher volume fraction of the secondary gamma' precipitates and twin boundary strengthening as a result of high density of annealing twins.

AB One type of functionally graded coating system is thermal barrier coating (TBC), where the combination of ceramic and metallic coating is used both to reduce the temperature and to increase oxidation and corrosion resistance of the substrate. TBCs usually consist of the top ceramic coating based on YSZ (ZrO2+Y2O3) and the metallic bond coating of M-CrAlY type, where M means Ni, Co or their appropriate combination. Electron beam physical vapour deposition (EB-PVD) or vacuum (VPS), low pressure (LPPS) or atmospheric (APS) plasma spraying techniques are most frequently used as a deposition method. Despite some requirements on the product shape simplicity, the air plasma spraying offers high productivity, sufficient quality and much lower production costs in comparison with the EB-PVD technology. The contribution deals with high temperature structural stability of TBCs of YSZ + NiCrAlY and YSZ + CoNiCrAlY types that were produced by air plasma spraying on the INCONEL 713LC polycrystalline nickel based superalloy substrate. Immediately after deposition, the specimens were exposed to temperature of 1000 C for 5-500 hours in the common ambient atmosphere. The changes in both microstructure and chemical composition were studied by means of scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive microanalysis and image analysis methods.

AB Degradation by high temperature oxidation and hot corrosion is the main failure mode of components in the hot section of gas turbines, boilers, industrial waste incinerators, metallurgical furnaces and petrochemical installations. Corrosive environment is because of the usage of wide range of fuel containing large amount of Cl and S together with the volatile alkali metals such as K and Na which leads to the degradation of material. To obviate this problem, superalloy Superco 605 has been studied in air as well as in molten salt environment at 900 degrees C for 100 cycles. Weight change measurements were taken by a digital electronic weighing balance having accuracy of 1 mg after each cycle (heating at 900 degrees C for 1 hour. and subsequently cooling in air for 20 min.) which was used to determine the kinetics of corrosion. The oxide scales formed on the surface of the superalloy were characterized by various techniques such as FESEM, EDAX and XRD. It was found that superco 605 shows good oxidation resistance in air at 900 degrees C but poor corrosion resistance in simulated incinerator environment.

AB Compression tests are carried out at high-temperature on Thermec-master Z, followed by gas quench. Microstructures after deformation are evaluated using SEM-EBSD. Significant grain refinement occurs by dynamic recrystallization for high temperature and low strain rate (T>1100 degrees C, SR<0.1s(-1)), and at high strain rate (SR similar to 10s(-1)). Dynamic recrystallization is discontinuous and takes place from the grain boundaries, leading to a necklace structure. The nucleation mechanism is most likely to be bulging of grain boundaries. However, recrystallization occurs also by rotation of annealing twins. Thereafter the twin boundaries can bulge as well. The modeling of mechanical behavior gives a fair quantification of flow softening due to dynamic recrystallization indicating the progress of dynamic recrystallization with deformation.

AB Nb is one of the common refractory elements added in Ni, Co and Fe based superalloys. This lead to the formation of brittle topological close packed (tcp) mu phase, which is deleterious to the structure. It mainly grows by interdiffusion and in the present article, the interdiffusion process in different Nb-X (X=Ni, Co, Fe) systems is discussed. The activation energy for interdiffusion is lower in the Co-Nb system (173 kJ/mol) than Fe-Nb system (233 kJ/mol), which is again lower than the value found in the Ni-Nb system (319.7 kJ/mol). The mole fraction of Nb in this phase is less than Fe or Co at stoichiometric compositions in the Nb-Fe (that is Fe7Nb6) and Nb-Co (that is Co7Nb6) systems. On the other hand, the mole fraction of Nb is higher than Ni in the same phase (Ni6Nb2) in Ni-Nb system. However, in all the phases, Nb has lower diffusion rate. Possible diffusion mechanism in this phase is discussed with respect to the crystal structure.

AB Young's modulus and damping coefficient measurements performed on various materials by means of dynamic resonant method in free bending mode, exhibit transient effects during first heating, while there is no obvious structural evolution. It has been more particularly observed on sintered and rolled bulk materials as well as coated materials. It can be indubitably related to the release of internal stresses introduced during elaboration.
   The measurement of the resonance frequency shift associated to this release and the development of a model of beam vibration integrating the presence of internal stresses allow the estimation of the initial level of internal stresses. The mechanical model comes from the application of Hamilton principle minimizing potential and kinetic energies described by the Lagrangian of the vibrating system. Then, the effect of internal stresses is introduced, based on a model of pre-stressed vibrating beam found in literature.
   Three experimental illustrations are given: a HIP (high isostatic pressure) sintered MAX phase with compression internal stresses, a 70% rolled Co base steel with very high elastic limit and anisotropic plane tension stresses and a platinum aluminide coating deposited on AM I superalloy.

The kinetics curves of the oxidation were measured by thermal gravimtric analysis (TGA), and the microstructure and the elements distribution in the different regions of the specimens after oxidation were analysed by XRD and SEM/EDAX. The experimental results showed that the oxidation rate in the primary stage was high, then the mass gaining rate decreased gradually with the oxidation time, and the oxidation kinetics obeys parabolic law. A small amount of oxide scale spallation happened during the oxidation at 950 degrees C. The analysis of the specimens after oxidized at 950 degrees C revealed that three oxide layers formed, including the outer layer consisting of TiO2 and CrTiO3, the middle layer consisting of Cr2O3, Ni(Cr2O4) and TiO2 phases, and internal oxidizing layers identified as Al2O3 phase (C) 2011 Published Elsevier Ltd.

AB The effects of alloy elements on the precipitation behaviours of TCP and gamma' phases in new type powder metallurgy (P/M) turbine disk superalloy Rene104 at the aging temperature of 815 degrees C were studied systematically by a thermodynamic calculation method. The chemical compositions of new type nickel-based P/M superalloy were designed combining with d-electron theory. The results show that the contents of Cr, Co, Mo and W mainly influence the precipitation temperature and amount of TCP and gamma' phases in Rene104. The suggested contents of Cr and Co are 13% and 20.6% respectively, and the suggested content of Mo is higher than W. The results also show that the content ratios of Al/Ti and Nb/Ta affect the precipitation behaviours of TCP and gamma' phases. The balance values of Al/Ti and Nb/Ta are suggested in order to make the alloy having desired microstructural stability and strengthening effect. In addition, Hf also influenced the precipitation behaviours of TCP and gamma' phases and the suggested content of Hf is 0.2%. The main precipitates of the new type P/M turbine disk superalloy FGH98I are gamma', MC, M23C6 and M3B2, and no any TCP phases precipitate. After the exposure at 750 degrees C, 815 degrees C and 850 degrees C for 1000 h, the new alloy still shows good microstructural stability.(C) 2011 Published Elsevier Ltd.

The thermal corrosion tests, including Isothermal and cycle oxidation, were conducted for the specimens of the base alloy and the alloy with coatings. The experimental results showed that the thermal spraying NiCoCrAlTaY bond coating improved the thermal corrosion resistance of the alloy significantly. It has been found that the base alloy had high weight gain of 68.91 g/m(2) at the test condition of 1100 degrees C for 100 hrs, while the weightl gain of the specimens of the alloy with NiCoCrAlTaY bond coating, was only 0.76 similar to 5.72 g/m(2). And the slight weight loss appeared when the specimen with with NiCoCrAlTaY bond coating was treated for 40 hrs at1100 degrees C The results also showed that the addition of tantalum element in the coating was beneficial for the thermal oxidation resistance. It has been found that after oxidation at 1100 degrees C for 100 hrs, the continued Al2O3 film nuderneath the outside layer mixture oxides of Cr, Ni, Al and Co, was formed on the substrate surface after both the isothermal oxidation and cycling oxidation. The coating has a good combination with the nickel base superalloy substrate. (C) 2011 Published Elsevier Ltd.

AB Co-based ODS alloys strengthened by gamma' precipitates and nanosized oxides are promising high-temperature structural materials. Single solid solution of Al and W in the matrix can not be achieved after mechanical alloying, resulting in the formation of low volume fraction of gamma' phase and several kinds of secondary phases. The addition of Ni promotes the precipitation of gamma' phase and reduces the amount of secondary phases by the enlargement of the solid solution limit of Al and W within the matrix. In comparison with the lower fracture strength and cleavage fracture mode of the alloy without the addition of Ni, Ni-containing Co-base ODS alloys exhibit much higher fracture strength and obvious ductile facture mode.

SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Selective laser melting (SLM) and electron beam melting (EBM) are relatively new rapid, additive manufacturing technologies which can allow for the fabrication of complex, multi-functional metal or alloy monoliths by CAD-directed, selective melting of precursor powder beds. By altering the beam parameters and scan strategies, new and unusual, even non-equilibrium microstructures can be produced; including controlled microstructural architectures which ideally extend the contemporary materials science and engineering paradigm relating structure-properties-processing-performance. In this study, comparative examples for SLM and EBM fabricated components from pre-alloyed, atomized precursor powders are presented. These include Cu, Ti-6Al-4V, alloy 625 (a Ni-base superalloy), a Co-base superalloy, and 17-4 PH stainless steel. These systems are characterized by optical metallography, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction.

SO SCRIPTA MATERIALIA
AB High-melting-point Co-Re-base alloys show promise as a new class of high-temperature material. However, polycrystalline alloys fracture intergranularly. The addition of boron changes the fracture mode and dramatically improves the strength and ductility. Cr(2)B-type borides form at grain boundaries even with 200 ppm B addition in a Co-17Re-23Cr alloy. Borides are not, however, present at all grain boundaries, and electron energy loss spectroscopy could not detect elemental B segregation at grain boundaries. Measurements of boron mapping by neutron-induced radiography indicates that segregation of B to grain boundaries occurs, though only in some Co-Re alloy compositions. (C) 2011 Acta Materialia Inc.

TI The development of new bond coat compositions for thermal barrier
   coating systems operating under industrial gas turbine conditions
SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB Environmental and economic issues are driving the development of increasingly efficient gas turbines. An important step in achieving this is to engineer components which can operate with longer lifetimes and at higher metal temperatures. Inlet temperatures for gas turbines now exceed the melting temperatures of nickel-based superalloys (i.e. 1300-1350 degrees C). The use of advanced air cooling systems coupled with thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) reduces the temperature of the underlying superalloy substrate. The bond coating, an important part of the TBC system, oxidizes to form a slow growing protective oxide layer, while also providing adhesion between the ceramic topcoat and the substrate. NiCoCrAlY overlay coatings are some of the most commonly used bond coatings for industrial gas turbines and extensive research has been undertaken over many years to find the best bond coating composition.
   This paper reports upon the production of new, model bond coatings with a wide range of different compositions. The focus is on their oxidation behavior at a temperature typically experienced by bond coatings on industrial turbine blades (950 degrees C). A physical vapor deposition technique, magnetron sputtering, has been used to deposit a range of Ni-Co-Cr-Al coatings onto 10 mm diameter sapphire substrates. This was achieved through co-sputtering two targets: a Ni-10%Cr, Ni-20%Cr, Ni-50%Cr, Ni-20%Co-40%Cr or Ni-40%Co-20%Cr target and a pure Al target. About a hundred samples with varying compositions were produced by this method. The coatings were then oxidized in air for 500 h at 950 degrees C.
   All samples were assessed by measuring the change in coating thickness, using pre- and post-exposure metrology only, and also the change in specimen weight. This approach has shown that magnetron sputtering successfully deposited 20 to 30 mu m thick coatings and allowed the calculation of oxide growth rates. Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis was used to characterize the exact composition of each sample. Additionally, Xray diffraction (XRD) has been used to identify the major oxides formed during exposure. The selective growth of protective Cr2O3 or Al2O3 or other less protective mixed oxides (depending on the initial coating composition) was observed.

TI Fatigue crack growth characteristics of a new Ni-Co-base superalloy
   TMW-4M3: effects of temperature and load ratio
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB The fatigue crack growth (FCG) behavior of a newly developed Ni-Co-base superalloy TMW-4M3 has been investigated in this study. Experiment was carried out in laboratory air with compact-tension specimen. The effects of temperature (400, 650, and 725 degrees C) and load ratio (0.05 and 0.5) on crack growth rate were studied in the Paris regime. The results revealed that the crack growth rate increased with increasing temperature under a given load ratio. The influence of load ratio on crack growth rate was pronounced, especially at higher temperature and low stress intensity factor range. Fractographic observations showed that fracture mode was transgranular at 400 degrees C, mixed transgranular and intergranular at 650 degrees C, and predominantly intergranular at 725 degrees C. The possible explanations for the crack growth behavior were discussed based on the degradation of mechanical properties and the oxidation assisted crack growth, as well as the crack closure effect. A comparison of FCG rate was also made between TMW-4M3 and the commercial superalloy U720Li.

SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB The effects of Co and Ti additions on the microstructures and compressive strength of the Ni-based superalloy Udiemt710 (U710) were investigated. The preliminary results showed that the Ni(3)Ti-type (eta) phase was observed in the alloys with low Co and Ti content; while a (Ni(x)Co(1-x))(3)Ti phase with a hexagonal structure was detected in the alloys with high Co and Ti content. The gamma ' ->eta ->( Ni(x)Co(1-0))(3)Ti phase transformation was discussed in terms of Co and Ti contents. The gamma ' morphology changed from spherical to cuboidal with increasing Co and Ti content. Compressive tests showed that the alloys with Co and Ti addition possessed higher yield strength than the base alloy, U710. The strength increase could be ascribed to solid-solution strengthening of the gamma and gamma ' phases as a result of the Co and Ti additions, and the higher volume fraction of gamma ' in the new alloys.

SO RARE METAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING
AB The high-temperature oxidation resistance of Co-Al-W alloy, strengthened by a ternary compound gamma'-Co-3(Al, W) phase, was investigated. The kinetic data of mass gain and the cyclic oxidation behavior of the Co-Al-W alloys, including Co-9Al-7.5W (7.5W), Co-9Al-9.8W (9.8W) and Co-9.2Al-10.7W (10.7W), were studied at 800 and 900 degrees C by XRD, SEM and EPMA technologies, and they were compared with a nickel-base Manaurite900 (MAN900) alloy. The results show that the anti-oxidative ability of 9.8W alloy is the best at 800 degrees C among these alloys. But at 900 degrees C the square of mass gain of 7.5W and 9.8W alloys are much greater, while the anti-oxidant property of MAN900 and 10.7W alloys are superior to other alloys. The oxide scales at 800 and 900 degrees C exhibit a multi-layered structure, including an outer layer of Co3O4, an intermediate layer composed of complex oxides of Co, Al and W elements layer, and an internal attacked layer with oxides of Co and Al.

TI Comparative High Temperature Analysis of HVOF-Sprayed and Detonation Gun
   Sprayed Ni-20Cr Coating in Laboratory and Actual Boiler Environments
SO OXIDATION OF METALS
AB High-velocity-oxy-fuel (HVOF) spray and detonation-gun (D-gun) spray techniques were used to deposit Ni-20Cr coatings on a commonly used boiler steel ASTM-SAE 213-T22. The specimens, with and without coating, were subjected to molten salt (Na2SO4-60%V2O5) deposition in a laboratory furnace at 900 A degrees C to determine hot-corrosion resistance. Specimens were also exposed to the superheater zone of a thermal power plant boiler at an average temperature of 700 A degrees C under cyclic conditions to ascertain their erosion-corrosion (E-C) behavior. Mass-change measurements were taken to approximate the kinetics of corrosion and erosion-corrosion. In the case of E-C, the thickness lost data were also taken at the end of the exposure. The exposed specimens were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and field-emission scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive spectroscopy (FE-SEM/EDS). The HVOF-sprayed coating was found to be intact during exposure to both given environments; whereas the D-gun coating showed spallation of its oxide scale during exposure to the molten salt environments. An overall analysis of the results indicated that the HVOF-sprayed Ni-20Cr coating should be a better choice for the given boiler applications.

TI Cycle oxidation behavior of nanostructured Ni60-TiB2 composite coating
   sprayed by HVOF technique
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB Cycle oxidation resistance at 800 degrees C in static air was investigated for a nanostructured Ni60-TiB2 composite coating sprayed by high velocity oxy-fuel (HVOF). For comparison, a Ni60-TiB2 conventional composite coating was also studied. The results indicate that, the oxidation processes of both composite coatings are controlled by diffusion mechanism, and the nanostructured composite coating has better cycle oxidation resistance than that of the conventional composite coating. The reasons for this improvement can be attributed to the formation of the intact SiO2 and Cr2O3 protective layer, and the enhanced adhesion between oxide film and nanostructure coating.

TI Influence of cooling rate on the development of multiple generations of
   gamma ' precipitates in a commercial nickel base superalloy
SO MATERIALS CHARACTERIZATION
AB The compositional and microstructural evolution of different generations of gamma' precipitates during the continuous cooling of a commercial nickel base superalloy, Rene88DT, has been characterized by three dimensional atom probe tomography coupled with energy-filtered transmission electron microscopy studies. After solutionizing in the single gamma phase field, continuous cooling at a very high rate results in a monomodal size distribution of gamma' precipitates with a high nucleation density and non-equilibrium compositions. In contrast, a relatively slower cooling rate (similar to 24 degrees C/min) results in a multi-modal size distribution of gamma' precipitates with he larger first generation primary precipitates exhibiting close to equilibrium composition, along with the smaller scale secondary gamma' precipitates, exhibiting non-equilibrium composition (excess of Co and Cr, depleted in Al and Ti). The composition of the gamma matrix near these precipitates also exhibits similar trends with the composition being closer to equilibrium near the primary precipitates as compared to the secondary precipitates.

TI Effects of cyclic stress and temperature on oxidation damage of a
   nickel-based superalloy
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB Oxidation damage, combined with fatigue, is a concern for nickel-based superalloys utilised as disc rotors in high pressure compressor and turbine of aero-engines. A study has been carried out for a nickel-based alloy RR1000, which includes cyclic experiments at selected temperatures (700-800 degrees C) and microscopy examination using focused ion beam (FIB). The results suggest that the major mechanism of oxidation damage consists of the formation of surface oxide scales and internal micro-voids and oxide particles beneath the oxide scales, which become more severe with the increase of temperature. Applying a cyclic stress does not change the nature of oxidation damage but tends to enhance the extent of oxidation damage for temperatures at 750 degrees C and 800 degrees C. The influence of cyclic stress on oxidation damage appears to be insignificant at 700 degrees C, indicating a combined effect of cyclic stress and temperature. Further energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDXS) analyses show the enrichment of Cr and Ti, together with lower Ni and Co levels, in the surface oxide scales, suggesting the formation of brittle Cr2O3, TiO2, NiO and Co3O4 oxides on the specimen surface. Penetration of oxygen into the material and associated internal oxidation, which leads to further material embrittlement and associated failure, are evidenced from both secondary ion imaging and EDXS analyses.

AB The gamma/gamma' microstructure of a Re-containing Ni-based single crystal super alloy after a two-step aging was studied using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). The crystals were grown by the floating zone (FZ) method. Both cuboidal and spherical gamma' precipitates were formed after a two-step aging. The size of the cuboidal gamma' phases first increased and then decreased with the extension of the second-step aging time. Re, Co and Cr strongly concentrated in the gamma phase whereas Ni and Al enriched in the gamma' phase. Thermodynamic calculation by JMatPro was performed to explain the experimental observations.

TI Thermomechanical Fatigue Damage Evolution in a Superalloy/Thermal
   Barrier System Containing a Circular Through Hole
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CERAMIC SOCIETY
AB The results of an investigation of thermomechanical fatigue (TMF) on a superalloy specimen, with an applied thermal barrier coating (TBC) and a circular through hole, are presented. Tensile loads were applied in phase with increasing temperature. Damage evolution in the form of cracks develops in the TBC adjacent to the hole. These cracks run perpendicular to the loading axis. Stress mapping of the thermally grown oxide (TGO) using luminescence spectroscopy determined an increase in compressive residual stress with increasing TMF cycling. Scanning electron microscopy examination, following cross sectioning, determined the TBC cracks to be vertical separations of the columnar yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) top coat. Microscopic damage mechanisms in the form of plasticity (bending of YSZ columns) and TGO cracking were observed. Imperfections in the bond coat are associated with these vertical separations. Energy-dispersive element mapping of these imperfections indicated a composition of alumina and mixed Cr, Co, and Ni oxides.

TI Effect of heat treatment on mechanical properties of alloy 909
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Alloy 909 is a Ni-Fe-Co alloy that exhibits a low coefficient of thermal expansion and high strength at elevated temperatures. These characteristics are suitable for demanding high temperature uses such as turbine components for aerospace and energy generation. The mechanical properties are achieved by heat treatment (solution and aging) that affects the microstructural characteristics such as grain size and precipitation of intergranular and transgranular particles. This work summarises the results of trials conducted to determine the conditions that assure the desired mechanical properties in high temperature ring rolled pieces. Results of tensile, hardness and stress rupture tests are complemented by microstructural analyses. These studies allowed for establishing a robust method for the manufacture of rings; no degradation of the product, either metallurgical or due to properties, has been reported after the method was implemented.

TI Effect of processing parameters on hot compressive deformation behavior
   of a new Ni-Cr-Co based P/M superalloy
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB The hot compressive deformation behavior of a new Ni-Cr-Co based P/M superalloy was studied in the temperature range of 950-1150 degrees C and strain rate range of 0.0003-1 s(-1) using hot compression tests. The effect of processing parameters on flow stress, activation energy, power dissipation eta maps and instability maps were investigated. The results show that the flow stress decreases with increasing temperature and decreasing strain rate. The apparent activation energy of deformation decreases while the values of eta in the peak zones increase with increasing strain, due to the occurrence of dynamic recrystallization. When the strain is 0.5, a domain with its peak eta of 40% occurs at 1050 degrees C and 0.0003 s(-1), which corresponds to dynamic recrystallization with grain size of ASTM 10-11 and can be as the optimum processing parameters for good workability.

SO INTERMETALLICS
AB Solidification processing of new high-temperature Co-Al-W-base single-crystals has been investigated. Single-crystal bars with compositions of Co-9.4Al-10.7W, Co-8.8Al-9.8W-2Ta and Co-7.8Al-7.8W -1.5Ta-4.5Cr (at%) were successfully grown with a conventional Bridgman process. Helical grain selectors resulted in [001] dendritic growth with primary dendrite arm spacings in the range of 278 -364 mu m. Segregation of constituent elements in the dendritic structure was very limited, compared to Ni-base single-crystals. Concentration profiles obtained by electron microprobe and analyzed via the Scheil equation indicate distribution coefficients for Co, Al, W and Cr that are close to 1. The distribution coefficient of Ta was approximately 0.6, indicating preferential segregation to the liquid during solidification. These observations collectively suggest that convective instabilities and freckle formation are unlikely to occur during solidification of single-crystals of this new class of high strength Co-Al-W-base alloys.

   Temperatures
SO RARE METAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING
AB Co-Al-W alloy is a novel Co-base superalloy, with the precipitation strengthening phase of ternary compound gamma'-Co(3)(Al,W). The kinetic data of oxidation mass gain were measured for the Co-Al-W alloy at 800 and 900 degrees C in air, and the oxidation rate constants at different temperatures were determined by the relevant linear fitting. According to Arrhenius relation of the oxidation rate constants, the activation energy of oxidation was derived for this alloy at 800 and 900 degrees C. It is found that 9W alloy has the highest value of activation energy of oxidation among 7.5W, 9W and 10.7W at different temperatures. The addition of refractory elements Mo, Nb, Ta and Ti can change the mass gain and activation energy of oxidation of the Co-Al-W alloy; therefore, the oxidation resistance of the superalloy at high temperatures can be forecast.

AB The hot compressive deformation behavior of a new hot isostatically pressed Ni-Cr-Co based powder metallurgy (P/M) superalloy was studied in the temperature range of 950-1150 degrees C and strain rate range of 0.0003-1 s(-1) Gleeble-1500 thermal simulator. The dynamic recrystallization-time-temperature (RTT) curve was developed and the constitutive equation of flow stress during hot deformation was established. The results show that the flow stress decreases with increasing deformation temperature and decreasing strain rate. The flow stress represents as the characteristic of dynamic crystallization with the increasing of strain at the deformation temperatures lower than 1100 degrees C and strain rates higher than 0.0003 s(-1). The beginning time of dynamic crystallization has no linear relationship with deformation temperature in the condition of strain rate lower than 0.01 s(-1). Besides, the experiments verify that the hyperbolic sine model including the variable of strain reflects the changing law of flow stress during the hot deformation process.

The optimum hot-working conditions were determined from the processing map based on the dynamic materials model. Dynamic recrystallization was observed to occur over the entire temperature and strain rate range. However, uniformly sized grains were formed for strain rates higher than 1 s(-1), which is considered to be the optimum hot-working condition. In addition, authors suggested that in extremely low stacking fault energy alloy, explosive and homogeneous formation of mechanical twinning should be considered to be stable state, and new processing map with more detailed description of deformation mechanism seems necessary in future.

TI Effect of high undercooling on Co-Ni-Ga ferromagnetic shape memory
   alloys
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Co45Ni25Ga30 ferromagnetic shape memory alloys were treated by glass fluxing combined with superheating cycling. The effect of high undercooling on solidified microstructure and transformation temperatures was investigated. The martensite lath is obviously refined and a mass of sub-grains are produced with the increase of undercooling. Undercooling rapid solidification introduces a number of dislocations and large internal stress, which give rise to the production of sub-grains in recovery. During the following annealing process, these sub-grains can gradually recrystallize and grow up with an amount of gamma' phase precipitated. Meanwhile, transformation temperatures of undercooled alloys are greatly elevated compared with those of as cast, which results from the large internal stress, and gradually reduce with the heating time.

TI Effect of rhenium on solidification and segregation of nickel-based
   superalloy
SO RARE METALS
AB The solidified process of the rhenium-containing nickel-based superalloys was investigated in this paper. The solidified experiments of samples were carried out in a silicon carbon tube furnace with following water quenching. Microstructure of samples and subsequent compositional analysis of solidified ones were determined by an optical microscope (OM) and electronic probe micro analysis (EPMA), respectively. The results show the initial temperature, final temperature and the temperature interval of solidification keep constant with increasing content of Re in alloys under the test conditions, demonstrating the similar solidification sequences. With increasing Re element in alloy, the segregation coefficient of Al, Cr, Co, Mo, and Ta slightly varies, but the segregation coefficient of W obviously decreases.

SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Interdiffusion study of the Co-Nb system is conducted to determine the diffusion parameters in different phases. The integrated diffusion coefficients at different temperatures are calculated for the Nb2Co7 phase, which has very narrow composition range. The interdiffusion coefficients at different compositions in the NbCo2 Laves phase are determined. The interdiffusion coefficient in this phase decreases with increasing Nb content to the stoichiometric composition. Further, the average interdiffusion coefficient in the N6Co7-mu phase is determined. The activation energies for diffusion in different phases are calculated, providing valuable information regarding the diffusion mechanism. In addition, an experiment using Kirkendall markers is conducted to calculate the relative mobilities of the species.

TI Research on Trace Elements-Containing Phases in a New Type Nickel-Based
   P/M Superalloy
SO RARE METAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING
AB The trace elements Hf-, Zr- and Ta-containing phases in the mother alloy, plasma rotating electrode processing (PREP) powders and hot isostatic pressed (HIPed) state of a new third generation nickel-based powder metallurgy (P/M) superalloy were studied. The results show that the trace elements Hf, Zr and Ta mainly exist as MC-type carbides which locate between the dendrites and in the shape of block, strip and butterfly. The carbides in PREP powders can be broadly divided into two groups. One is rich in Ti, Ta and Nb, and the other contains the elements of Ta, Hf and Zr. The two types of carbides both contain a certain amount of non-carbide forming elements Co and Ni, weak carbide forming elements Cr and Mo, and locate between the dendrites or cellulars and in the shape of block and granular. In addition, the analysis of HIPed alloy show that the trace elements Hf, Ta and Zr mainly exist as intragranular and grain boundary MC carbides. All of these indicate that the trace elements Hf, Zr and Ta are in the survival of MC-type carbides and with the genetic characteristic. Carbides and gamma' phase of HIPed alloy contain less Ta compared with PREP powders.

TI Interaction of coal-derived synthesis gas impurities with solid oxide
   fuel cell metallic components
SO JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES
AB Oxidation-resistant alloys find use as interconnect materials, heat exchangers, and gas supply tubing in solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) systems, especially when operated at temperatures below similar to 800 degrees C. If fueled with synthesis gas derived from coal or biomass, such metallic components could be exposed to impurities contained in those fuel sources. In this study, coupons of ferritic stainless steels Crofer 22 APU and SS 441, austenitic nickel-chromium superalloy Inconel 600, and an alumina-forming high nickel alloy alumel were exposed to synthesis gas containing <= 2 ppm phosphorus, arsenic and antimony, and reaction products were tested. Crofer 22 APU coupons coated with a (Mn,Co)(3)O(4) protective layer were also evaluated. Phosphorus was found to be the most reactive. On Crofer 22 APU, the (Mn,Cr)(3)O(4) passivation layer reacted to form an Mn-P-O product, predicted to be manganese phosphate from thermochemical calculations, and Cr(2)O(3). On SS 441, reaction of phosphorus with (Mn,Cr)(3)O(4) led to the formation of manganese phosphate as well as an Fe-P product, predicted from thermochemical calculations to be Fe(3)P. Minimal interactions with antimony or arsenic in synthesis gas were limited to Fe-Sb and Fe-As solid solution formation. Though not intended for use on the anode side, a (Mn,Co)(3)O(4) spinel coating on Crofer 22 APU reacted with phosphorus in synthesis gas to produce products consistent with Mn(3)(PO(4))(2) and Co(2)P. A thin Cr(2)O(3) passivation layer on Inconel 600 did not prevent the formation of nickel phosphides and arsenides and of iron phosphides and arsenides, though no reaction with Cr(2)O(3) was apparent. On alumel, an Al(2)O(3) passivation layer rich in Ni did not prevent the formation of nickel phosphides, arsenides, and antimonides, though no reaction with Al(2)O(3) occurred. This work shows that unprotected metallic components of an SOFC stack and system can provide a sink for P. As and Sb impurities that may be present in fuel gases, and thus complicate experimental studies of impurity interactions with the anode. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Fourth generation superalloys are characterised by the addition of Ru which contributes to improved creep resistance whilst improving the microstructural stability. However, Ru additions have a negative effect on coated Ni-base superalloys, promoting Secondary Reaction Zone (SRZ) formation. Formation of a layer of SRZ beneath an aluminised or Pt-aluminised coating has the potential to reduce the effective cross section of a blade by in excess of 100 gm or 10% of the wall thickness. In this paper the effects of alloy composition on the formation of the SRZ in Pt-Aluminised fourth generation alloys were investigated systematically. A series of experimental fourth generation alloys was used having two distinct compositions of Co, Mo, W and Ru and conforming to a four factorial 'Design of Experiments' model. These alloys showed significant and consistent changes in the SRZ depending on alloy composition. These were in distinct contrast to the effects of these elements on stability in the bulk. Mo was demonstrated to be by far the most effective element suppressing SRZ formation, followed by Co. In contrast, both W and Ru enhance SRZ formation.

CL Wildbad Kreuth, GERMANY
AB Aerospace gas turbine disks operate in an environment of relatively high stresses caused by centrifugal forces and elevated temperatures. Because of the strong mechanical requirements and narrow specifications of such parts not only a correct, defect free final geometry is necessary, but also a defined microstructure. Even though the microstructure evolution during thermo-mechanical processing is well studied and understood for superalloys like IN718, the influences cannot easily be described analytically. Thus simulation tools are used to assure process stability and to optimize design parameters to meet the tough requirements in aerospace industries.
   Microstructure simulation of IN718 (and other materials) is well established at Bohler Schmiedetechnik GmbH & Co KG and appreciated by its customers. The advent of the newly developed nickel-base superalloy ATI Allvac (R) 718Plus (TM) led to extensive investigations and the development of an adapted microstructure model by Bohler Schmiedetechnik GmbH & Co KG and its research partners.
   Aim of this paper is a comparison of the microstructure evolution in IN718 and ATI Allvac (R) 718Plus (TM) during the thermo-mechanical treatment of turbine disks. Influences of process temperature, strain and strain rate on the final grain size are discussed by finite element simulations with a coupled grain structure model. Experimental results from trial forgings are compared with the outcome of the microstructure simulations.

AB Although Ni-base superalloys meet the gas turbine needs of today, they are used very close to their melting range. Demands for applications at higher temperatures are presently met partly through component cooling and application of thermal barrier coatings. However, this approach can not be sustained indefinitely unless the base metal melting temperature is also significantly increased. Rhenium addition can substantially increase the melting point in Co-base alloys and thereby provide a unique opportunity in the development of new alloys for very high temperatures - e.g. for applications at +100 degrees C metal temperature above present day single crystal Ni-base superalloys. The design considerations behind the Co-Re alloy development are presented in this paper. Selected results from the alloy development studies are also presented.

AB The gas turbine components operated in hot combustion gas undergo material degradation due to the thermal cycles. The failure mechanism of the hot gas components would be accompanied by material degradation in the properties of high temperature strength and creep rupture time. Many stationary parts in gas turbine are made of Co-based superalloy because of their high temperature performance. In this work, we survey the time and temperature dependent degradation of Co-based superalloy. We prepared the specimens of Co-based superalloy ECY768 that are exposed at 871 and 982 degrees C in 1000 similar to 5000 hours. We carried out the mechanical test and microstructural observation.

AB Laser cladding has been taken into consideration for repairing K418 Ni-based superalloy material with CoCrNiW powder. Composition of cladding materials was revealed by energy dispersive X-ray spectrum(EDS). The characteristic microstructure of the cladding layer and interface were investigated by using an optical microscope and scanning electron microscope(SEM). Cladding coatings were obtained for different process parameters, and a detailed study of the effects of these parameters has been carried out by SEM. Metallurgical bonding between the cladding layer and substrate materials was obtained. Effect of heat input on cladding cracking susceptibility has been studied to obtain optimum condition for crack-free welds. Variations in cracking susceptibility as a function of heat input is discussed with reference to metallurgical characteristics of the clads. The corresponding microstructure induced by different heat input was discussed in this paper too.

   Microstructures were studied for as-cast, heat treated and TLP bonded specimens. These studies showed that the ununiform distributed carbides of MC type in the as-cast specimens replaced by M(23)C(6) type carbides with uniform distribution in the heat treated microstructure. Due to complete isothermal solidification, no eutectic structure in the bond region wasobserved, but some intermetallics in the diffusion affected zone (DAZ) were observed. Microhardness tests were used to compare the hardness of age hardened specimens with bonded specimens at the same heat treatment condition. Hardness profile also showed a peak in DAZ region in spite of complete isothermal solidification.

The effects of the processing parameters (laser power P, addition amount of WC, scanning speed V) on the microhardness of the deposited coatings was analyzed. Results indicate that the microhardness of the matrix and the Rockwell hardness of the deposited coatings increases with the addition of WC and the P/V value. The addition amount of WC has the most important effect on the two hardness values, followed by the scanning speed and the laser power. Results of the optimized specimen in this study indicate that the deposited coating is composed of undissolved WC, dendrites, eutectics and the coral structures. The wear mechanism of the deposited coating is a mixture of abrasive, adhesive and oxidation wear.

TI STUDY ON PARTITION RATIO AND SEGREGATION BEHAVIOR OF DZ125 ALLOY DURING

SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB Segregation behavior is an important problem in solidification process of alloys, which determines their growth morphologies, phase distributions and concentration segregations so that it affects the mechanical properties of alloys, such as fatigue lives, creep properies, etc.. However, the segregation behaviors of Ni-based superalloys are very complex that contain multi-components and consist of multi-phases. The solute partition coefficient is a key characteristic parameter to express the solute segregation level and tendency in a solidification process. In the present paper, the solute profiles in directionally solidified DZ125 alloy with planar interface growth, which was obtained through experiments of quenching during directional solidification, have been measured by electron probe micro analysis (EPMA). The steady state of solute redistribution hardly reaches due to melt flow during solidification process. The contents of gamma' phase forming elements, Al, Ti, Ta, Mo and Ni, along longitudinal direction increase with the increase of solidified fraction, while those of W, Cr and Co decrease. The results show that the solute partition coefficients of Al, Ti, Ta, Mo and Ni are less than unit, those of W, Cr and Co are more than unit. In addition, the solute distribution in solid phase with dendrite growth is similar to that with planar interface growth. Compared the experimental results of microsegregation with the calculated ones of Scheil model and Brody-Flemings model, the Brody-Flemings model fits better with the experimental results. It indicates that the back-diffusion in solid phase would reduce the microsegregation during dendrite growth.

TI Improvement of the Oxidation Resistance of the Single-Crystal Ni-Based
   TMS-82+Superalloy by Ni-Al Coatings with/without the Diffusion Barrier
SO OXIDATION OF METALS
AB Oxidation behavior of the uncoated base, Ni-Al coated and Re-Cr-Ni plus Ni-Al coated single-crystal (SC) Ni-based TMS-82+ superalloy is studied under cyclic air at 900 degrees C for 200 h to assess the oxidation resistance. Regardless of the coating processing, Ni-Al coating is effective in improving the oxidation resistance due to the formation of a continuous alpha-Al(2)O(3) a layer in the scale. For the uncoated base superalloy, the mass-gain curves are fitted by a subparabolic relationship, and complex oxide products including predominately NiO, some CrTaO(4), alpha-Al(2)O(3), Cr(2)O(3), a minor of spinels of (Ni, Co)Al(2)O(4), AlTaO(4) and theta-Al(2)O(3) are detected. Time-dependence of the oxide growth rate for both coated superalloy with/without the diffusion barrier is explained by the parabolic relationship. The oxide scales consist predominately of alpha-Al(2)O(3) and a minor of theta-Al(2)O(3). The diffusion barrier of sigma-phase plays a negligible effect on the oxidation resistance during

SO SCRIPTA MATERIALIA
AB The influence of W, Ta, Ti, Nb, V, Si, Mo, Ir and Cr on the high temperature properties of gamma/gamma'-strengthened Co-Al-W superalloys was investigated. All alloys exhibited a gamma/gamma' microstructure with remarkably differing gamma' volume fractions. W, Ta, Ti, Nb and V increased the gamma' volume fraction and gamma' solvus temperature. An increased W content and alloying of additional elements, except Ir, decreased the liquidus temperature. First creep experiments revealed a creep strength comparable with polycrystalline Ni-base superalloys and the importance of grain boundary strengthening. (c) 2010 Acta Materialia Inc.

TI A Kinetic Model for Grain Growth in a Polycrystalline Ni-Co Base
   Superalloy with gamma/gamma Two-Phase
SO JOURNAL OF THE JAPAN INSTITUTE OF METALS
AB Grain growth kinetics was studied in a new Ni-Co base disk superalloy with gamma/gamma two-phase structure (TMW-4M3) The alloy was heat-treated from 1100 to 1160 C for up to 100 h after hot-deformation The results indicated that the size of un-dissolved gamma -phase increased with increasing of temperature or time because of Ostwald ripening Meanwhile the grain size of the alloy showed a good agreement with the Zener s pinning model at all tested conditions which means that the grain size can be estimated from the size and the volume fraction of the un-dissolved gamma -phase particles Furthermore assuming that the coarsening behavior of the pinning gamma particles follows Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner (LSW) theory we estimate that the activation energy of the gamma particle growth in TMW-4M3 is 303 +/- 28 kJ/mol (within the gamma sub-solvus temperature range from 1100 to 1150 C) which is close to that of diffusion of Al and Ti atoms in the matrix Therefore we suggest that the grain growth in TMW-4M3 follows the diffusion-controlled growth model of gamma formers in the matrix and the grain growth rate is determined by the coarsening rate of un-dissolved gamma -phase particles

   ASME
AB Both aviation and land based turbine components such as vanes/nozzles, combustion chambers, liners, and transition pieces often degrade and crack in service. Rather than replacing with new components, innovative repairs can help reduce overhaul and maintenance costs. These components are cast from either Co-based solid solution superalloys such as FSX-414, or Ni-based gamma prime precipitation strengthened superalloys such as IN738. The nominal compositions of FSX-414 and IN738 are Co-29.5Cr-10.5Ni-7W-2Fe (max)-0.25C-0.012B and Ni-0.001B-0.17C-8.5Co-16Cr-1.7Mo-3.4Al-2.6W-1.7Ta-2Nb-3.4Ti-0.1Zr, respectively. Diffusion brazing has been used for over 4 decades to repair cracks and degradation on these types of components. Typically, braze materials utilized for component repairs are Ni and Co-based braze fillers containing B and/or Si as melting point depressants. Especially when repairing wide cracks typically found on industrial gas turbine components, these melting point depressants can form brittle intermetallic boride and silicide phases that effect mechanical properties such as low cycle and thermal fatigue. The objective of this work is to investigate and evaluate the use of hypereutectic Ni-Cr-Hf and Ni-Cr-Zr braze filler metals, where the melting point depressant is no longer B, but Hf and/or Zr. Typically, with joint gaps or crack widths less than 0.15 mm, the braze filler metal alone can be utilized. For cracks greater than 0.15 mm, a superalloy powder is mixed with the braze filler metal to enable wide cracks to be successfully braze repaired. As a means of qualifying the diffusion braze repair, both metallurgical and mechanical property evaluations were carried out. The metallurgical evaluation consisted of optical and scanning electron microscopy, and microprobe analysis. The diffusion brazed area consisted of a fine-grained equiaxed structure, with carbide phases, gamma (gamma) dendrites, flower shaped/rosette gamma-gamma' (gamma-gamma prime) eutectic phases and Ni(7)Hf(2), Ni(5)HF, or Ni(5)Zr intermetallic phases dispersed both intergranularly and intragranularly. Hardness tests showed that the Ni-Hf and Ni-Zr intermetallic phase only has a hardness range of 250-400 Hv; whereas, the typical Cr-boride phases have hardness ranges from 800 Hv to 1000 Hv. Therefore, the hardness values of the Ni-Hf and Ni-Zr intermetallic phases are 2.5-3.2 times softer than the Cr-boride intermetallic phases. As a result, the low cycle fatigue (LCF) properties of the wide gap Ni-Cr-Hf and Ni-Cr-Zr brazed joints are superior to those of the Ni-Cr-B braze filler metals. The mechanical property evaluations were tensile tests at both room temperature and elevated temperature, stress rupture tests from 760 degrees C to 1093 degrees C and finally LCF, the latter being one of the most important and severe tests to conduct, since the cracks being repaired are thermal fatigue driven. At the optimum braze thermal cycle, the mechanical test results achieved were a minimum of 80% and sometimes equivalent to that of the base metals properties.

AB MAR-M 302 a Co-base superalloy is currently used for nozzle guide vanes and stator blades in military and commercial aircraft-turbine engines. These components are usually operated at 1073-1273 K. In this study, the uniaxial constant load creep behavior of MAR-M 302 superalloy over temperature range of 1088-1198 K and stress range of 155-321 MPa was investigated. Concerning creep as thermally activated phenomenon, the investigated alloy followed empirical equation (epsilon) over dot = A sigma(n) exp (-Q/RT)with n values ranging mainly from 7 to 10. The mean apparent activation energy was calculated as 525 +/- 29 kJ/mol. The correlation between rupture life and creep characteristics was studied by different prediction methods that are based on the iso-stress lines and those relating the secondary or steady state creep rate to rupture life.

TI Microstructural analysis of creep exposed IN617 alloy
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Ni base alloys such as IN617 are one of the preferred choices for steam turbine components used by fossil fuelled power generation plants. IN617 is a solid solution strengthened Ni based superalloy containing similar to 23%Cr, 12%Co and 9%Mo with low content of precipitation strengthening elements Al, Ti and Nb. In the 'as received' (solution annealed condition), the microstructure consists of primary carbides (M23C6) and occasional TiN particles dispersed in a single phase austenitic matrix. Owing to high temperature exposure and the creep deformation processes that occur in service, evolution of the microstructure occurs. This results in secondary precipitation and precipitate coarsening, both on grain boundaries and intragranularly in areas of high dislocation density. The influence of creep deformation on the solution treated IN617 alloy at an operating condition of 650 degrees C/574 h, with emphasis on the morphology and distribution of carbide/nitride precipitation is discussed. The applied stress was at an intermediate level.

   T-800 Alloy
SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF AERONAUTICS
AB The effects of 4 wt% rhenium (Re) addition on isothermal oxidation behavior of Tribaloy T-800 alloy have been studied at 800 degrees C and 1 000 degrees C in air. At 800 degrees C, T-800 shows nonuniform oxidation between dendritic and eutectic areas. Re addition clearly promotes the nonuniform oxidation, leading to considerably higher mass gains than that of T-800 at this temperature. At 1 000 degrees C exposure, the thickness of scale on T-800 increases significantly, accompanied by severe scale spallation during cooling to room temperature. On the contrary, T-800Re shows a marked decrease of oxide growth rate compared to the linear one of T-800 at 1 000 degrees C. The scale adhesion is also improved with Re addition at this higher temperature. Therefore, the role of Re depends on the exposure temperature. Re addition gives high oxidation rate at 800 degrees C, however, the excellent oxidation resistance is obtained by the addition of Re at a higher temperature of 1 000 degrees C.

The energy-dispersive x-ray (EDX) spectrum of the mu phase suggested a refractory element rich compound comprising the elements Re, W, and Co. Twin domains parallel to (001) were found in the mu phase. The mechanisms of the mu phase and twinning formation were discussed.

AB The laser-aided direct metal deposition technique was used to form Co-285 superalloy (A) and Co-285 + 30 wt pct WC (B) wear-resistant coatings on 1018 mild steel. Microstructure, element distribution, phases, microhardness distribution, and wear properties of the two coatings were investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrometry, scanning transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffractometry (XRD), microhardness testing, and wear testing. Results indicate that both of the coatings had dense structures, as well as a metallurgical bonding with the substrate. In addition, coating B had microcracks and randomly distributed undissolved WC particles in it. Coating A was composed of alpha-Co dendrites, Co3W precipitates, and eutectics, while coating B was composed of undissolved WC, Co-rich dendrites, eutectics, and the W-rich third phases with various shapes. Crack behavior in coating B was also discussed. The average microhardness of the matrix in coating B was 751 HV0.5, which was almost 1.8 times that of coating A (420 HV0.5). Wear results indicate that the wear resistance of coating B was improved by 6.8 times compared with that of coating A. The improvement in wear resistance is believed to be partially due to the undissolved WC and the formation of large numbers of carbides in the matrix working as wear-resistant phases and partially due to the good bonding between the hard phases and the tough matrix.

TI ONE-STEP DEPOSITION AND INTERFACIAL ADHESIVE STRENGTH OF THE MULTILAYER
   SYSTEM WITH A DIFFUSION BARRIER
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB M-Cr-Al-Y (M=Ni and/or Co) coatings with the good comprehensive property among anti-oxidation, anti-corrosion and mechanical properties have been widely used for the protection for the gas turbine components. However, after a long-term thermal exposure to high temperature atmosphere in service, the coatings are rapidly degraded. The main cause is ascribed to the intensive element interdiffusion between the coating and the substrate. To suppress the interdiffusion, addition of a diffusion barrier (DB) is required at the interface of the overlayer and the substrate. However, M-Cr-Al-Y coating system with a ceramic diffusion barrier prepared by a conventional two-step arc ion plating (AIP) on the superalloy substrate would reduce the interfacial adhesive strength. In this paper, the multilayer system of Ni-Cr-Al-Y-Si overlayer with a DB and a bond coat (BC) was deposited on the DSM11 substrate by one-step AIP. The anti-oxidation property, the anti-diffusion ability of the barrier and the interfacial adhesive strength of the multilayer system were investigated. The results indicate that the multilayer can provide more effective protection for the DSM11 substrate than the single coating at high temperature. After 100 h thermal exposure at 1050 degrees C. the surface Al2O3 scales are continuous, dense, and only very little amounts of alloy elements diffused from the substrate is detected in the overlayer. After 100 cyc cycles between 1050 degrees C and room temperature (RT), the barrier layer has still well adhesive to the overlayer and the substrate. The tensile adhesion test shows that the interfacial adhesive strength is 63.6 MPa for the annealed multilayer system, which is about 20 MPa higher than that of the coating system with a DB on the DSM11 substrate deposited by the two-step AIP. The one-step AIP method can increase the interfacial adhesive strength and improve the anti-oxidation performance of the multilayer with DB.

TI Study on 3d-Shell Electrons and Bond Configuration in Ni-Co-Cr
   Superalloys by Positron Annihilation Spectroscopy
SO RARE METAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING
AB Doppler-broadening spectra of positron annihilation radiation for pure metals Ni, Co and Cr and Ni-Co-Cr alloys with three different chemical compositions were measured by 2-detector coincidence technique. And the effect of the 3d electrons on Ni-Co-Cr alloy formation was analyzed. The results show that the 3d electron signal for the metal Ni is relatively higher among the three pure metals. The increase of Ni atom proportion in Ni-Co-Cr alloys leads to an increase in the probability of positron annihilation with free electrons. The experimental ratio curves for three Ni-Co-Cr alloys are greatly similar to the corresponding theoretic ratio curves, which indicate that the bonding nature in Ni-Co-Cr alloys is mainly metallic. This can explain why the Ni-Co-Cr alloys have good metal ductility.

TI Grain Growth Behaviors of New Ni-Co Base Disk Superalloys during
   Solution Heat Treatment
SO JOURNAL OF THE JAPAN INSTITUTE OF METALS
AB The grain growth behaviors of a new Ni-Co-base superalloy (TMW-4M3) at various temperatures from 1100 degrees C to 1200 degrees C were investigated. The grain grew slowly below solvus temperature, T-s (T-s approximate to 1162 degrees C) and grew very quickly above the temperature because the primary gamma' dissolved completely. Therefore, we suggest that T-s approximate to 1162 degrees C is the gamma' solvus temperature for TMW-4M3 alloy. Meanwhile, below the gamma' solvus temperature, we found that the grain radius, R (pm) was a function of precipitate radius, r(gamma') (mu m) and volume fraction, f(v), of the primary gamma' phase, which could be expressed as,
   R=0.711.4.r(gamma')/integral v
   Thus, the grain growth behavior of the alloy within the gamma' sub-solvus temperature range, showed a good agreement with the Zener model.

Experiments were performed with exactly the same working head and experimental configuration. Results obtained allow affirming that a high brightness laser is only useful when very narrow coatings are required. A conventional Nd:YAG laser is a suitable source for large area coatings.

TI THERMODYNAMIC STUDY ON EQUILIBRIUM PRECIPITATION PHASES IN A NOVEL Ni-Co
   BASE SUPERALLOY
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB Thermodynamic properties of the traditional U720Li alloy and the new Ni-Co base superalloy have been studied using JMatPro and the latest relevant database for Ni base superalloys. The effects of chemical composition on the equilibrium precipitation phases, process-ability and gamma/gamma' mismatch have been analyzed. It is found that the gamma/gamma' mismatch increases with the increase of Ti/Al (atomic ratio). The volume fraction of gamma' is proportional to the Ti+Al contents (atomic fraction). Therefore, by increasing the Ti/Al ratio and Ti+Al content, the yield strength of alloys can be improved. On the other hand, the gamma' solvus temperature decreases by Co additions. As a result, the range of processing temperature is extended. The gamma/gamma' mismatch also increases with Co additions, which adds additional strengthening to the alloy. Moreover, high Ti/Al ratio or low Co content promotes the precipitation of eta phase. Thus, Ni-Co base superalloys with high Ti+Al content, Ti/Al ratio and Co content bear an improved strength, phase stabilities and process-ability.

TI Characterization of hot deformation behavior of a new Ni-Cr-Co based P/M
   superalloy
SO MATERIALS CHARACTERIZATION
AB The hot deformation behavior of a new Ni-Cr-Co based P/M superalloy was studied in the temperature range of 950-1150 degrees C and strain rate range of 0.0003-1 s(-1) using hot compression tests. It was characterized by true stress true strain curves, constitutive equation, strain rate sensitivity m contour maps, power dissipation eta maps and hot processing maps. The microstructural validation of processing maps was also done. The results show that the flow stress decreases with increasing temperature and decreasing strain rate. The hot deformation apparent activation energy of the Ni-Cr-Co based P/M superalloy at peak stress is 805 kJ/mol. The m and eta contour maps are similar, and the values of m and eta the peak zones increase with increasing strain. When the strain is 0.5, a domain with its peak eta of 40% and peak m of 25% occurs at 1050 degrees C and 0.0003 s(-1), which corresponds to dynamic recrystallization and can be as an optimum condition for good workability.

AB A novel ion-plasma process for ecologically safe formation of diffusion aluminide coatings on a substrate made of a superalloy, which has advantages as compared to the well-known thermodiffusion processes of their production, is described. The ion-plasma process is shown to provide the formation of diffusion aluminide coatings on the surface of a superalloy substrate according to various technologies. Owing to alloying with one or several elements from the series Y, Si, Cr, Hf, B, Co, etc., ion-plasma diffusion coatings have higher protective properties than analogous coatings produced by the traditional methods of powder, slip, and gas-circulating aluminizing.

TI ANTI-FRICTION BEHAVIORS OF SEVERAL SYNTHESIZED PERRHENATES
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB For exploring the possibility of a. hybrid mode With smooth transition from fluid to boundary even to solid lubrication at the elevated temperature, i.e., searching a substance which should be the solid lubricant. and oil additive with environmentally friendly. characters; a Series of perrhenates (the soft double oxide) were synthesized as the candidates because of their crystalline and decomposed products with a good anti-friction behaviour, such a Re2O7 which might provide the lubrication during Oil decomposition for its good sublimation kit about. 300 degrees C. This investigation might, be advantage of lubrication for rubbing part's of internal combustion or turbo engine such as piston ring and cylinder liner or exchanger; which were always operated in a. cyclical variation of temperature (even to 800 degrees C).
   In this paper, the properties of perrhenates of Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Pb, Ca, Ba and La synthesized by aqua-solution method were described and their crystalline structures, compositions and morphologies were determined by XRD, SEM-EDS For understanding their lubricating behaviors in both dry sliding base oil pentaerythritol ester (PETE), their lubricating behaviors between Si3N4 ball and superalloy disc were tested in pin-on-disc Oil universal micro-tribotester (UMT-2) from 20 to 750 degrees C. The results show that most synthesized perrhenates ale crystal powder except the synthesized gel-like ferric perrhenate, their crystalline structures are coincidence with powder diffraction file (PDF) cards, and compositions are very close to the stoichiometic values Some of the synthesized perrhenates exhibit certain lubrication at 300-750 degrees C, in both dry sliding and oil lubrication With addition of the synthesized perrhenate which were verified in reciprocating sliding The variation of friction coefficients temperature probably results from the formation or removal of soft oxides at, high temperature The good anti-frictional behaviors of the synthesized perrhenates of Ca, Co and Cu in a, wide temperature range seem to imply. them to be developed as the candidates of additive in a hybrid lubricating mode for the engine operating in cyclical variation of temperature.

These deleterious phases grow mainly by diffusion process in the superalloy substrate. Significant volume change was found because of growth of the p phase in Co-Mo system. Growth kinetics of this phase and different diffusion parameters, like interdiffusion, intrinsic and tracer diffusion coefficients are calculated. Further the activation energy, which provides an idea about the mechanism, is determined. Moreover, the interdiffusion coefficient in Co(Mo) solid solution and impurity diffusion coefficient of Mo in Co are determined. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Microstructural Observations on Oxidized Ni-Based Superalloy TMS-75 and
   PGM-Doped Derivatives
SO JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB The isothermal oxidation behavior of experimental third and fourth generation Ni-based superalloys was studied at temperatures between 900 and 1100 degrees C. It was found that the lower Cr concentration in third and fourth generation alloys compared to second generation alloys negatively affects the ability of the alloy to form and maintain a protective alumina scale especially at lower temperatures (900 degrees C). An extensive internal reaction zone comprised of oxide and nitride phases is observed underneath a nonprotective external oxide scale. At higher temperatures, a continuous alumina scale forms underneath (Ni,Co)O and spinel layers. Due to the low level of reactive element (RE) additions in these experimental alloys, scale adhesion is poor. An increase of Cr content is necessary to ensure formation of a protective alumina scale at lower temperatures. Addition of Y and/or Zr is recommended for improved oxide adhesion, resulting in better overall oxidation performance. (C) 2010 The Electrochemical Society.

AB Co-based composite coatings reinforced by TiN particles were fabricated on Ni-based superalloy substrate by using a 5 kW CO(2) laser. The microstructures and phases constitution of the composite coating were studied by means of optical microscope (OM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The microhardness and wear resistance of the coating were also examined. The results showed that the composite coating was mainly composed of gamma-Co, TiN, TiC, (Cr, W)(23)C(6) and Co(3)Ti. And different solidification morphologies, such as planar, cellular and dendrite, were obtained. Structural transformations were attributed to the temperature gradient and solidification rate in metal-melting region. It was found that the microhardness of the composite coating was enhanced prominently as compared to the substrate region, which should be due to the undissolved TiN and other new complicated phase. Friction and wear tests without lubrication showed that the addition of TiN particles into Co-based coating can improve its wear resistance significantly without evidently increasing the friction coefficient of coating.

The fabrication of a complete TBC system with a porous and adherent Yttria Stabilized Zirconia (YSZ) layer on a bond-coating is also demonstrated, as well as the fabrication of a CoNiCrAlY-based cermet coating for abradable seal application. Difficulties of fabrication are reviewed, such as Y segregation, risks of carburization, local over-heating, or difficulty to coat complex shaped parts. Solutions are given to overcome these difficulties.

AB HAYNES 188 (HN-188)* is a commonly used Co-Ni-Cr-W superalloy since 1960s (*HAYNES is a registered trademark of Haynes International, Kokomo, IN, USA). Because of its excellent high temperature strength, good resistance to hot corrosion, and wear resistance, HN-188 has found extensive applications such as afterburner components and combustors. Even the alloy has been investigated previously, new industrial processes such as laser beam applications i.e., laser beam welding, and laser powder deposition, increase the demand on theoretical and experimental knowledge. In this research, laser beam welding characteristics of HN-188 superalloy (2.1 mm thick) were investigated. Two different heat inputs (61.3 J/mm and 90.1 J/mm) and travel speeds (46.5 mm/s and 22.2 mm/s) were applied. The base metal (BM), fusion zone (FZ), heat affected zone (HAZ) and the geometry of weld seams were characterized using optical microscopy (OM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM).

   MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB The compositional and microstructural evolution of different generations of precipitates of the ordered gamma' phase during the continuous cooling, followed by isothermal aging, of a commercial nickel-base superalloy, Rene 88DT, has been characterized by three-dimensional atom probe (3DAP) tomography coupled with energy-filtered transmission electron microscopy (EFTEM) Studies. After solutionizing in the single gamma-phase field, during continuous cooling at a relatively slow rate (-24 degrees C/min), the first-generation primary gamma' precipitates, Forming at relatively higher temperatures, exhibit near-equilibrium compositions, while the smaller-scale secondary gamma' precipitates, forming at lower temperatures, exhibit nonequilibrium compositions often containing an excess of Co and Cr while being depleted in Al and Ti content. The compositions of the gamma matrix near these precipitates also exhibit similar trends, with the composition being closer to equilibrium near the primary precipitates as compared to the secondary precipitates. Subsequent isothermal aging at 760 degrees C leads to coarsening of the primary gamma' precipitates without affecting their composition significantly. In contrast, the composition of the secondary gamma' precipitates is driven toward equilibrium during the isothermal aging process.

TI Wetting and interfacial behavior of Ni-Si alloy on different substrates
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Wetting of molten Ni-56 at.% Si alloy on different substrates (SiC ceramic, Ni- and Co-based superalloys, Kovar, and Mo) are performed under different experimental conditions by the sessile drop technique. Temperature, atmosphere, and substrate composition play the key roles in determining the wettability, the spreading characteristics, and the interfacial morphology of the final interfaces. The non-reactive wetting characteristics in Ni-Si/SiC system are confirmed, with a spreading rate increasing with temperature increasing. In the Ni-Si/metal systems the spreading process is determined by the competition between spreading along the substrate surface and the interfacial interactions. Excellent wettability and fast spreading are found in the Ni-Si/Co-based superalloy, Ni-Si/Kovar, and Ni-Si/Mo systems at both the temperatures (1100 and 1200 A degrees C). These results can be used as a reference guide for joining SiC to these metallic components, or to itself, using the Ni-Si alloy as filler metal.

TI STUDY OF A NEW-TYPE HIGH STRENGTH Ni-BASED SUPERALLOY DZ68 WITH GOOD HOT
   CORROSION RESISTANCE
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB In order to meet the requirements of marine gas turbine blade materials, a, new-type directional solidification Ni-based superalloy named DZ68 was developed. The alloy composition was designed by low segregation technology. Its nominal chemical composition (mass fraction, %) is C 0.05, Cr 12.0, Mo 1.0, W 5.0, Co 8.5, Al 5.3, Ti 0.5, Ta 5.0, Re 2.0, B 0.01, and balance is Ni. The microstructures of as-east DZ68 alloy and after heat treatment states were analyzed by OM, SEM and XRD. The tensile, rupture and hot corrosion resistance properties of DZ68 alloy were compared with DZ125 and IN738 alloys. Results show that the microstructure of as-cast DZ68 alloy is composed of gamma, gamma', (gamma+gamma') eutectics, MC type carbides and a few borides. After heat treatment, the microstructure of DZ68 alloy is composed of gamma, gamma' and carbides. The carbides are mainly MC and M23C6. The tensile strength of DZ68 alloy decreases slightly with the increase of temperature, and reaches its minimum value at 700 degrees C. When the temperature is higher than 700 degrees C, the tensile strength increases so evidently that reaches its maximum at once at 760 degrees C, But when the temperature is higher than 760 degrees C its tensile strength decreases obviously. It is well recognized the relationship of the tensile strength of DZ68 alloy with temperature is abnormal, similar to that of its yield strength but opposite to that of its plasticity. The tensile and rupture properties of DZ68 alloy are nearly the same as those of DZ125 alloy and its hot corrosion resistance property is nearly the same as that of IN738 alloy under the same conditions.

TI CHARACTERISTIC AND FORMATION MECHANISM OF PRECIPITATES AT
   RECRYSTALLIZATION GRAIN BOUNDARIES OF SINGLE CRYSTAL SUPERALLOY DD6
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB Single crystal superalloys have extremely good elevated temperature capability in advanced gas turbine aero engines due to no highly stressed grain boundaries in them. With the removal of grain boundary strengthening elements such as C, B and Zr, the occurrence of recrystallization may be detrimental to their performance. Therefore, recrystallization becomes critical in industrial manufacture of single crystal superalloy blades. In the present study, specimens of single crystal superalloy DD6 were grit blasted, solution treated and aged at vacuum atmosphere, and then the precipitates at recrystallization grain boundaries were investigated by SEM, TEM, EPMA and Thermo-Calc. The results show that a few of M6C carbides precipitate at recrystallization grain boundaries, and their size is about 0.5 mu m. These M6C carbides are rich in W, Re and Mo, but poor in Al, Ta, Ni, the contents of Cr, Nb, Co in them are almost the same as the nominal composition of DD6 alloy. The carbon accumulation at recrystallization boundaries and combination with mu phase forming elements such as W and Mo restrain the p, phase forming. M23C6 phase hardly forms in DD6 alloy due to its high W and low Cr content.

TI HIGH TEMPERATURE OXIDATION BEHAVIORS OF TWO Ni-Co-Cr-Al-Si-Y COATINGS
   DEPOSITED BY ARC ION PALTING
SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB Two Ni-Co-Cr-Al-Si-Y (M14 and M19) coatings with different Al and Cr contents were deposited onto DD32 Ni-base superalloy substrate using arc ion plating (AIP) method. The microstructures, isothermal oxidation behaviors at 1000 and 1100 degrees C and cyclic oxidation behaviors between room temperature and 1000 degrees C of the both coatings were investigated. The results show that these two coatings are composed of gamma'/gamma, beta-NiAl and some alpha-Cr precipitate phases. The only difference is that there are more beta-NiAl phase precipitates in M19 coating with high Al content. M19 coating, in contrast to M14 coating, can not only repair destroyed alumina scales effectively during isothermal oxidation, but also resist further cracking and spalling of alumina scales during cyclic oxidation. High Al content in M19 coating can be kept under long time oxidation, making M19 coating long-term service.

AB The high-temperature deformation behavior of Co-28Cr-6Mo-0.16N alloy was investigated by carrying out compression tests for determination of the optimum hot-forging conditions; the tests were carried out in the temperature range of 1000-1200 degrees C and strain rates ranging from 0.01 to 50 s(-1) with a height reduction of 50%. The optimum hot-working conditions were decided from the processing map based on the dynamic materials model (DMM). Dynamic recrystallization (DRX) occurred over the entire temperature and strain rate range. However, uniformly sized grains were formed for strain rates higher than 10 s(-1), which is considered the optimum hot-working condition. The characteristic microstructures predicted from the processing map agreed well with the results of microstructural observations. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Solidification and Segregation Behaviors with Solidification Rate in Co
   base superalloy, FSX-414
SO JOURNAL OF THE KOREAN INSTITUTE OF METALS AND MATERIALS
AB Co base superalloys have been widely used for the parts of gas turbine due to their excellent strength, thermal fatigue, oxidation resistance and weldability at high temperature. In this study, directional solidifications were carried out at various solidification rates, including 0.5 similar to 300 mu m/s in the Co base superalloy FSX-414. The cellular interface were formed at a low solidification rate, 1 mu m/s, and the dendritic interface was found at higher solidification rates, 5 similar to 300 mu m/s. As the spacing of dendrite structure decreased, the size and spacing of eutectics decreased. Dendrite arm spacing decreased with increasing solidification rates and temperature gradient. It was interesting to find the M23C6 eutectic microstructure formed between gamma dendrites. Composition analysis showed that Cr and W were segregated severely between the dendrites, which resulted in the formation of Cr-rich M23C6 and W-rich MC carbides.

AB The oxidation behaviour of model Co-Re based alloys at 1000 degrees C in air has been investigated. Thermogravimetric studies in combination with microstructural examinations of Co-Re alloys with different compositions showed the negative influence on the oxidation resistance of Co based alloys due to the evaporation of rhenium oxide(s). Oxidation at 1000 degrees C in air yielded an oxide scale, which consists of a Co oxide outer layer on a thick and porous mixed Co-Cr oxide and a semicontinuous and therefore non-protective Cr oxide film on the base metal substrate. This allows the vaporisation of rhenium oxide formed during oxidation and leads to a loss of Re. In addition, computer aided thermodynamic calculations were carried out to supplement the experimental analyses.

TI Deformation and Microstructure Evolution in Co-Ni-Cr-Mo Superalloy
   during Hot Working
SO METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND
   MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Deformation and microstructure evolution in Co-33Ni-20Cr-10Mo superalloy during hot deformation are studied by carrying out compression tests between 950 A degrees C and 1200 A degrees C with an increment of 50 A degrees C at strain rates of 0.1, 1, 10, and 30 s(-1). The flow curves obtained for the aforementioned strain rates in this temperature range show that this alloy has high work-hardening characteristics; this is due to the strong dislocation-solute interactions associated with dynamic strain aging (DSA). Microstructures deformed at temperatures up to 1050 A degrees C consist of numerous deformation twins and highly dense dislocations, which are attributed to the high activation energy for deformation and the relatively low strain-rate sensitivity m in the temperature range of 950 A degrees C to 1200 A degrees C. Dynamic recrystallization (DRX), which is dependent on the strain rate, occurs at T = 1000 A degrees C, 1050 A degrees C, 1100 A degrees C, 1150 A degrees C, and 1200 A degrees C.

   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING
AB Direct metal deposition technology is an emerging laser aided manufacturing technology based on a new additive manufacturing principle, which combines laser cladding with rapid prototyping into a solid freeform fabrication process that can be used to manufacture near net shape components from their CAD files. In the present study, direct metal deposition technology was successfully used to fabricate a series of samples of the Ni-based superalloy Inconel 625. A high power CO(2) laser was used to create a molten pool on the Inconel 625 substrate into which an Inconel 625 powder stream was delivered to create a 3D object. The structure and properties of the deposits were investigated using optical and scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and microhardness test. The microstructure has been found to be columnar dendritic in nature, which grew epitaxially from the substrate. The thermal stability of the dendritic morphology was investigated in the temperature range 800-1200 degrees C. These studies demonstrate that Inconel 625 is an attractive material for laser deposition as all samples produced in this study are free from relevant defects such as cracks, bonding error and porosity.

AB A composite coating (MCrAlY+AlSiY) was prepared on a Ni-based superalloy K465 by arc ion plating technique. The oxidation behaviors of the composite coating and the reference coating NiCoCrAlYSiB were investigated. The results show that the outer layer of composite coating consists of beta-(Ni, Co)Al and dispersed sigma-NiCoCr and Cr3Si, and the inner layer of composite coating consists of Cr-rich phases and minor beta-(Ni, Co)Al after vacuum annealing at 1050 degrees C. Because of the excessive consumption of Al, the spinels and NiO are formed on the surface of the reference coating. For the composite coating, the protective alumina scale is continuous and dense. The enhanced oxidation resistance of the composite coating is related to the gradient distributions of Al-enriched outer layer and Cr-enriched inner layer.

SO ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA
AB The hot corrosion resistance of a new directional solidification (DS) Ni-based super-alloy DZ68 was studied and compared with K438 alloy. The results indicate that the microstructure of DZ68 alloy is more uniform than K438 alloy after heat treatment. There are small size carbides in the microstructure of DZ68 alloy after heat treatment, but there are big size carbides and a lot (gamma + gamma') eutectic in the microstructure of K438 alloy. The hot corrosion of DZ68 alloy is uniform, and the corrosion products are mainly (Ni, Co)Cr2O4 and Al2O3, More (Ni, Co)Cr2O4 exists in outer corrosion layer and more Al2O3 exists in inner corrosion layer. For the K438 alloy the hot corrosion is not uniform, NiO is the mainly corrosion product in outer corrosion layer and CrS is the main corrosion product in inner corrosion layer, Moreover, the segregation of Ti can induce segregation of other elements in the two alloys, which leads to a severe local corrosion of alloys. Under the same experimental condition, the corrosion resistance of DZ68 alloy is a little better than that of K438 alloy.

TI Fatigue crack growth mechanisms in superalloys: overview
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Fatigue studies on disc and blade nickel based superalloys by the author and co-workers are reviewed. Crack initiation in single crystal turbine blade alloys is dominated by interdendritic porosity with oxidation processes affecting initiation position. Lifetime trends can be modelled using a multipart Paris type lifing approach. Orientation, loading state, temperature and environment determine stage I/II crack growth mechanisms and the resulting crack path and should be considered in lifing. Mechanistic insights on how complex stress states, subsurface failures and different temperatures/environments affect fatigue processes can thus improve turbine blade lifing, and direct alloy development programmes. In polycrystalline disc alloys cracks at high temperature may initiate at oxidised subsurface carbides or porosity. Grain size controls cycle and time dependent crack growth: the benefits of increased grain size in resisting grain boundary attack mechanisms predominate over those of gamma' distribution variation. Optimising grain boundary character and distribution should yield the best alloy design strategy for high temperature fatigue performance in turbine discs.

TI On oxidation behaviour of platinum aluminide coated nickel based
   superalloy CMSX-(4)
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The effects of platinum modification on the isothermal oxidation performance of a chemical vapour deposition aluminide coating are examined. Platinum was electrodeposited to varying thicknesses (to a maximum of 16 mu m) onto the CMSX-4 single crystal superalloy, before applying a high temperature/low activity aluminisation process. The oxidation performance at 1100 degrees C improved monotonically with increasing Pt thickness; this was confirmed by thermal gravimetric analysis. The degree of rumpling of the alumina scale was also decreased with increasing platinum. The superior oxidation resistance of platinum modified aluminide coatings is a consequence of the beta-NiAl formed during aluminisation containing an enhanced Al/Ni ratio, reduced levels of Co and Ti and decreased concentrations of the refractory elements Re, W and Ta. This seems to be due at least in part to the microstructural effects caused by the prior diffusion of platinum into the surface, which causes the generation of a gamma-(Ni,Pt)/gamma'-(Ni,Pt)(3)Al microstructure; the upper portion of the Pt diffused coating comprises predominantly the gamma'-(Ni,Pt)(3)Al phase which is rich in Pt and Al and depleted in Co and the refractory elements W and Re. The ramifications of our findings for the design of bond coats required for thermal barrier coating systems are discussed.

AB Platinum (Pt)-modified aluminide coatings were developed by electroplating a thin layer of Pt followed by an industrial vapor phase aluminizing process. The goal of this work was to systematically investigate the effect of critical coating process parameters (such as the electroplated Pt thicknesses, Al contents in Cr-Al nuggets, diffusion heat treatments) and substrates on the final Pt-modified aluminide coatings. Surface morphology and cross-section microstructure of the developed coatings were inspected and compared by using Optical Microscope, Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). Experimental results showed that the Al and/or Pt increase shall favor the formation of xi-PtAl(2) phase; transformation of xi-PtAl(2) into beta-(Ni,Pt)Al phase can be obtained via a heat treatment process; Cr, Co elements in the studied Ni-base superalloy substrates did not show significant influence on coating outer layer microstructure; while substrate elements affect the microstructure of the coating interdiffusion layer.

Sintering behaviour, microstructure development and phase composition were characterised by dilatometer measurements, X-ray diffraction, light and scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray analysis, for different variants of the process. Composites of nominal same composition sintered without the metal foam preform show no metallic interpenetration.

CL Grand Teton Natl Park, WY
AB The study of hydrogen embrittlement of materials has not as of yet led to methods that can be used to design safe and reliable hydrogen containment components in which hydrogen-induced degradation is associated with subcritical crack growth. For example, current design guidelines for pipelines only tacitly address subcritical cracking by applying arbitrary, conservative safety factors on the applied stress. In an effort to understand the mechanics of sustained-load cracking in a gaseous hydrogen environment, we investigate crack propagation in the Fe-Ni-Co superalloy IN903 for which experiments by Moody et al. [1] suggest that hydrogen promotes failure by intergranular cracking at pressures greater than 100MPa. In the present work, we model the hydrogen effect on grain boundary cohesion through the thermodynamic theory of Mishin et al. [2] which addresses transient separation accounting for the rate of hydrogen diffusion into the separating interface. We calibrate the parameters of the theory through first-principles calculations and information from the experiments and we simulate crack propagation by cohesive finite element methodology. The results reveal a number of issues related to the complexity of the failure mechanism and the robustness of the cohesive element methodology.

TI Oxidation of a Zr-doped NiAl bondcoat thermochemically deposited on a

SO MATERIALS AT HIGH TEMPERATURES
AB Thermal barrier systems are used to protect aeronautical turbine blades from heat and oxidation. Three component parts are involved: a nickel-based superalloy, an intermetallic bondcoat that forms a protective alumina scale and a zirconia topcoat that acts as the thermal barrier. The present work focuses on the oxidation behaviour of a NiAl bondcoat doped with a reactive element. The Studied system includes an AMI superalloy coated with a NiAl(Zr) layer innovatively obtained by thermochemical co-deposition of Al and Zr in the vapour phase. Cyclic and isothermal oxidation tests were performed and the long-term oxidised samples were characterised by scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy and time of flight-second ion mass spectrometry analyses were conducted after very short-time oxidation tests. The results show that adding Zr to the coating is beneficial to the oxidation resistance and to the oxide scale adhesion. Major segregation of Zr is obtained in the initial stages of oxide growth.

Rather than replacing with new components, innovative repairs can help reduce overhaul and maintenance costs. These components are cast from either Co-based solid solution superalloys such as FSX-414, or Ni-based gamma prime precipitation strengthened superalloys such as IN738. The nominal compositions of FSX-414 and IN738 are Co-29.5Cr-10.5N1-7W-2Fe [max]-0.25C-0.012B and Ni-0.001B -0.17C-8.5Co-16Cr-1.7Mo-3.4Al-2.6W-1.7Ta-2Nb-3.4Ti-0.1Zr, respectively.
   Diffusion brazing has been used for over four decades to repair cracks and degradation on these types of components. Typically, braze materials utilized for component repairs are Ni and Co-based braze fillers containing B and/or Si as melting point depressants. Especially when repairing wide cracks typically found on industrial gas turbine components, these melting point depressants can form brittle intermetallic boride and silicide phases that effect mechanical properties such as low cycle and thermal fatigue. The objective of this work is to investigate and evaluate the use of hyper-eutectic Ni-Cr-Hf and Ni-Cr-Zr braze filler metals, where the melting point depressant is no longer B, but Hf and/or Zr. Typically, with joint gaps or crack widths less than 0.15mm, the braze filler metal alone can be utilized. For cracks greater than 0.15mm, a superalloy powder is mixed with the braze filler metal to enable wide cracks to be successfully braze repaired. As a means of qualifying the diffusion braze repair, both metallurgical and mechanical property evaluations were carried out. The metallurgical evaluation consisted of optical and scanning electron microscopy, and microprobe analysis. The diffusion brazed area consisted of a fine-grained equiaxed structure, with carbide phases, gamma [gamma] dendrites, flower shaped/rosette gamma-gamma' [gamma-gamma prime] eutectic phases and Ni(7)Hf(2), Ni(5)HF, or Ni(5)Zr intermetallic phases dispersed both intergranularly and intragranularly. Hardness tests showed that the Ni-Hf and Ni-Zr intermetallic phase only has a hardness range of 250Hv to 400Hv; whereas, the typical Cr-boride phases have hardness ranges from 800Hv to 1000Hv Therefore the hardness values of the Ni-Hf and Ni-Zr intermetallic phases are 2.5-3.2 times softer than the Cr-boride intermetallic phases. As a result the LCF properties of the wide gap Ni-Cr-Hf and Ni-Cr-Zr brazed joints are superior to those of the Ni-Cr-B braze filler metals. The mechanical property evaluations were tensile tests at both room temperature and elevated temperature, stress rupture tests from 760 degrees C-1093 degrees C and finally low cycle fatigue [LCF] tests, the latter being one of the most important and severe tests to conduct, since the cracks being repaired are thermal fatigue driven. At the optimum braze thermal cycle, the mechanical test results achieved were a minimum of 80% and sometimes equivalent to that of the base metals properties.

AB The time dependent degradation of first-stage blades for gas turbine was investigated. First, Two used blades were prepared from the operating facilities, and their operating hours were 25,000 and 52,000 hrs, respectively. Microstructural comparison of coating surfaces showed that exposure to the environment increased thickness of TGO (Thermally Grown Oxide) and beta depletion region, and then debonding and spallation of TBC (Thermal Barrier Coating) occurred finally. In the case of substrate, Ni-based superalloy, the shape and size of gamma' were changed with increasing operating time. Especially, in the leading and trailing edges of blades, the size of gamma' was bigger and the shape was more elliptic than other region. It can be thought that the leading and trailing edges of blades can be the starting point of degradation in first-stage blades. Second, TBC failed blade used for 22,000 hrs was prepared and compared with other two blades. Large interfacial cracks were formed between top and bond coat, and TGO was not uniform and continuous. The chemical composition analysis on bond coat showed that low chromium content is responsible for the formation not only of Al oxide but also of Co, Cr, Ni oxides.

TI Investigations on role of HVOF sprayed Co and Ni based coatings to
   combat hot corrosion
SO CORROSION ENGINEERING SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB This paper aims to investigate the hot corrosion resistance of high velocity oxy-fuel (HVOF) sprayed cobalt based (Stellite-6) and nickel based (Ni-20Cr) coatings deposited on the superalloy Superni-718 (Ni-19Cr-18.5Fe-5.13Ta-3.05Mo-0.9Ti-0.5Al-0.18Mn-0.18Si-0.15Cu0.04C) in the Na(2)SO(4)-60%V(2)O(5) salt environment at 900 degrees C under cyclic conditions. The X-ray diffractometry, scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive analysis and electron probe microanalyser techniques were used to study the corrosion products with respect to their morphology, phase composition and element concentration. The thermogravimetric technique was used to establish the kinetics of corrosion. The bare alloy underwent severe hot corrosion attack. The Ni-20Cr coating shows excellent hot corrosion resistance with negligible spallation, whereas Stellite-6 coating reveals less hot corrosion resistance and more spallation. The hot corrosion resistance of Ni-20Cr coating has been attributed to the formation of oxides of chromium, nickel and spinel of nickel chromium. The oxides of silicon, chromium, cobalt and spinels of cobalt-chromium and nickel-chromium have contributed for hot corrosion resistance of Stellite-6 coatings.

TI Synthesis of simple and platinum-modified aluminide coatings on cobalt

SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB An investigation was conducted to synthesize simple beta-CoAl or beta-(Co,Ni)Al coatings and platinum (Pt)-modified aluminide coatings on cobalt-base superalloys via an industrial vapor phase aluminizing process. Surface morphology and cross-section microstructure of the developed coatings were studied and compared by using optical microscope, scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). Experimental results showed that Al increase in Al-Cr nuggets increases the coating thickness; substrate elements influence the formation of coatings; the increase of the electrodeposited Pt thickness increases the amount of xi PtAl(2) phase after aluminizing process; and the transformation of xi PtAl(2) phase into beta-(Co,Ni,Pt)Al phase can be obtained via a heat treatment process.

TI Preparation and hot corrosion behaviour of a MCrAlY plus AlSiY composite
   coating
SO CORROSION SCIENCE
AB A MCrAlY+AlSiY composite coating was prepared by arc ion plating. Hot corrosion behaviours of the composite coating and the reference NiCoCrAlYSiB coating were investigated. The results indicate that the composite coating consisted of beta-(Ni,Co)Al with dispersed sigma-NiCoCr and Cr3Si in outer layer and Cr-rich phases in inner layer after annealing. As being corroded for 200 h, the composite coating proved better corrosion resistance than that of reference NiCoCrAlYSiB coating. The enhanced corrosion resistance of the composite coating was due to the gradient distribution of Al-enriched outer layer and Cr-enriched inner layer. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Oxidation of a Co-base Superalloy
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB The oxidation behavior of a cast polycrystalline Co-base superalloy was studied at temperatures from 900 to 1050 degrees C and analyzed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results indicate that a cast Co-base superalloy follows the subparabolic oxidation kinetics at 900 and 1000 degrees C, which are controlled by the growth of the inner Cr-rich layer, and that after oxidation at 1050 degrees C for 200 h, it almost exhibits the linear oxidation kinetics possible due to the volatility of Cr-rich oxide. A mixed scale forms on the alloy after prolonged oxidation. The oxide scale formed at 900 and 1000 degrees C is composed of an outer layer of spinel and an inner continuous Cr-rich layer and at 1050 degrees C is composed of a very discontinuous Cr-rich layer.

TI Oxidation of single crystal PWA 1483 at 950 degrees C in flowing air
SO CORROSION SCIENCE
AB The oxidation behaviour of single crystal PWA 1483 at 950 degrees C was investigated by means of XRD, SEM and EDS. The Parabolic oxidation behaviour, as defined by mass gain and the respective oxide layer thicknesses, is characterized by a parabolic rate constant of about 4 x 10(-6) mg(2)/(cm(4) x s) and the formation of a multi-layered oxide scale. An outer scale contains a Ti-bearing thin film composed of TiO2 and NiTiO3 but mostly Cr in Cr2O3 and (Ni/Co)Cr2O4 besides NiTaO4. This outer scale is connected to a discontinuous layer of Al2O3 and an area of gamma'-depletion within the base material. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI A first-principles survey of the partitioning behaviors of alloying
   elements on gamma/gamma ' interface
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB A first-principles approach is proposed to investigate the partitioning behaviors of the alloying elements Re, Co, and Cr, and the influence of Ru and Ir addition on them. The results show that Re, Co, and Cr all partition strongly to the gamma matrix. The Ru addition decreases the gamma phase partitioning trend of Re, Co, and Cr. The results are consistent with the early experimental work. Besides Ru, Ir results in Re less strongly partitioning to gamma. Our study shows that the influence of Ru (or Ir) on the partitioning characteristics of alloying elements originates from the strong interactions between Ru(Ir)-Re-Ni through the d-d orbitals hybridization.

TI Oxidation behaviour of an Alloy 617 in very high-temperature air and

CY OCT, 2006
CL Korea Univ, Seoul, SOUTH KOREA

AB The oxidation characteristics of Alloy 617, a candidate structural material for the key components in the very high-temperature gas-cooled reactor (VHTR), were investigated. High-temperature oxidation tests were conducted at 900 and 1100 degrees C in air and helium environments and the results were analysed. Alloy 617 showed parabolic oxidation behaviour at 900 degrees C, but unstable oxidation behaviour at 1100 degrees C, even in a low oxygen-containing helium environment. The SEM micrographs also revealed that the surface oxides became unstable and non-continuous as the temperature or the exposure time increased. According to the elemental analysis, Cr-rich oxides were formed on the surface and Al-rich discrete internal oxides were formed below the surface oxide layer. After 100 h in 1100 degrees C air, the Cr-rich surface oxide became unstable and non-continuous, and the matrix elements like Ni and Co were exposed and oxidized. Depletion of grain boundary carbides as well as matrix carbides was observed during the oxidation in both environments. When tensile loading was applied during high-temperature oxidation, the thickness of the surface oxide layer, the internal oxidation, and decarburization were enhanced because of the increase in diffusion of oxidizing agent and gaseous reaction products. Such enhancement would have detrimental effects on the high-temperature mechanical properties, especially the creep resistance of Alloy 617 for the VHTR application. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Phase equilibria and microstructure on gamma ' phase in Co-Ni-Al-W
   system
SO MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS
AB Phase equilibria between the gamma and gamma' phases at 900 degrees C in the Co-(10-70)Ni-Al-W system were determined by electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) and X-ray diffractometry (XRD). It was found that the gamma' phase with L1(2) structure continuously exists from the Co side to the Ni side in Co-Ni-Al-W system and that it widens to the low W region with increasing Ni content. The partition of Al into the gamma' phase increased with Ni content, while the W changed from a gamma' former to a gamma former by increase of Ni content. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements also revealed that the gamma' solvus temperature increases with Ni content, while the solidus temperature is hardly affected by such content. The lattice parameter of the gamma and gamma' phases and the mismatch decreased with increasing Ni content, which caused the morphologic change of the gamma' precipitates from cubes to spheres.

TI Interfacial dislocation networks and creep in directional coarsened
   ru-containing nickel-base single-crystal superalloys
SO METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND
   MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Mechanisms of creep deformation in nickel-base superalloy single crystals in the directional coarsening regime have been studied in alloys with large variations in gamma-gamma ' lattice misfit and phase composition, achieved by Ru additions and variable levels of Cr and Co. Interfacial dislocation spacings established by long-term annealing experiments under no externally applied stress indicate that the experimental alloys have high-temperature lattice misfits ranging from near-zero to as large as -0.65 pct. Variation in misfit influences the stress-induced directional coarsening (rafting) behavior during creep deformation at 950 circle C and 290 MPa. In postcreep deformed material, the density of excess dislocations (defined as the dislocations beyond those necessary to relieve the lattice misfit) at the gamma-gamma degrees interfaces varied with alloy composition, with the most creep-resistant, alloy containing the highest excess interfacial dislocation density. In the directional coarsening creep regime, continued deformation requires shearing of the gamma ' rafts and is strongly influenced by the resistance of the precipitates to shearing as well as the interfacial dislocation structure. A preliminary model for creep in the rafting regime is developed.
